Naturally, the companys response to the on-going COVID-19 crisis took center stage in the open letter, as the virus has impacted the retailer giant at nearly every level. 
Among the meatier subjects detailed therein is more information on the Amazon-built testing labs that were announced last week. The executive notes in the letter that the company is considering regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms. The letter explains that, obviously, regular testing would be ideal to stop the diseases spread, as many cases are non-symptomatic. 
Its not entirely clear whether such testing would be mandatory, nor is it entirely clear where mandatory testing of employees showing no symptoms would fall legally. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions recently released ADA guidelines for the COVID outbreak, During a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat.
Of course, limited availability of testing has rendered the issue somewhat moot. What Amazon is building, however, is a testing lab designed specifically to test its own employees, in order to prohibit the viruss spread both within its own ranks and to the outside world. The company, after all, is a kind of retail lifeline for many Americans currently staying at home. Employees in at least 74 warehouse/fulfillment centers have tested positive for the virus, which is capable of living on cardboard for 24 hours and plastics for multiple days. The virus could potentially be transmitted through boxes and other surfaces. 
Weve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity, Bezos writes. A team of Amazoniansfrom research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineersmoved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will get in the relevant timeframe, but we think its worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.
The company has also implemented temperature checks at its building globally, designed to determine employees who might be carrying the virus. Other safeguards include routine sanitization of surfaces, the distribution of masks and mandated social distance. 
Earlier this week it came to light that the company had fired two more employees who had been vocally critical of its handling of the crisis, bringing the total up to three, including a Staten Island employee who lost his job last month. The company denied that the firings were connected to their public criticism, instead insisting, We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies."

The event was scheduled to be held June 16 to 19, 2020 in Las Vegas.
Organizers of the event said in a statement on its website that the event will be cancelled and guests who purchased tickets will receive a full refund. Here’s the statement:
Thank you for your interest in re:MARS 2020. Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, customers, partners, and event attendees. We have been closely monitoring the situation with COVID-19, and after much consideration, we have made the decision to cancel re:MARS 2020. All guests who have purchased tickets will receive a full refund of registration fees. Hotel rooms booked through our conference website will be canceled free of charge. Over the course of the coming weeks, we will explore other ways to engage the community.
Amazon launched re:MARS in 2019 and last year featured founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, Landing AI founder and CEO Andrew Ng, actor and producer Robert Downey, Jr., MIT Media Lab researcher Dr. Kate Darling and Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, and Zoox CEO Aicha Evans, among others.
COVID-19, a disease caused by a new virus that is a member of the coronavirus family and a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses. COVID-19 has caused governments and companies to cancel tech, business and automotive events around the world, including the NCAA March Madness basketball tournaments, professional sports games in the NBA  and NHL, the Geneva International Motor Show, MWC in Barcelona and the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Disneyland and California Adventure will close through the end of the month. On Friday, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, a designation that allows the government to free up more federal resources that states can access as they respond to outbreak.
Amazon issued guidance Thursday in response to the COVID-19 outbreak recommending that global employees who are able to work from home to do so through the end of March.
We continue to work closely with public and private medical experts to ensure we are taking the right precautions as the situation continues to evolve, an Amazon spokesperson said in an email statement. As a result, we are now recommending that all of our employees globally who are able to work from home do so through the end of March.
Earlier this week, Amazon said it would provide two weeks of extra paid time off for full and part-time employees who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine. The company said it will continue to pay all hourly employees, including food service, janitorial and security staff, who support its offices around the world."

“Like you, we are worried about the cities we love and call home, the people we serve, and our colleagues on the ground,” Lime wrote in a blog post today. “Loving cities means protecting them too. For now, we’re pausing Lime service to help people stay put and stay safe.”
The announcement came a day after San Francisco ordered residents to shelter in place, and shortly before New York City told residents to prepare for a shelter-in-place order. Lime will continue operating in other markets but says it has enhanced its cleaning and disinfecting methods.
Spin, on the other hand, is choosing not to suspend its service in San Francisco, unless the city explicitly asks it to. That’s because it’s betting the public transportation system will need support as people are taking essential trips to places like the grocery store or pharmacy.
“During this challenging time in our nation and in light of the CDCs guidance to avoid public transportation to limit exposure to COVID-19, we believe that Spin scooters can be another safe and reliable option,” Spin CEO Derrick Ko said in a statement. “To the extent that it is safe for our employees, we plan to work with the City to determine how best we can support the Citys desire and needs for continued safe operations of essential transportation, from rides to grocery stores and pharmacies to medical care and testing facilities.”
In a letter to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency yesterday, Ko outlined how Spin is ready and able to work to support health care workers, sanitation workers and other workers who may benefit from its scooters. Currently, Spin is more frequently disinfecting scooters and also encouraging riders to disinfect the handlebars before and after their ride. As for Lime, it says it will keep riders in the loop regarding when it will redeploy its scooters."

The company said its systems today rely on a combination of technology followed by human review. But the current health crisis is leading to reduced in-office staffing in certain sites, which means automated systems will be removing some YouTube content without human review.
Today, YouTube utilizes machine learning technology to flag potentially harmful content, which is then sent to human moderators for review. But because of the measures YouTube is taking to protect staff, it’s planning to rely more on technology than on people in the weeks ahead.
“We have teams at YouTube, as well as partner companies, that help us support and protect the YouTube communityfrom people who respond to user and creator questions, to reviewers who evaluate videos for possible policy violations,” YouTube explained in its announcement. “These teams and companies are staffed by thousands of people dedicated to helping users and creators. As the coronavirus response evolves, we are taking the steps needed to prioritize the well-being of our employees, our extended workforce, and the communities where they live, including reducing in-office staffing in certain sites.”
YouTube says allowing its technology to remove some content without human review, will allow it to work more quickly to take down potential violations and keep the ecosystem protected.
However, automated technology is not perfect. Many videos will likely be impacted by this shift away from human moderation. And videos may be removed even though their content wasn’t actually against YouTube policy. In those cases, video creators are being asked to appeal the decision, which will allow YouTube’s remaining moderators to take a look at the video in question and make a decision.
Because of these complications, YouTube informs creators they won’t be punished with strikes except in cases where YouTube has “high confidence” that the video content was in violation.
In addition, the company says it will also be more careful about which content gets promoted, including livestreams. Some unreviewed content may not be available in search, on the homepage, or in recommendations, either.
YouTube last week had said it would allow creators to monetize their videos about the novel coronavirus. Previously, those videos were a part of its advertising guidelines’ policy that prevented monetization of videos about “sensitive events” — like mass shootings, natural disasters, or, until now, health crises. YouTube’s original policy was written to protect advertisers from having their brands next to exploitative videos that were capitalizing on some sort of human tragedy for views. But YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said the company chose to re-open monetization on coronavirus videos because the topic was now an important part of everyday conversation — not a short-term even of a significant magnitude.
Today’s news, however, may put a damper on the creator community’s interest in making videos about the COVID-19 pandemic in the hopes of gaining more views for their channel. Creators will likely worry about their videos being suppressed by YouTube’s algorithms or even mistakenly removed. And videos may be stuck in a lengthier-than-usual appeals process given the reduced staffing.
YouTube additionally warned other areas of its business could also be affected going forward, including YouTube user and creator support and reviews, applications for the YouTube Partner Program, and even responses on social media channels.
It advised creators to watch the YouTube help center for further changes to the service.
“We recognize this may be a disruption for users and creators, but know this is the right thing to do for the people who work to keep YouTube safe and for the broader community. We appreciate everyones patience as we take these steps during this challenging time,” said YouTube."

While health is the priority across the world right now, the move is another blow to the potential prospects of a graduating class entering what looks to be a prolonged economic downturn.
In a statement to TechCrunch, a Yelp spokesperson said:
Yelp is actively monitoring the rapidly evolving situation surrounding the spread of COVID-19. Since the health and safety of our community is a top priority, we are taking a number of precautionary measures. We have encouraged, and in some cases mandated, employees in all of our offices to work from home, cancelled or postponed events, and prohibited international business travel and limited domestic travel to business critical needs. Due to our office closures and the challenges of onboarding interns while our entire workforce is remote, we have put our summer internship program on hold.
Earlier this month, schools across the country shut down and forced students to evacuate and attend classes remotely. Shutdowns have led to a migration home, alternative housing and scrappiness among educators to help students remain on track with curriculum.
Internships are a coveted resume booster and provide experience that students can use for networking and a potential job after graduation. It’s also a way that some companies increase their pipeline into more diverse communities. If tech companies cancel internships broadly, it could have a significant effect on hiring down the road.
Many other startups and larger tech companies have not yet publicly announced any decisions on the future of their internship programs. Others have told students that they are trying out a remote option or are waiting to make a call on whether to cancel or continue. That decision — and broader hiring freezes — will depend on the status of the government’s efforts to stop the COVID-19 outbreak over the coming months.
Uber, for example, said it will continue its program for the more than 400 interns set to join the ride-hailing company’s team. It is also continuing the programs around the world for its current intern group, which is 50 people strong. The company has switched to virtual onboarding and virtual intern events. It also is working on growing its manager and mentor trainings to “include new practices for managing during these challenging times.”
Salesforce said no changes have been made yet to its internship program. I reached out to Google, Facebook, and Lyft to ask them whether they have made any changes to their internship programs as well. I will update this post if I hear back.

It’s important to note upfront that regardless of what you may have heard, from Trump or any other sources, no drugs or treatments have been proven as effective for either the prevention of contracting COVID-19, or for its treatment.
That said, a number of different clinical studies are currently in progress all over the world, and in the U.S., the National Institutes of Health is looking to fill a 400-volunteer study that will provide clinical results related to use of remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by Gilead originally as a treatment for Ebola, but it’s still only in clinical trials even for treatment of that disease. This study could also add in other drug candidates as additional test therapies. Meanwhile, studies in China and France have examined the effectiveness of anti-malarial drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine including one small-scale study that suggests the positive effects of hydroxycholoroquine in reducing both the duration and symptoms of COVID-19 in combination with an antibiotic called azithromycin.
The important thing to keep in mind when considering these or any other potential treatments for the novel coronavirus, which is still relatively young, is that a lot of what we know about them so far is effectively anecdotal, and based not on the kind of scientifically rigours controlled clinical studies that are normally used in the years-long development and certification of drugs. Instead, treatments like remdesivir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are being deployed in the field by healthcare practitioners based on their approved use in similar (but crucially not the same) situations, like the Ebola and SARS outbreaks.
Often, they’re being used under what’s called ‘compassionate’ grounds in the U.S. This effectively amounts to employing a drug that’s not yet certified for general use in treatment of a patient whose condition is so severe that a doctor is willing to go to desperate lengths to try to alleviate their symptoms. This has the advantage of sidestepping typical testing and approval procedures, and requiring that the results of its use are documented, which contributes to the overall body of clinical knowledge in terms of its effects and interactions with patients and with COVID-19.
It’s not a clinical study, however, and that means there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to its use that just can’t be learned or asserted based on scattered, individual instances of compassionate care treatment.
“As the Commissioner of FDA and the President mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with the potential of an effect available to the American people, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective,” explained National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci during a press conference on Friday. “But the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal, it was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.”
During Thursday’s White House coronavirus pandemic task force briefing, Trump made false claims that chloroquine was already approved by the FDA as a treatment for COVID-19 under an emergency authorization. FDA Director Dr. Stephen Hahn clarified that this and remdesivir were being considered and studied by the FDA, as was an approach that would use plasma extracted from patients who’d recovered from COVID-19 as a potential source of antibodies for others. Still, all of these are still quite far away from clinical deployment in any generally approved way.
Meanwhile, Fauci’s cautions should be taken for what they are: Warnings that are primarily meant to emphasize that the reasons the FDA requires clinical studies, even for drugs already tentatively approved for use in other cases, is because it has patient health and safety in mind. While chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it can have dangerous side effects, including death, if taken incorrectly. Even when taken correctly, it can cause things like stomach distress, and even permanent damage to a person’s vision.
Fauci’s comments Friday explain the risks of putting too much stock in any potential treatment at this stage, even if they are showing promising results among small or even medium-sized deployments.
“You’ve got to be careful when you say fairly effective, it was never done in a clinical trial that compared it to anything,” he said in answer to a reporter’s question about chloroquine’s efficacy in treating SARS. “It was given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked […] Whenever you do a clinical trial, you do standard of care, versus standard of care plus the agent you’re evaluating. That’s the reason why we showed back in Ebola why particular interventions worked.”
A summary survey of various prospective treatments and their current status was published today In Medscape, and this includes the current state of remdesivir and chloroquine investigations, as well as a number of other drugs being studied by researchers. As has been reported here and elsewhere, there are promising signs that they could prove effective in either treatment, or treatment and even preventative use (in the case of remedesivir), but these are, as Dr. Fauci puts it, only the first step that should lead to more sophisticated clinical studies, which themselves will then need competing peer studies to eventually prove out."

In an email sent to staff today the Commission writes that president Ursula von der Leyen has activated a business continuity plan that requires all but those in “critical functions” to telework from next Monday.
Previously the EU’s executive body had been implementing limited teleworking for high risk employees such as those returning from Italy for 14 days after their return.
It’s not clear how many Commission staff are defined as carrying out “critical” functions — but it seems likely that thousands will be working from home or remotely next week. In all, the Commission employs around 32,000 people.
Per the email, staff deemed to be carrying out a critical function will already have been informed they are expected to continue to present at work, with “modalities” and “guidelines” to explain working arrangement slated to follow “soon”.
Earlier this week the European Parliament also told staff to prep for mass remote working Monday. Initially vulnerable staff with pre-existing health conditions had been told to telework to limit their risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus. 
The Commission had also already been instructing staff to switch to videoconferencing for missions, meetings and committees where possible.
Belgium, where the Commission is mainly based, has been reporting rising numbers of cases of Covid-19. Today its federal health authority reported 85 new cases today — bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 399.
The Commission itself reported the first cases (two) of Covid-19 among staff earlier this month. 
In recent weeks a number of politicians in countries across Europe have also been confirmed as having contracted the novel coronavirus."

Rumors around E3’s cancelation began swirling around last night, with a number of publications reporting from sources close to the show. 
Governing body the Entertainment Software Association made the news official. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, the ESA noted,
After careful consultation with our member companies regarding the health and safety of everyone in our industry our fans, our employees, our exhibitors and our longtime E3 partners we have made the difficult decision to cancel E3 2020, scheduled for June 9-11 in Los Angeles.
Following increased and overwhelming concerns about the COVID-19 virus, we felt this was the best way to proceed during such an unprecedented global situation. We are very disappointed that we are unable to hold this event for our fans and supporters.  But we know its the right decision based on the information we have today.
Our team will be reaching out directly to exhibitors and attendees with information about providing full refunds.
Held in Los Angeles during the summer, E3 continues to be one the worlds premier gaming shows. But struggles roughly a decade ago found the event transforming into a far leaner trade show, opening the doors to a number of competitors in the process. While it has managed to rebound to some degree, thanks in part to the decision to open its doors to the gaming public, E3s bottom line. Such a move could ultimately have a profound effect on the shows future, moving forward.
Even with Sonys decision to skip the show being announced back in January, 2020 was shaping up to be a big year for the event, with next generation versions of both the PlayStation and Xbox due out by years end. 
E3 is just the latest in a long line of tech shows that have closed up shop for the year, beginning with Mobile World Congress last month. Likely many will following Nintendo’s longstanding tradition of making announcements via webcast. The question for E3’s organizers, is whether those companies who move to an online approach will ultimately return in 2021.
The ESA is “exploring options” around offering elements of the event online."

Per this post on Blind — written by someone with a verified TripActions email address — the company fired 350 people. Business Insider reported the same figure yesterday. While the Wall Street Journal said the layoffs amount to between one-quarter to one-fifth of the startup’s total staff, citing a person familiar with the situation.
In an email to CrunchBase News TripActions confirmed it has axed jobs in response to the COVID-19 global health crisis — saying it has “cut back on all non-essential spend”. Although it did not confirm exactly how many employees it has fired.
“[We] made the very difficult decision to reduce our global workforce in line with the current climate,” TripActions wrote in the statement. “We look forward to when the strength of the global economy and business travel inevitably return and we can hire back our colleagues to rejoin us in our mission to make business travel effortless for our customers and users.”
This global health crisis is unlike anything weve ever seen in our lifetimes, and our hearts go out to everyone impacted around the world, including our own customers, partners, suppliers and employees,” it added. “The coronavirus has had [a] wide-reaching effect on the global economy. Every business has been impacted including TripActions. While we were fortunate to have recently raised funding and secured debt financing, we are taking appropriate steps in our business to ensure we are here for our customers and their travelers long into the future.”
Per the post on Blind, TripActions is providing one week of severance to sacked staff and medical cover until end of month. “With [the coronavirus pandemic] going on you think they would do better,” the OP wrote. The layoffs were made by Zoom call, they also said.
We’ve reached out to TripActions for comment.
Travel startups are facing an unprecedented nuclear winter as demand has fallen off a cliff globally — with little prospect of a substantial change to the freeze on most business travel in the coming months as rates of COVID-19 infections continue to grow exponentially outside China.
However TripActions is one of the highest valued and best financed of such startups — securing a $500M credit facility for a new corporate product only last month, when we noted Crunchbase had more than $480M in tracked equity funding for the company, including a $250M Series D TripActions raised in June from investors including a16z, Group 11, Lightspeed and Zeev Ventures.
Ahead of making the layoffs the company had already paused all hiring, per one former technical sourcer for the company writing on LinkedIn."

“When I first read the cancellation email, I didnt believe it. I refreshed my inbox; I rubbed my eyes as if I were waking up from a dream. It was clear that COVID-19 was becoming a mounting concern, but it never occurred to me that my internship was in jeopardy, Stafford said.
Internship cancellations hurt more than just summer plans. The programs are often pipelines into future jobs and access to valuable work experience.
For Stafford, a business and domestic environmental major from a small town in rural Utah, there are very few business and policy-related opportunities.
“I ask that employers do everything they can to make their internship opportunities more accessible in these upcoming months, and come next year and the year after, show understanding and compassion for employment gaps, she said.
Dozens of other students from across the country flooded my inbox, sharing stories about the impact on internship cancellations on their paths toward employment.
One student turned down offers and interviews from Google, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to pursue a software engineering position. The offer they accepted was yanked weeks later. Another student lost their chance at a post-graduate job at their dream company because their offer was revoked. One only had an offer in their hands for three weeks before it was rescinded.
A number of companies across the country, including Google, Glassdoor, StubHub, Funding Circle, Yelp, Checkr and even the National Institutes of Health, have canceled their internship programs due to COVID-19, TechCrunch has learned. The cancellations, which will likely increase in the days and weeks to come, are unsurprising, due to the uncertainty the pandemic has caused. Still, fewer internships jeopardize the postgraduate job prospects for thousands of college students, and, beyond that, limit the talent pipeline on which tech companies so often are dependent.

— Summer Internships 2020 (@hiring2020) March 25, 2020
From Denver to San Francisco
Like the concerts, conferences, universities and schools, these cancellations are because of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world right now. While some companies cited health concerns, others pointed to the uncertain economic landscape. 
In a statement, job search and review platform Glassdoor said the rapid spread of COVID-19 has grown beyond a health concern into an economic one. As a result, it has decided to pause hiring and reprioritize some initiatives internally to ensure we are well positioned for both the downturn and recovery. 
A Funding Circle spokesperson confirmed that the company halted its internship program, given the travel and relocation for the upcoming intern cohort to San Francisco. In an email obtained by TechCrunch, the National Institute of Health canceled its prestigious internship — which has a 20% acceptance rate — to stop community spread of Sars-Cov-2 through social distancing.
Therefore, hosting 1000+ early career scientists who deserve close supervision and intense mentoring is not appropriate at this time, the email reads. The cancellation of the NIH SIP applies to all students, whether you were planning to volunteer or were offered a fellowship position. It also applies, even if you were planning to do computational work that could be done remotely.
In a statement to TechCrunch, NIH said its program has been reduced to maintenance-only and mission critical (including research on COVID-19) operation due to spread of the novel coronavirus.
Regrettably, as part of this effort to keep people safe and limit the spread through social/physical distancing, it has been necessary to cancel the Summer Internship Program for young trainees at NIH for 2020, but those students already selected for the program will be given priority for summer internship positions in 2021.
Checkr, based in Denver and San Francisco, put its summer internship program on hold due to the challenges of onboarding interns while everyone is remote.
Google has rescinded some internship offers for its UX design internship, per a LinkedIn post. Google denied this. 
“If you log on to a laptop, you can access an opportunity”
While a number of tech companies have put their internship programs on hold, others are piecing together experimental remote internship programs for their students. 
Quizlet is preparing for its annual internship program and is preparing a contingency plan for an internship that will be virtual if necessary. Uber has formed a dedicated team to start working on an online internship program should the situation remain unchanged. Lyft and Twitter, depending on the state of the pandemic, plan to onboard San Francisco interns virtually.
The pandemic has certainly put remote internship management services in high demand. That said, a handful of startups have been working on the sector for years. 
San Francisco-based Symba, which helps companies offer virtual internship programs, was founded in 2017. Co-founder Ahva Sadeghi said that last week more than 100 companies and 1,000 students reached out to Symba in regards to internship cancellations because of COVID-19.
The companies we reached out to in the beginning who said, This is great but not top of mind for us, are now calling us back asking us to jump on the phone today or tomorrow to get something implemented, Sadeghi said in a phone call. We thought we didn’t have product-market fit and now the conversation has completely changed.
Sadeghi noted how internships assume a certain level of privilege in applicants, prioritizing those who can afford to move to a highly populated city with little to no pay. A remote internship, even in a time of health and prosperity, is important, she said.
If you can log on to a laptop, you can access an opportunity, she said. Another program, Chicago-based Sage Corps, founded in 2013, is pushing companies to sponsor the students impacted by internship cancellations. If sponsored, students can still participate in career growth development workshops virtually from Sage Corps, at $1,250 per student. 
Thomas Brunskill, the founder of InsideSherpa, which helps companies host virtual internships, said hes seen nearly 1,000 students a day sign up for the platform, from Northern Italy, to South-East Asia, to the United States. He started the company, which went through Y Combinator last year, to give students courses and online simulations of jobs through the comfort of their own homes.
He said his customers are mainly larger companies that employ upwards of 1,000 students, like JPMorgan Chase, Deloitte, Citi, BCG and GE.
On one end, Brunskill said the interest makes sense, as larger companies have to meet significant hiring demands. Per the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 70.4% of interns get return offers from the company where they intern. 
On the other end, this concentration further showcases how smaller businesses will be impacted disproportionately from this pandemic. Many will freeze hiring altogether.
Obviously [this] matters for students, but it also matters for companies who are now going to have this blackhole of talent, Brunskill said. Nobody wins in that situation — companies end up with less work-ready students who dont really know what theyre getting into and students end up in full-time jobs that might not be aligned to their interest or skills because they never had an opportunity to test it out first.
While layoffs are devastating, and obviously well upon us in the tech world, internship cancellations offer a harsh window into how COVID-19 doesnt just impact our current workforce, but our future one as well."

We are observing changing patterns of behaviors from threat actors and noticing waves of coronavirus-related cyberattacks.
To be clear, this trend is not unique to the global pandemic. Hackers have typically preyed on victims shortly after disasters or high-profile events around the world. Over the course of my career, I tracked notable global disasters that have been used as lures, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the mass shooting events in Las Vegas and the Zika virus outbreak. Malicious actors notoriously exploit human emotions for financial gain. Today, COVID-19 is not off-limits.
As threat actors continue adapting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic, the global workforce continues to change dramatically. With much of the world ordered to practice physical distancing, an unprecedented number of people are working remotely, many for the first time. Companies are rushing to provision laptops to employees with desktops, deploy collaborative software and implement VPN infrastructure to access internal tools. So, if you were a hacker, what would this opportunity look like for you?
Attack methods logically exploit changes in the global environment. Mass working over remote connection leads to mass remote login activity. This activity is mostly over private, insecure machines with user accounts that have not done so before therefore making remote login credentials an easy target for attackers.
Since Italy declared a state of emergency on January 31, 2020, information security professionals have recorded an escalation of cyberattacks in Italy reflecting this pattern. Breach protection company Cynet tracked a spike in phishing attacks in the last month in Italy, while non-quarantined countries withstood an unwavering number of attacks."

Hangzhou based AI startup Rokid is in talks with several companies to sell its T1 glasses in America, according to Rokid’s U.S. Director Liang Guan.
Rokid is among a wave of Chinese companies creating technology to address the coronavirus pandemic, which has dealt a blow to the countrys economy. 
Per info Guan provided, Rokid’s T1 thermal glasses use an infrared sensor to detect the temperatures of up to 200 people within two minutes from up to three meters away. The devices carry a Qualcomm CPU, 12 megapixel camera and offer augmented reality features for hands free voice controls to record live photos and videos.
The Chinese startup (with a San Francisco office) plans B2B sales of its wearable devices in the U.S. to assist businesses, hospitals and law enforcement with COVID-19 detection, according to Guan.
Rokid is also offering IoT and software solutions for facial recognition and data management, as part of its T1 packages.

The company is working on deals with U.S. hospitals and local municipalities to deliver shipments of the smart glasses, but could not disclose names due to confidentiality agreements.
One commercial venture that could use the thermal imaging wearables is California based e-commerce company Weee!.
The online grocer is evaluating Rokid’s T1 glasses to monitor temperatures of its warehouse employees throughout the day, Weee! founder Larry Liu confirmed to TechCrunch via email.
On procedures to manage those who exhibit COVID-19 related symptoms, that’s something for end-users to determine, according to Rokid. “The clients can do the follow-up action, such as giving them a mask or asking to work from home,” Guan said.
The T1 glasses connect via USB and can be set up for IoT capabilities for commercial clients to sync to their own platforms. The product could capture the attention of U.S. regulators, which have become increasingly wary of Chinese tech firms’ handling of American citizen data. Rokid says it doesn’t collect info from the T1 glasses directly.
“Regarding this module…we do not take any data to the cloud. For customers, privacy is very important to them. The data measurement is stored locally,” according to Guan.

Founded in 2014 by Eric Wong and Mingming Zhu, Rokid raised $100 million at the Series B level in 2018. The business focuses primarily on developing AI and AR tech for applications from manufacturing to gaming, but developed the T1 glasses in response to China’s COVID-19 outbreak.
The goal was to provide businesses and authorities a thermal imaging detection tool that is wearable, compact, mobile and more effective than the common options.
Large scanning stations, such as those used in some airports, have drawbacks in not being easily portable and handheld devices with infrared thermometers pose risks.
“You have to point them to people’s foreheads…you need to be really close, it’s not wearable and you’re not practicing social distancing to use those,” Guang said.
Rokid pivoted to create the T1 glasses shortly after COVID-19 broke out in China in late 2019. Other Chinese tech startups that have joined the virus-fighting mission include face recognition giant SenseTime which has installed thermal imaging systems at railway stations across China and its close rival Megvii, which has set up similar thermal solutions in supermarkets.
On Rokid’s motivations, “At the time we thought something like this can really help the frontline people still working,” Guang said.
The startup’s engineering team developed the T1 product in just under two months. In China, Rokid’s smart glasses have been used by national parks staff, in schools and by national authorities to screen for COVID-19 symptoms.
Temperature detectors have their limitation, however, as research has shown that more than half of China’s COVID-19 patients did not have a fever when admitted to hospital.
Source: Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Research Center
The growth rate of China’s coronavirus cases which peaked to 83,306 and led to 3,345 deaths has declined and parts of the country have begun to reopen from lockdown. There is still debate, however, about the veracity of data coming out of China on COVID-19. That led to a row between the White House and World Health Organization, which ultimately saw President Trump halt U.S. contributions to the global body this week.
As COVID-19 cases and related deaths continue to rise in the U.S., technological innovation will become central to the health response and finding some new normal for personal mobility and economic activity. That will certainly bring fresh facets to the common tech conundrums namely measuring efficacy and balancing benefits with personal privacy.
For its part, Rokid already has new features for its T1 thermal smart glasses in the works. The Chinese startup plans to upgrade the device to take multiple temperature readings simultaneously for up to four people at a time.
“That’s not on the market yet, but we will release this very soon as an update,” said Rokid’s U.S. Director Liang Guan ."

It’s the latest mega-event to fall prey to the social distancing measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
In a statement, the conference organizers said:
VidCon is dedicated to delivering premium entertainment experiences across the globe. Our first priority is the safety and health of our attendees, sponsors, speakers, creators, and staff. Due to the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the precautions being taken by authorities worldwide to manage this pandemic, we have come to the difficult decision to cancel the 11th annual VidCon in Anaheim this June. All tickets and pre-ordered merch that have been purchased for the June 17 20, 2020 event will be refunded in full by April 15, 2020. This will include all fees for previously canceled tickets.
VidCon is one of the most important events for the massive entertainment industry that’s grown up around the streaming platforms. Those platforms — specifically YouTube and Instagram — raked in a bit over $35 billion in spending in 2019, or roughly half of the ad haul that television advertising pulled in for the same year.
More than just a chance for entertainers to promote themselves and their products, the event is a critical window into where social media is heading.
In its own way, the event is as important to the streaming community as upfronts are to traditional media, or newfronts are to online media.
The (entirely appropriate) response to the COVID-19 outbreak is one that’s been echoed in industries as disparate as entertainment, technology, and auto manufacturing. Most of the big auto shows have been canceled this year, along with the major developer events from Alphabet subsidiary Google and Facebook. Other events are going remote or turning to virtual only — like Apple’s big developer and product event later this year."

The government is putting a stamp of approval on the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) project but remains cautious about what to expect from an app.
Using mobile apps to track the coronavirus is a sensitive issue in Europe. Dozens of nonprofit organizations have written a common statement urging governments to respect human rights.
They fear that governments could use this opportunity to enforce far-reaching surveillance measures that dont comply with the regulatory framework and that remain in place after the coronavirus crisis. The European Commission reminded governments that they should implement appropriate safeguards as EU citizens are not going to trust contact-tracing apps if they don’t treat personal information appropriately.
Thats probably why the government is preventively trying to reassure people before releasing the Stop Covid app. According to a statement, the Ministry for the Digital Sector says that it is working with the Health Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation to coordinate tech-based initiatives.
Led by Germanys Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute for telecoms (HHI), the PEPP-PT project that was unveiled last week is a coalition of dozens of research institutions across multiple countries. Frances INRIA is a member of the PEPP-PT and the French government is willing to collaborate with the INRIA as part of the PEPP-PT effort.
Theyre working on an open standard to develop contact-tracing apps. Those apps would rely on Bluetooth Low Energy to identify other phones running the same app. If, at some point, you are near an infected person, you would be notified.
And the French government says that there will be an app specifically designed to track people living in France. That app will leverage the PEPP-PT protocol.
People in favor of contact-tracing apps say that it would help break infection chains if you combine those apps with proactive tests and self-isolations.
In an interview with Le Monde, Cédric O and Olivier Véran detailed the effort. France isnt going to force you to install the app and Stop Covid is only going to use Bluetooth. A prototype is in the works, but its going to take three to six weeks to develop.
Even then, the French government might not even release the app. Were not sure that we can overcome all the technical difficulties because Bluetooth hasnt been designed to measure the distance between individuals. We will decide later if it would be useful to roll out such an application or not, Cédric O told Le Monde.
When it comes to privacy, Cédric O says the app will be open-source and Frances privacy watchdog the CNIL will have a say. Weve reached out to the CNIL for comment but the agency said it was too early to comment.
More importantly, details are still thin on the implementation of the PEPP-PT protocol in France. Privacy experts are debating the design of the system. Some argue that it should be as decentralized as possible. Smartphones should keep a log of your social interactions (via ephemeral Bluetooth identifiers). Your phone would regularly fetch a list of infected ephemeral Bluetooth identifiers and do the heavy lifting.
The PEPP-PT project currently supports centralized and decentralized approaches, which means that governments have to decide on an implementation. In a centralized system, a server would assign each user an anonymized identifier and collect data about your social interactions. Each user would be able to fetch the status of its identifier to check whether theyve been potentially infected or not. It creates a single point of failure and presents risks if someone is able to match anonymized identifiers with real names.
The Ministry for the Digital Sector also detailed how France is leveraging tech in general to understand the coronavirus outbreak, improve COVID-19 treatments and plan the end of the lockdown in France.
In addition to the app that is currently in the works, the French government has rolled out an official website to inform people, is encouraging telemedicine services to treat patients (such as Covidom from public hospitals in Paris), is mining aggregated data from telecom companies to understand how people move around the country and is leveraging machine learning on big data to forecast the coronavirus outbreak."

Its been a tough couple of years for new social startups but when something hits in this space, it hits big! Were always spending time looking at consumer social we have a network of 200+ college scouts at campuses around the country, so we hear about (and try) new apps pretty frequently.
It is difficult for new social startups to reach any kind of meaningful scale. The average person doesnt download any apps in a given month, and even though younger users may be more willing to try new things, they often face storage or data constraints.
We feel that the market is probably appropriately heated. Once a social startup is working, it shouldnt struggle to raise capital, but there are probably fewer investors making large pre-launch social bets because there have been so few breakout hits recently.

Rt.live is an up-to-date tracker of how fast COVID-19 is spreading in each state.
“Rt” measures the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. The higher above the number 1, the faster COVID-19 races through a population, while a number below one shows the virus receding. For example, Rt.live displays that Georgia has the highest, most dangerous Rt score of 1.5 while New York is down to 0.54 thanks to aggressive shelter-in-place orders.
Krieger tells me that “Kevin has been writing and publishing open-source data analysis notebooks on how to calculate Rt on a daily basis. We wanted to take that work and visualize it so anyone can see how their state is doing at curbing the spread.” Krieger had meanwhile been pitching in by building SaveOurFaves, a directory of local Bay Area restaurants that are selling gift cards so patrons can keep them afloat during quarantine. Built with his wife, the Kriegers open sourced it so people can build similar sites for their communities.
Rt.live shows that as of yesterday, Texas and California are at or just under 1 and Vermont has the best score at 0.33. The charts over time reveal how Washington and Georgia were successfully fighting COVID-19, dipping beneath 1 until the virus bounced back recently. Data is sourced from the COVID Tracking Project and you can examine Rt.live’s modeling system on GitHub.
“As states decide whether and how to open back up, they’ll have to manage their infection rate carefully, and we hope dashboards like rt.live will be helpful in doing so” Krieger says. By better illustrating how even small differences in shelter-in-place policy and compliance can exponentially change the severity of the impact of the virus, it could help convince people to stay inside. This kind of tool could also be helpful for determining where it’d be safe to reactivate some businesses, and quickly catch if virality is spiking and strict social distancing needs to be reinstated.
One fascinating feature of the site is the ability to filter by region so you can see how the Western states are doing better at suppressing COVID-19 than those in the South. You can also view the states with no shelter-in-place orders to see they’re doing worse on average. The charts could help identify how different political orientations and their subsequent policies translate to infection outcomes.
It might seem out of character for the photo app moguls to be building a medical statistics site. But Systrom has long studied virality as part of his work that helped Instagram grow so fast. He began publishing his own statistical models for tracking coronavirus infections and deaths on March 19th. “We’d been talking about ways of working together and this came out of that my first job out of school was actually doing data visualizations / analysis at Meebo so a blast from the past in more ways than one” Krieger tells me. While Systrom did the data analysis, Krieger built the site, mirroring their old front-end and back-end Instagram roles.
“We built Rt.live because we believe Rt the effective infection rate is one of the best ways to understand how COVID is spreading” Kreiger explains. “It was great to work together again we were able to take it from idea to launch in just a few days because of all our history &amp; shared context.”"

The company said it would ban tweets that perpetuate fake cures, deny expert guidance or spread information that could incite panic. It is rushing to verify more health experts, and it has pledged specifically to remove conspiracies linking 5G and coronavirus. But as social media platforms like Facebook have also discovered, fighting COVID-19 misinformation is not easy, and this new report suggests that Twitter is not doing enough to police “super-spreaders.”
Even with Twitter’s promise to ban promotion of ineffective treatment, these accounts shared false studies claiming that hydroxychloroquine treatment has a 100 percent success rate and endorsements for licorice root and Zinc as virus cures. Some said social distancing was “ineffective,” and Icke posted that the virus was a scam.
According to The Information, Twitter says it has removed more than 2,400 tweets since mid-March. Still, there seems to be a serious misinformation problem.

You can access the functionality by typing ""what to watch"" into Google, and then tapping ""Watchlist"" to add a show or movie to your list. If you ever want to get back, type ""my watchlist"" into Search. You can also find your watchlist through the Collections section of the Google app.
In the same blog post, Google also highlighted some of its previous efforts to help entertain people while they’re forced to stay inside, including its new two-month free Stadia offer."

Apple’s solution lets the contact tracing happen in the background, but the UK’s app has to be woken up every time the device detects another nearby device running the same software, BBC explains.
By choosing the centralized approach, the NHS is aligning more with Australia than some of its EU counterparts. Australia’s app, which was released over the weekend, uses a mix of Bluetooth and stored contact data on both the app and servers. Germany, on the other hand, has switched its stance and is now pursuing a decentralized architecture, as are Austria, Estonia and Switzerland.
So far, the European Commission and the EU’s data protection watchdog support both models but note that the differences aren’t entirely clear, EUobserver reports. In either case, the challenge will be getting enough widespread adoption for the apps to be effective."

In response to workers’ concerns, the company told Wired in a statement that it had capped orders for the safety gear (which goes through the company store) to “thousands” per day. It needed to slow the rate of fulfillment to make sure each order was coming from a real shopper. The problem, though, is that the process appears to be fraught with issues.
There’s no queue, so workers have to check every day for stock — and supplies may only be available for minutes before they run out. The company reportedly hasn’t said much about how to place orders or when, either. The lack of info has led to shoppers relying on unofficial communities to get details."

Privacy activists aren’t happy, to no one’s surprise. Although the app relies on anonymous device identities and stores encrypted records of Bluetooth interactions with other devices, the Internet Freedom Foundation said the app doesn’t meet data protection standards or provide enough transparency for algorithms.

So, instead, my attention is was drawn to Super Nintendo World. Universal Studios’ theme park in Japan tentatively reopened to visitors on June 8th, but over the weekend, we heard its highly anticipated Super Nintendo World section is delayed, indefinitely. NHK reports that the company postponed the Nintendo area’s debut after originally intending to kick things off in late July. Predictably, it’s a precaution against the chances of increasing COVID-19 infection rates. Universal Studios is only allowing park visitors from the surrounding Kansai region and has effectively cut visitor numbers in half.
I’ll put my Mario cap back into storage, ready for when I can make the trip and the park has opened.

This year's iPhones might not include a charger in the box
It may be for cost-cutting and environmental reasons.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who’s been correct pretty often in the past, claims that 2020 iPhone models will not only skimp on the usual headphones but won’t include the power adapter either — you may get just a charging cable. There would be a more powerful 20W charger (versus the 18W for the iPhone 11 Pro) made available, but you’d have to buy it after the fact.
Kuo believes this would be a way to cut costs and offset the higher price of 5G wireless technology. There would also be an eco-friendly hook. Environmental critics have argued that including power adapters is frequently a waste when many people have chargers from previous phones or will top up using their computers. I’ll admit to having too many (pretty useless) low-watt phone chargers — so this sounds like a good idea. Continue reading.
Blackpink breaks YouTube's 24-hour viewing record
It comes over a year after BTS set the bar.
K-pop lynchpin BTS’ YouTube viewership record has been broken over a year later. Variety reports that K-pop band Blackpink managed to break the record for the most views in 24 hours, racking up 82.4 million views for its new “How You Like That” music video versus BTS’ 74.6 million for “Boy With Luv.” It might also be the fastest video to reach 100 million views — it claimed 94 million watches in just 30 hours.

OnePlus’ incoming affordable phone may feature dual selfie cameras
Back to fundamentals.
When OnePlus entered the smartphone scene back in 2014, the company’s phones were some of the best value phones you could buy for a while. But that changed slowly — mostly with regard to prices, which have crept up each year. And now, the $899 OnePlus 8 Pro is only $100 less than the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20.
OnePlus is apparently going back to its roots, with a new, more affordable phone series. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said the company plans to introduce a new line initially in India and Europe before bringing it to North America. Spec-wise, rumors suggest a 32-megapixel main sensor and an 8-megapixel secondary sensor supporting a wide-angle lens. The Nord will house the cameras in a display cutout at the top-left corner of the screen. Dual front-facing cameras would be a first for OnePlus, mid-priced phone or not. Continue reading.

In recent years, the application of telehealth had rapidly expanded to address specific chronic and behavioral health issues like mental health, weight loss and nutrition, addiction, diabetes and hypertension, etc. These are real and oftentimes very severe issues faced by people all over the world, yet until now have seen little to no use of technology in providing care.
We believe behavioral health is particularly suited to benefit from the digitization trends COVID-19 has accelerated. Previously, weve written about the pandemic’s impact on online learning and education, both for K-12 students and adult learners. But behavioral health is another area impacted by the fundamental change in consumers behavior today. Below are four reasons we think the time is now for behavioral health startups — followed by five key factors we think characterize successful companies in this area.
Telehealth can significantly lower the cost of care
Traditional behavioral healthcare is cost-prohibitive for most people. In-person therapy costs $100+ per session in the U.S., and many mental health and substance-use providers dont accept insurance because they dont get paid enough by insurers.
By contrast, telehealth reduces overhead costs and scales more effectively. Leveraging technology, providers can treat more patients in less time with almost zero marginal costs. Mobile-based communications enable asynchronous care that further helps providers scale. Access to digital content gives patients on-going support without the need for a human on the other side. This is particularly useful in treating behavioral health issues where ongoing support and motivation may be necessary.
Technology unlocks supply in “shadow markets” of providers
Globally, we face an extreme shortage of behavioral health providers. For example, the United States has fewer than 30,000 licensed psychiatrists (translating to &lt;1 for every 10,000 people). Outside of big cities, the problem gets worse: ~50-60% of nonmetro counties have no psychologists or psychiatrists at all.
Even when providers are available, wait times for appointments are notoriously long. This is a huge issue when behavioral health conditions often require timely intervention.
We are seeing new platforms build large networks of certified coaches, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists, and other providers, aggregating supply in what has historically been a scarce and a highly fragmented provider population.
Behavioral/mental health issues are losing their stigma
We believe the stigma associated with mental illness and other behavioral health conditions is dissipating. More and more public figures are speaking out about their struggle with anxiety, depression, addiction and other behavioral health issues. Our zeitgeist is shifting fast, and theres an all-time high in people seeking help as the Google Trends data below demonstrates.

Instead, the NHS’s technology group NHSX chose a centralized model, in which a list of contacts made via Bluetooth signals will be stored on users’ devices as anonymous tokens. If a user has symptoms or tests positive, the contacts can be submitted to the app, which analyzes the data and sends notifications if necessary.
While critics say the centralized approach raises privacy concerns, NHSX CEO Matthew Gould told Reuters that the group “put privacy right at the heart” of the app. He explained that the app doesn’t know who users are, where they are or who they’ve been near. Britain’s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham pointed out that the centralized approach will allow the UK to gather more insights into the virus, something a decentralized approach might limit.
Just yesterday, France announced that it will begin testing its COVID-19 tracking app beginning May 11th, and Australia has already launched its own version. In the US, a group of senators is working on a bill that would set requirements for data collection and transparency in COVID-19 tracking apps, and Apple and Google have outlined how public health authorities around the world can use their upcoming tracking system to preserve user privacy."

The company saw slumps in hardware sales almost across the board, but it reported a total of $58.3 billion in revenue -- just edging out its performance this time last year.
“Despite COVID-19’s unprecedented global impact, we’re proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter,” CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. 
Today’s results didn’t come out of the blue. Earlier this year, Apple confirmed to its shareholders that it would not meet its previous revenue guidance of between $63 billion and $67 billion because of a “slower return to normal conditions” than the company had anticipated. Cook noted today that, before the coronavirus had begun to reach massive proportions, Apple was expecting a highly successful quarter with revenue near the top of its guidance.
In this past quarter, Apple has continued with its work as best as possible and pushed forward with new product releases, including updated versions of the iPad Pro and MacBook Air. Those devices were released too late to have a significant impact on these results, though. Despite raking in $4.37 billion from its iPad business and $5.35 billion off Mac sales, the company still fell short of the watermark it set this time last year. Since it accounts for the majority of Apple's business, it's little surprise Apple's iPhone business took the brunt of the damage -- sales fell from $31 billion in the year-ago quarter to $28.9 billion this time. Apple didn't elaborate on the cause of this dramatic dip in its initial release, but soft sales in China and coronavirus-related production delays likely contributed to the situation. 
Despite these sales slumps, Apple did report a few successes in this quarter. The company's services business -- which has quickly become one of Apple's most crucial growth areas -- made all-time high $13.3 billion. Sales in Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories category surged slightly, too, generating $6.3 billion for the company. 
For now at least, Apple seems to be holding everything together quite well, but there's one important thing to remember: This is the last quarter on the books that wasn't completely influenced by the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. (Apple's Q2 started at the beginning of January 2020, before the coronavirus situation began to spiral.) As a result, the big changes we've all had to grapple with will be more fully reflected in the company's next earnings release. For instance, Apple closed all of its stores outside Greater China on March 13th, two weeks before the end of Q2. The effects of that decision will likely have a huge impact on Apple's next batch of financials, as will the new iPhone SE, which seems well-positioned to help Apple gain ground with value-minded consumers. For now, we'll have to see how things play out; Apple will certainly face questions about the future of its supply chains, production capability and new hardware development during its customary earnings call, and we’ll update this story with any notable tidbits."

The features went live today and are meant to give consumers more information that will help them and staff stay healthy, Yelp said in an email.
Since late March, Yelp business pages have featured a COVID-19 banner in which businesses can communicate whether they’re temporarily closed, if they’ve adjusted their hours and how they’re operating. Now, the banner has been expanded to the “COVID-19 business updates section,” allowing businesses to share significantly more information. A business can post any updates to service, such as if it’s offering dine-in service, curbside pickup, or both. Businesses can also use the banner to inform customers of any safety measures they’re enacting, such as “enforcing social distancing, sanitizing between customers, mandating staff wear masks and/or gloves, providing hand sanitizer or contactless payment, and more.”"

We’ve asked Amazon for comment. In a statement to CNBC, it maintained that it followed all national and local health guidelines, including the CDC’s contact tracing approach. The firm reviews camera footage, checks where people were present and conducts interviews, according to a spokesperson. It also insisted that it immediately alerts all workers if there’s a positive case, and that it was up to employees to disclose if they tested positive.
Critics have already contended that Amazon’s approach isn’t enough, though, and doesn’t meet CDC guidelines despite claims to the contrary. Warehouse footage only covers 24 hours (not the 48 hours needed for CDC tracing) and likely doesn’t include high-contact areas like washrooms. It would also break CDC guidelines if it discouraged staff from revealing positive test results. As in the past, then, there appears to be a gap between what Amazon says it’s doing to protect workers and what people say is happening."

To predict the outcome of the 2020 MLB season, Unanimous recruited 40 fans from around the country. “We captured their knowledge, wisdom, insight and intuition, in real time,” Rosenberg explained, “and allowed them to converge on these forecasts.” Those forecasts were then fine tuned using historical matchups and stats. 
Unanimous’ baseball predictions last year were accurate roughly 59 percent of the time, a significant advantage over the 55 percent success rate that professional handicappers typically achieve against the Vegas bookmakers. “So far this year in other sports we've been doing we've been over 60 percent accurate,” Rosenberg noted. “So, we’re really happy with how the system is getting even more accurate.”
The wrinkle for this year, however, is that the season is only 60 games long, rather than the standard 162. “It's hard to know if that'll help us or hurt us,” Rosenberg conceded. ”Vegas will probably struggle a little bit more than usual this year because they base their forecasts so much on pure mathematical models and previous years of baseball. Whereas our technology does use historical data but it's also capturing a real time sentiment, the knowledge and wisdom and insight of people.”
As such, Unanimous AI expects the Dodgers, Yankees, Twins and Astros to all win their respective divisions by wide margins, though it will be interesting to see how the Astros manage to pull that feat off without the stadium’s crowd noise to cover up the sound of their trash cans banging. The National League East and Central divisions are much more competitive, with the Nationals and Cardinals expected to narrowly beat out their respective challengers. 
Similarly, the company believes that the Dodgers will win the National league pennant and make it to their third World Series in four years. The Yankees have a similar advantage in the American League, though Atlanta, Minnesota, Houston, Oakland and Tampa Bay all appear in position to give New York a run for its money.
Should these predictions hold true, Unanimous’ AI predicts the Dodgers and Yankees will meet up for their 12th World Series faceoff. The Yanks have a chance to win it all for the first time since 2009 while the Dodgers might finally get to take home some hardware on their seventh try. That said, Unanimous did bet on the Astros winning out last year, just before the Nats caught fire and roundly pounded Houston over the course of sixty-three soul-cleansing innings."

But as the US hunkers down to limit the spread of Covid-19, cybersecurity measures presents a difficult technical challenge to working remotely for employees at critical infrastructure, intelligence agencies, and anywhere else with high-security networks. In some cases, working from home isn't an option at all.
Companies with especially sensitive data or operations often limit remote connections, segment networks to limit a hacker's access if they do get in, and sometimes even disconnect their most important machines from the internet altogether. Late last week, the US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an advisory to critical infrastructure companies to prepare for remote work scenarios as Covid-19 spreads. That means checking that their virtual private networks are patched, implementing multi-factor authentication, and testing out remote access scenarios.
But cybersecurity consultants who actually work with those high-stakes clientsincluding electric utilities, oil and gas firms, and manufacturing companiessay that it's not always so simple. For many of their most critical customers, and even more so for intelligence agencies, remote work and security don't mix.
""Organizations are realizing that work-from-home would be very difficult to execute,"" says Joe Slowik, who previously led the computer emergency response team at the Department of Energy before joining the critical-infrastructure-focused security firm Dragos. ""This should be a fairly good wake-up call. You need to figure out a way that if individuals cannot physically access the control system environment for a service that cannot stop, like electricity, water, and wastewater or similar services, you ensure continuous operationeven in the face of an environment where you might be risking your employees' lives if they continue to commute into the office.""
""Administrators are bumping each other off as they try to work and log in.""
Jake Williams, Rendition InfoSec
For many industrial networks, the highest standard of security is an ""air gap,"" a physical disconnect between the inner sanctum of software connected to physical equipment and the less sensitive, internet-connected IT systems. But very few private-sector firms, with the exception of highly regulated nuclear power utilities, have implemented actual air gaps. Many companies have instead attempted to restrict the connections between their IT networks and their so-called OT or operational technology networksthe industrial control systems where the compromise of digital computers could have dangerous effects, such as giving hackers access to an electric utility's circuit breakers or a manufacturing floor's robots.
Those restricted connections create chokepoints for hackers, but also for remote workers. Rendition InfoSec founder and security consultant Jake Williams describes one manufacturing client that carefully separated its IT and OT systems. Only ""jump boxes,"" servers that bridge the divide between sensitive manufacturing control systems and non-sensitive IT systems, connected them. Those jump boxes run very limited software to prevent them from serving as in-roads for hackers. But they also only support one connection at a time, which means the company's IT administrators have found themselves vying for access.
""Administrators are bumping each other off as they try to work and log in,"" says Williams. ""These jump boxes that were built to facilitate secure remote access in emergency situations weren't built to support this situation where everyone is performing routine maintenance and operations remotely.""
For the most critical of critical infrastructure, however, like power plants and oil refineries, remote work isn't just leading to technical snafus. It's often impossible for many staffers, says Chris Sistrunk, a security consultant for FireEye who formerly worked as an electrical engineer for power utility Entergy. ""There's no way to fully remotely run some of those plants,"" Sistrunk says. ""You don't work from home. Essential engineers and operators will always be there 24/7.""
In those scenarios, Dragos' Slowik says, companies have to instead try to limit the biological exposure of their most critical operations teams to prevent them from being quarantinedwhich is often easier said than done, given that they're free to mingle with potentially infected people during their off-hours. ""It's a real touchy subject,"" says Slowik. ""You need them available at the office, and you can only restrict them to a certain extentbecause we're not Chinaso how does that balance out?"""

With the launches of Apple TV+ and Disney+and amidst the continued production of huge slates of content from behemoths like Netflix and Amazonstreaming services, taken as a whole, became a massive source of cultural output. No one ever expected theyd soon become the only source of it. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic spreads and social distancing becomes essential (please everyone, stay home if you can), streaming may become, for the foreseeable future, the main site of collective cultural experience. Schools are closing; movie theaters and performing arts spaces are shutting their doors; sports are on hold. Suddenly, the large libraries of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Apple, Disney+, Spotify, and so on, are the nexus of humanitys artistic consumption as everyone attempts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in their communities.
The effect of this on the entertainment industry so far is two-fold. On one hand, movie multiplexes, concert halls, Broadway theaters, and other venues are rapidly closing, impacting the revenues of those industries. On the other, the coronavirus outbreak has left people home-bound, with little else to do but binge-watch (and, OK, read; reading is good). Hollywood in particular began seeing the effects of the virus months ago; quarantines and lockdowns in Asia forced people to stay in their homes and away from movie theaters. Here in the United States, studios began postponing their big tentpole releases in the last two weeks; No Time to Die was pushed to November, and Mulan, A Quiet Place Part II, and F9 soon followed suit. (The Hunt, this generations most-cursed film, opened this weekend after its controversial political premise pushed it away from theaters in September.) Some projections show that Hollywood is on track to lose some $20 billion (an estimate thats likely to increase the longer lockdowns continue), and while studios like NBCUniversal are making the move to release some of their movies digitally at the same time they hit the theaters that remain open, that still wont recoup a ton of fundseven if it does give people more options for isolation viewing.
Thats not to say, however, there arent already plenty of options on streaming. But as those of us who started social distancing days ago may have discovered, theres so much to watch that its difficult to decide what to put on. For the first time in a long time, if ever, there is no big eventno marquee movie release, no TV premiere, no athletic championship or awards showthat can unite people, aside from perhaps watching the news. And while Disney+ has added Frozen 2 to its lineup three months early (it was previously only available for rental and purchase on various services), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is also available for purchase early ahead of its March 31 home video launch, neither are the kind of offering that will steer the conversation away from anything other than Covid-19even if that talking is limited to social media. If anything, the coronavirus crisis has made streaming services more necessary than ever, while also proving how ineffective they can be at shared cultural moments.

Is it possible there will be some big surprises in the next few weeks, some entertainment bailout for the bored masses eager to be told what to watch? Maybe. (We certainly wouldnt be upset if Beyoncé were to drop a new visual album out of nowhere.) But until then, folks are stuck choosing their own entertainment. Beyond maybe the suddenly relevant Contagion, no one seems to be watching the same thing. The result only adds to everyones social isolation. Folks are all doing their best to stay connected to one anotherpeople are watching each other play videogames on Twitch, teens are creating corona-content on TikTok, and your friends are all suddenly going live on Instagrambut few of those things replicate going to a concert or seeing the new Star Wars movie on opening night."

As we reported April 3, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends all citizens voluntarily wear a cloth face mask for essential trips out of the house to the grocery store, doctor, or other public places where the 6-foot social distancing rules may be difficult to maintain. In short, most places.
Wearing a cloth mask might help protect people around you, if you happen to be infected with Covid-19 but do not have symptoms yet (these are Covid-19's typical symptoms). Some individuals infected with Covid-19 never show symptoms, or do not get very sick, especially if they are young. Basically, these masks mainly help others, not youthough if used properly, a cloth mask may help you avoid touching your face and infecting yourself while out of the house.
Be sure to frequently wash masks in the washing machine with regular detergent.
Whether you are wearing a face covering or not, the CDC still recommends that you:
<ul><li>Wash your hands regularly. Use soap and water, and wash them for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizer is acceptable to use if you are unable to wash your hands.
</li><li>Cover your face when coughing with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.
</li><li>Avoid touching your face, because you could transmit the virus from your hands into your mouth.
</li><li>Stay at home, except for essential trips outside like trips to the grocery store or to see your doctor. This is also called sheltering in place.
</li><li>Practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from other people. The White House also recommends avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, which should be easy because you're staying at home.
</li><li>Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces daily (here's our Covid-19 cleaning guide).
</li></ul>Some Mask Rules:
<ul><li>Do not buy and hoard medical masks. Health care professionals are already facing a devastating shortage in supplies, and we should not use protective masks that ill patients and health care workers may need.
</li><li>Do not put a face mask on kids under 2 years oldor anyone who has difficulty breathing or might be unable to remove the mask themselves.
</li><li>Do not remove a mask by its mouth area. Grab it by the straps. Wash your hands after touching it.
</li><li>Do not just wear a standard bandana or scarf. Follow the instructions below to create a mask that has multiple layers and more tightly covers your face.

Now the federal government is asking for even more.,https://www.wired.com/story/ventilator-makers-race-to-prevent-a-possible-shortage/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e715ffda87ec30009860e6b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_ventilator_1206950101.jpg",2020-03-18T22:01:59Z,"Eric Gjerde, CEO of Airon Corporation, a small ventilator maker in Gainesville, Florida, has been getting far more business than hed like in recent weeks. An Italian company asked him for 2,000 machines. His distributor in California, working with state officials there, asked for 500 more. Normally, his company sells 50 in a good month, Gjerde says, and they only keep so many parts on hand. He told the Italians no, and he told the Californians hed do his best. America has to come first, he says. 
On Monday, the California distributor came back to him: Could he send another 200? Of course they want them today, and you just cant do that, Gjerde says. Making ventilators is not a trivial process. But again, he said hed do what he could.
Plus: How can I avoid catching it? Is Covid-19 more deadly than the flu? Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer your questions.
As the number of Covid-19 cases surges, state governments and hospitals are clamoring for more ventilators and facing a dearth of supplies. The machines are a critical component in treating the most severe cases of the disease, in which inflammation restricts the amount of oxygen a persons lungs can take up on their own. Ventilators vary widely in cost and size, from portable units used at home and in ambulances to much larger machines found in intensive care units, but their purpose is the same: They force oxygen into the patients lungs, usually through intubation.
Some estimates suggest demand for ventilators may quickly overwhelm US hospitals supply, which includes about 160,000 machines, plus 12,000 more in federal reserves, according to a recent tally by Johns Hopkins researchers. Not all of those machines are suited to critical care and, of course, many of them are already in use by people with other respiratory conditions.
Whether the nation will face a shortage depends on whether social distancing measures can flatten the curve, reducing the number of people who need hospitalization at the same time, says Craig Coopersmith, director of critical care at Emory University School of Medicine. Right now were OK, but there will be shortages if the pandemic becomes severe enough, he says. For a preview, doctors need only look to the hardest-hit parts of Italy and China.
Days after telling governors to fend for themselves in obtaining critical supplies like ventilators, President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced he would invoke the Defense Production Act to ramp up the manufacture of critical supplies, including ventilators. Passed in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, the act allows the federal government to step in to ensure the steady flow of goods, including military weapons but also food and health supplies.
On Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper also announced that his agency would distribute 2,000 ventilators from their own reserve to the Department of Health and Human Services, but noted that these machines are different from ones normally used in civilian settings and would require special training from defense personnel.
Its unclear what the immediate effect of Trumps announcement will be, although it will allow federal agencies to order needed supplies from manufacturers. The question is whether new machines can be produced quickly enough. The problem I have is that people have been seeing this coming for a long time and governments and hospitals just have not stockpiled, Gjerde says. These can sit in a box and never be touched. For now, hes had to say no to international orders, despite having distributors in Taiwan and Italy beg him for more.
Retooling a complex supply chain to build more machines quickly will be difficult. Airon relies on suppliers across the Midwest to make the valves and tubing, while another supplier in Washington makes each machines casing. A few parts come from China. Gjerdes looking into whether he can get the circuit boards he needs produced locally.
More top-down coordination could potentially help, says Chris Brooks, COO of Ventec, a ventilator maker based near Seattle. The company, which typically ships 100 machines per month, has seen immediate demand for thousands of machines. Our hope is that we dont need as many ventilators as people are saying, he says.
In the United Kingdom, the British government is pushing for large manufacturers to switch from making cars and airplane engines to ventilator equipment. But Gjerde says that even the best engineering teams that are not used to making medical machinery will find it hard to reorient quickly. They dont know the nature of the beast, says Gjerde, whos received an offer of aid from an auto parts manufacturer in Canada. For certain components, it might be feasible, he says, but its just too dangerous to be thrown into the hands of people who dont know what theyre doing.
In the meantime, some have taken to creative hacks, like open-sourcing schematics for the design of ventilator parts for 3D printing. In Italy, the approach was used to quickly produce much-needed valve replacements, reportedly over the objections of a ventilator manufacturer that threatened a patent lawsuit. On Twitter, ER doctors have traded tips on how to split ventilator tubes between multiple people.
Those solutions arent ideal. Methods like splitting tubes come with concerns about the proper calibration of machines that must now feed oxygen to several users with potentially different needs, and will likely result in patients sharing pathogens. Ultimately, well have to figure out whats actually practical, Coopersmith says. Those methods could be used in a pinch in remote areas, he says, or if the situation gets bad enough that neighboring hospitals are no longer in a position to share resources. This is different from anything Ive seen in my lifetime, he says.

In the meantime, medical professionals should be preparing for difficult choices, says Govind Persad, a bioethicist at the University of Denver who studies how to allocate scarce medical resources. I think people are being very hopeful if they think were not going to see shortages, he says. An important step would be to have guidance from governments and medical associations that covers which patients to prioritize for life-saving measures like ventilator access. He points to guidance from New York State and Australia on rationing critical resources so that decisions are made more fairly. Otherwise, hospitals risk falling into a first-come, first-served stance that doesnt prioritize patients by their level of need. Once someone is on a ventilator, its incredibly hard to take them off, he says."

Truth be told, I am spending more time in Westeros than in the real world, writing every day, he wrote Tuesday on his personal blog. Things are pretty grim in the Seven Kingdoms but maybe not as grim as they may become here.
Does this mean fans may finally see Winds of Winter, the sixth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series? Maybe! Folks have been waiting for the novel for nearly a decade (the last book in the series, A Dance with Dragons, came out in 2011), but Martin has also promised the book many times before and not delivered. Meanwhile, the HBO show wrapped up last year with a less-than-stellarconclusion.
As for Martin, he says that when hes not writing hes taking care of himself in New Mexico. For those of you who may be concerned for me personally, he wrote. Yes, I am aware that I am very much in the most vulnerable population, given my age and physical condition. But I feel fine at the moment, and we are taking all sensible precautions.

More Covid-19-related news. Sort of. Variety reports that Warner Bros. will be releasing the Suicide Squad spinoff movie Birds of Prey to video-on-demand on March 24, much earlier than expected. The move is unprecedented considering the film is still in some theaters, but with movie houses closing and people social distancing at home, VOD might be the only way WB can make the movie available to many fans.

You cant, for instance, diagnose yourself with Covid-19 by holding your breath for 10 seconds to see if you cough. Coronavirus does affect the lungs, and indeed this is one way it kills patients. But simply holding your breath cant tell you if the virus is affecting your lungs. Of course, the only true way of knowing if you have Covid-19 is to get a test for the disease, Yasmin says.

He went from a blame-China-not-me strategy to a blame-China-and-the-World-Health-Organization-not-me strategy. 
Officials at WHO, Trump said at a press conference, are very biased toward Chinajust look at how, in the early weeks of the outbreak, they said theres no big deal, theres no big problem, theres nothing. So Trump will be looking into whether to freeze US funding for WHO.
Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida is on board. A week before Trumps press conference, he called for hearings into WHOs performance. The World Health Organization, Scott says, lied to us. It was intentional. People are dying because of it. So, as soon as Congress is back in session, there should be a hearing, along with a full investigation, to review whether American taxpayers should continue to spend millions of dollars every year to fund an organization that willfully parroted propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party.
This is a familiar right-wing move: subject international institutions to scrutiny that, if all goes according to plan, can be used to justify cutting their funding. Then, as the script typically unfolds, global governance fans like me spring to the defense of these institutions.
In this case, though, Im partly in sync with the right-wing move. I dont agree with Scott that we should do the investigation ASAP (since at the moment both we and the World Health Organization are kind of, um, busy). And Im not in favor of cutting WHO funding. Im also not nearly as sure as Scott that WHO is guilty as charged. But the organization could have performed better in the early stages of the contagion, and theres at least some reason to suspect that people at WHO knowingly and consequentially misled us.
Before I get into the consequential misleading, let me lay out a larger reason that I think fellow global governance fans should consider getting on the investigate-WHO bandwagon.
Institutions of international governance, like institutions of national governance, are prone to a particular form of corruption: theyre inclined to serve powerful interests at the expense of their mission.
For example: Back in 2002, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsthe international body that monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Conventionwas doing something that John Bolton, then in George W. Bushs state department, found annoying. OPCWs director, Jose Bustani, was trying to get Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which would have subjected the country to immediate OPCW inspections. As Bustani noted years later, these inspections might have made it obvious there were no weapons to destroy. This would completely nullify the decision to invade.
The Bush Administration used its clout to force Bustani out of office. He was replaced by an OPCW director less inclined to disobey America. Problem solved: Aversion of disastrous war averted.
I suspect that if Rick Scott had been a senator back then, and had been apprised of the Bush administrations intervention, he would have been less outraged than he is now by the thought of an international institution betraying its mission under pressure from a powerful nation. But if youre someone who genuinely wants global governance to flourish, it shouldnt matter which nation is exerting the pressure or what particular mission is being corrupted. You should want international institutions to function with integrity and efficiency and you should want to expose them when they fail. You should want to unearth problems at both OPCW and WHO.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Which brings us back to the question of misconduct by the World Health Organization. The basic allegation is that China tried to cover up the Covid-19 outbreak, and WHO helped it do that.
The most damning piece of evidence is a WHO tweet on Jan. 14 reporting that preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. This came 18 days after a group of doctors notified Wuhan health officials of a disturbing cluster of illnesses, and 14 days after both Chinas national government and WHO were officially notified. Is it really plausible that officials in Beijing or at WHO still doubted that the illness was moving from person to person?
If you wanted to make the case for plausibility, heres what you would say:
The New York Times has reported that, starting in December, local health officials in Wuhan, out of a political aversion to sharing bad news, withheld information about cases from the national reporting systemkeeping Beijing in the dark and delaying the response. And even after Beijing got involved, local officials set narrow criteria for confirming cases, leaving out information that could have provided clues that the virus was spreading among humans. In particular, hospitals were ordered to count only patients with a known connection to the source of the outbreak, the now-infamous wet market. So every patient being counted could in theory have gotten the virus directly from food sold there. Indeed, the first death, reported three days before the WHO tweet, involved a patient who had been to the market."

But remote doctors can't diagnose or treat illness.,https://www.wired.com/story/telemedicine-safety-valve-strained-health-care-system/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e696087610c6100088f8dc0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Biz-medicalsupplies-624592974.jpg",2020-03-14T12:00:00Z,"Weve seen about a 30 percent increase compared with December, said James Wantuck, physician and cofounder of Plushcare, a health care platform offering virtual visits and online screening. So, the volume is increasing a lot, but its a very small percentage of those people today that were actually worried are infected with [coronavirus], on the order of about 1 percent.
Patients in waiting rooms arent the only ones at risk. Hospitals across the country report mask shortages. Hospital staff and TSA workers have tested positive after coming into contact with patients.
Limiting hospital admittance to those who are at higher risk of being infected is essential if we are to flatten the curve of the viruss spread. If too many people are referred to treatment, hospitals waste valuable resources and risk workers health; not enough, and those with untreated infections spread the virus to countless others.
For now, the CDC prioritizes testing those who meet specific criteria: recent travel to level 3 affected areas like China, Iran, or South Korea; ongoing severe symptoms like fever, coughing, and shortness of breath; and patients with pre-existing conditions: diabetes, lung disease, or those taking immunosuppressants. Health officials say the lack of readily available testing means the reported number of infected in the US, more than 1,700, is deceptively low.
No one has high blood pressure if you don't have blood pressure cuffs, said Dr. Caesar Djavaherian, a San Francisco physician and co-founder of Carbon Health, another healthcare platform which also saw a recent spike in telehealth requests. As soon as you have [them], you notice that a lot of people have high blood pressure. That's what happened this week. Next week, it'll happen to a much larger extent.
Plus: How can I avoid catching it? Is Covid-19 more deadly than the flu? Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer your questions.
Generally, telehealth and virtual visit apps begin with an intake form: What are the patients symptoms? How long have they had them? Where have they traveled recently? Depending on the severity of symptoms and whether they live in an outbreak area, users may be referred to a doctor, who will counsel them on visiting a hospital, staying in and monitoring their symptoms, or other steps. Virtual visits are faster than in-person visits, but, importantly, they dont diagnose anything. None of the virtual visit or telehealth apps can conclusively tell a patient whether theyre infected with coronavirus.
We give them advice for follow up, said Dr. Peter Antall, cofounder of American Well, another healthtech platform thats seen an increase in telehealth requests, either definitive follow up, like I need you to be seen within the next 72 hours by your primary care doctor or, conditional follow up, where we say, Hey, this looks fine. Now, if you begin to develop anything like breathing difficulty, deep cough, high fever. I do need you to be seen.
Ryan, who asked not to identify his last name, turned to Reddit last weekend looking for an answer. He had fever, a bad cough, and difficulty breathing. Without a regular doctor, Ryan started calling centers in New York. Health officials made it clear to him they were only recommending the most dire cases for evaluation. Even fewer were likely to get tested for the virus.
Ive called 3 clinics and a hospital and theyve told me that I shouldnt come into the hospital because I dont have severe conditions, he wrote. Instead, officials recommended he download and use the telehealth app for New York Presbyterian Hospital, checking in with a doctor via a virtual visit. Fearing it would be as expensive as an in-person visit, he went to the ER anyway."

This technological fix is happening at the same time as a bubbling medical debate among physicians over whether too many coronavirus patients are being placed on traditional ventilators that some argue may do more harm than good.
A team of UC Berkeley engineering students designed and built a conversion kit to retrofit several thousand sleep apnea machines that have been donated to a volunteer group in the Bay Area called Ventilators SOS. The modified devices are helpful for patients who are improving or have milder symptoms, saving ventilators for severely ill patients who are battling advanced respiratory failure.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
This is a simple device, says Ajay Dharia, a pulmonary specialist at Mills Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame, California, who is helping coordinate the volunteer effort along with medical researchers and technicians at UC Berkeley and UCSF. The type of patient for us to treat is someone with milder disease or people who have been on a ventilator for a long time and are recovering. If someone who has been on a ventilator for 14 days, which is what we are seeing now with many patients, and you can shorten it to 10 days, then someone else can use the ventilator.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Emory University Medical Center in Atlanta are also modifying sleep apnea machines to prepare for an expected shortage of ICU ventilators. Emory is preparing for an April 20 projected peak of coronavirus patients, and is facing a shortage of somewhere between 500 to 1,000 ICU beds in the Atlanta area, according to Chris Martin, a pulmonary care physician at Emory University School of Medicine. While they dont need any extra ventilators right now, they are preparing by converting some sleep apnea machines. We realize that we need to adjust and adapt, Martin says. We have gone through the process to inventory and make sure they are ready and have all the supplies and connectors.
Devices that have already been approved for hospital use, such as anesthesia and sleep apnea machines, dont need extra certification to treat Covid-19 patients, according to an FDA emergency use authorization issued March 24.
There are two types of sleep apnea machines. The bi-level positive airway pressure, or BiPAP, machine pushes oxygen into the lungs of patients through a face mask or nose tube. Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs at a lower pressure level, making it easier for patients to breathe at night. A second kind of device, the constant positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, only has one pressure setting and is less flexible, but is also smaller, cheaper (about $500), and easier to use. In contrast, a mechanical ventilator typically used in a hospital to help patients in respiratory distress uses a flexible tube placed inside the throat to fill the lungs with air and in effect breathe for the patient. It can cost upwards of $50,000.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
As the epidemic has gripped New York, several hundred coronavirus patients are crammed inside Mount Sinais intensive care units, surgical suites, and regular hospital rooms. Tesla founder Elon Musk sent several hundred BiPAP machines to the hospital in late March, and Dr. Hooman Poor, a pulmonary and critical care physician at New Yorks Mount Sinai Medical Center, was part of a team that figured out how to reconfigure them with a few off-the-shelf parts. They added a filter to the exhaust valve so virus particles expelled from the patients lungs dont endanger hospital workers and an alarm system to warn nurses when a patient might be in trouble.
Poor says they havent yet had to deploy modified sleep apnea machines turned ventilators, but just knowing they are ready is a big relief. The one situation that terrifies me is having to make a decision with two patients and one ventilator and having to decide who gets it, says Poor. Having these extra machines reduces the chance I would have to make that decision.
Hospitals in New York, Chicago, and Boston are also repurposing anesthesia gas machines that are normally only used during surgical procedures, according to Mary Dale Peterson, president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists and a pulmonary pediatric physician at Driscoll Childrens Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Peterson says that many hard-hit hospitals are doing the best they can as ventilators run short, but we shouldnt forget that medical workers need to be trained on new machines, or repurposed ones. Under normal conditions, you would want enough time for enough testing and vetting, time to train the staff on how to manage those ventilators, because on every piece of machinery you have to learn where the buttons are, Peterson says. But we are not dealing with ideal conditions. Im hoping we are getting through the crisis without having to resort to things that are totally brand new or havent been tested.
The ventilator shortage has also attracted novel designs that still must get approval from the FDA before being used on patients. A Mississippi doctor built a breathing bag from parts he bought at a local hardware store, while a team of Rice University engineering students designed an automated breathing bag that can be used by first responders or emergency room doctors that can be built with 3D printed parts for about $150."

The cancellation of large gatherings in confined spaces was announced by Health Minister Olivier Veran after special government meetings Saturday that focused on responses to the epidemic.
Having previously recommended that people avoid shaking hands, the minister said they should also cut back on “la bise,” the custom in France and elsewhere in Europe of giving greetings with kisses, or air kisses, on the cheeks.
The tightened restrictions on public gatherings had an immediate impact. A major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors was postponed from March to June.
A half-marathon that was scheduled for Sunday in Paris also was cancelled, as was a carnival in the Alpine town of Annecy, Veran announced.
He said other outdoor events and gatherings that might lead to a mixing of people from infected areas could also be canceled.
Public gatherings are being banned completely in the Oise region north of Paris that has seen a cluster of cases, and in a town in the foothills of the Alps that has also seen infections, he said.
As of Saturday, France had registered a total of 73 people infected with the coronavirus, up from 57 on Friday. Of those, 59 people remain hospitalized, two have died and 12 have recovered, the minister said.

Former intelligence contractor and whistleblower Reality Winner has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. Winners sister, Brittany Winner, tweeted her diagnosis earlier today. Winner is currently incarcerated in a federal medical prison in Fort Worth, Texas, where an outbreak has sickened hundreds of inmates and killed atleast two.
Winner is seeking compassionate release during the coronavirus pandemic, citing underlying medical conditions. An early petition for release from her imprisonment at FMC Carswell was denied in April. Shortly afterward, Carswell reported its first coronavirus death: Andrea Circle Bear, who died after giving birth on a ventilator. The Fort Worth Star-Telegramreported last week that 130 people had contracted COVID-19 at the prison; the most recent Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics show over 500 cases. An appeal is currently pending.

 Brittany Winner, PhD (@WinnerBrittany) July 20, 2020
Winners attorney, Joe Whitley, told Law.comsDaily Report that he hopes the court will take the outbreak into consideration. I hope the BOP is equipped to handle the geometric surge in cases, effectively at all their facilities, but I am concerned that may not be the case. According to Daily Report, Winners sister says she is currently asymptomatic, and one of her cellmates also tested positive.
Prisons have emerged as one of the most dangerous hotspots for Americas coronavirus outbreak. Attorney General William Barr has ordered prisons to prioritize releasing inmates to home confinement, but numerous reports have demonstrated confusion and delays in the process although some high-profile Trump associates, like Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, have been released.
Winner, who previously worked for the National Security Agency, accepted a plea deal for espionage in 2018 after leaking a report on Russian election interference to The Intercept. She is currently scheduled for release in November 2021."

One of the strategies at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, was to have residents report their temperatures daily and isolate at the first sign of fever. The ring could allow users to do the same. But it would require that they hand over medical data, which opens up data privacy concerns.
There is some indication that this could work, though. Thanks to the Oura Ring, a Finnish business executive noticed that his temperature was higher than normal (about 100.4 Fahrenheit) and his heart and breathing rates were slightly increased.

""Moreover, it does not focus on a specific problem in healthcare,"" she added.
The FCC also adopted rules for the Connected Care Pilot Program, a separate, three-year initiative that will provide up to $100 million to help offset the cost of providing virtual care. One goal of the pilot is to determine how the FCC's Universal Service Fund might be used to support long-term telehealth. In particular, that program will emphasize providing care to veterans and low-income Americans.
In light of the coronavirus, Medicare has expanded telehealth coverage nationwide. While Medicare previously covered telehealth in some rural areas, patients still had to go to specially-designated sites for their visits.

The system would send Bluetooth “chirps” of random numbers to nearby phones. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload all their received chirps from the past 14 days (about the maximum incubation time) to help others find out if they were close by. If there’s a match between numbers, the passers-by get notifications telling them of possible contact and what to do next.

People feel better if they see it happening, but its a false sense of security, she says. Its something we should not be doing. She says CDC documents have been inconsistent on the value of temperature screening; the agency did not respond to a request for comment.
A review of 15 years of previous studies on screening at international borders published last year found checks for fevers or other symptoms, such as a cough, were ineffective at detecting cases during SARS, swine flu, and Ebola outbreaks. ECRI, a nonprofit that studies evidence-based medicine, warned last month that infrared temperature screening is ineffective, even when combined with questionnaires.
Studies, including one presented last year by FDA researchers working on pandemic preparedness, have shown that infrared thermometers and cameras can accurately detect fevers. They use sensors that detect the infrared light, invisible to humans, produced by objects;different wavelengths correspond to different temperatures.
Infrared thermometers, sometimes called noncontact thermometers, and often shaped like ray guns, read the temperature of a single spot on a persons skin. They are usually aimed at the forehead from a distance of around 6 inches, requiring uncomfortably close contact during pandemic times. Infrared or thermal cameras, like the one in use at King Hospital, produce color-coded images of a whole scene from several feet away showing the temperature of everything in view.
Schell-Chaple, who has done research on fever and body temperature measurement, says there are questions about how reliably the technology performs in everyday health care, a concern shared by ECRI. Accuracy might be even more challenged outside of a hospital or clinic, like at a factory or church.
People feel better if they see it happening, but its a false sense of security. Its something we should not be doing.
Hildegarde Schell-Chaple, professor of nursing at UC San Francisco
UCSFs screening for staff, patients, and others entering its hospitals uses questionnaires that ask people about their health. Schell-Chaple argues that the money and time required to buy and operate infrared temperature screens might be better directed towards other practices aimed at containing coronavirus. Those include using protective equipment and establishing policies for tracing who may have been exposed to an infected patient.
Demand for remote temperature sensors, especially infrared cameras, appears to be growing fast. Companies like Amazon are being accused of lax safety by employees, media, and lawmakers. Checkpoints with shiny new equipment provide a visible, scientific-looking demonstration that safety is being taken seriously.
FLIR Systems, which manufactures its own thermal cameras and sensors used by other companies, saw spikes in sales during SARS, swine flu, and Ebola. The one prompted by the novel coronavirus is the biggest yet, says Chris Bainter, the companys director for global business development.
In its latest earnings report last week, FLIR said the pandemic had shrunk sales of infrared cameras used on boats, by hunters, and for security, but surging demand for thermal cameras drove revenue 2 percent higher than the same quarter last year. Bainter says the company has prioritized health care providers as it works through a backlog of orders.
The company also sells infrared noncontact thermometers, but it says its FDA-certified cameras, which start at $6,500, are the better option for fever screening. Bainter says the technology can check workers in 10 seconds or less, but that correctly implementing it takes some care and calibration.
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
A thermal camera will produce an alluring image of whatever you point it at, color-coded to show the temperature of different objects. But it cant screen people accurately if they are not properly framed and in focus, Bainter says. FLIR advises that the best readings are obtained from a persons tear ducts, the inside corner of the eyes, an area well-supplied with blood and less likely than the forehead to be made warm by a hat, hood, or sunlight. FLIR cameras designed for medical use have a screening mode, in which the camera flags people significantly warmer than others that day."

Now What?,Epidemiologists aren't surprised that virus was spreading in the US in early February. But those early days offer lessons for how to catch the next wave.,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-was-here-earlier-than-most-americans-thought-now-what/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ea746064e08ae0008803bef/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_covid19_1211415985.jpg",2020-04-28T13:00:00Z,"For the past two months, the earliest known community spread of Covid-19passed between people here in the United States, rather than a traveler bringing it home from abroadwas a case identified at the UC Davis medical center on February 26. Now we have confirmation the virus was circulating here far earlier than that. Last week, health officials in Santa Clara County, California, announced that a 57-year-old woman died of Covid-19 at her home in San Jose on February 6. Two others followed her in mid-February and early March. None of those people had recently traveled abroad. Their diagnoses were all confirmed posthumously from tissue samples taken by the county coroner and sent to the Centers for Disease Control for testing.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
Health officials are likely to turn up more cases like those. Theyre really like iceberg tips, said Sara Cody, the public health officer for Santa Clara County, at a press conference last week. When you have an outcome like death that means theres an iceberg of cases of unknown size.
The findings have underlined the early failures of the USs pandemic response. As federal officials, including President Donald Trump, downplayed the crisis and cast it as a foreign problem, the virus was already here, slipping through border checks and spreading undetected due to a lack of tests. They also left people wondering once again whether they might have already had the disease and hoping they are now immune. (The answer, still, is probably not.)
For scientists who have studied the early spread of Covid-19 in the US, the viruss timeline did not need to be rewritten. Theres nothing even vaguely surprising about this finding, says Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Its easy to be smart in hindsight, but all the evidence we have has pointed to this.
This is in line with our projections, says Kate Coronges, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. Using travel patterns and data about the viruss transmission, a team there recently estimated that tens of thousands of invisible cases were already occurring in US cities prior to March 1. As the new cases confirm, fatalities from the virus were invisible, too, going unexplained or labeled with the wrong cause of death. But even with the new information, their models still point to a likely mid-January introduction in states like California and New York.
Even if the experts expected this result, the new cases highlight some of the challenges of precisely understanding the early stages of the viruss spread in the USa process that could have lessons for containment if the virus roars back later this year after social distancing measures are relaxed. That starts with what researchers have learned about how the virus arrived here in the first place.
Much of what we know about the early spread of Covid-19 has been learned from sleuthing through the viruss genetic code. As a virus spreads, hijacking the cellular machinery of its hosts cells to replicate its RNA, it picks up mutations at a relatively predictable pace. That allows researchers to walk backwards through the viruss evolutionary history, tracing when mutations occur and where the virus splits off into new strains. Researchers have used those genetic techniques to trace the origins of the virus back to strains circulating in China, and to draw various paths that brought it to the US.
In the US, an analysis by Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center, put the viruss introduction at some point in the middle of January. But the virus took multiple routes. Some strains came via travelers arriving directly from China. Other strains, especially on the East Coast, arrived by way of Europe. From there, the various strains began to bounce around the country, as Americans continued to jet about prior to the enactment of shelter-in-place rules."

Come July, it was planning to shut down a congested stretch of Highway 101 between San Francisco and Silicon Valley for nearly three weeks to tear out and rebuild an aging, cracking bridge deck that carries the freeway over San Franciscos Alemany Circle. It anticipated six-mile-long backups and hour-long delaysand thats if it could convince one-third of drivers to skip the trip or at least avoid rush hour. Then, in early March, Covid-19 hit the United States. California issued a shelter-in-place order. And while most residents stayed home, the states Department of Transportation went to work.
With traffic cut in half, the DOT, better known as Caltrans, saw a rare opportunity to tackle the project without devastating the commutes of hundreds of thousands of travelers. Last week, about 100 construction workers got to sawing apart the bridge deck, hauling away the debris, and building a fresh one in its place. Within a week, the crew had laid fresh concrete. Its now on track to finish the project in nine days, half as long as projected and three months early. Caltrans spent more than planned to acquire materials like timber on short notice, but spokesperson Bart Ney says those costs are far outweighed by avoiding a massive, expensive inconvenience for drivers.
By forcing most Americans to stick to their sofas, the novel coronavirus makes it easier to close lanes without creating congestion, creates safer conditions for road workers, and allows for jackhammering and paving day and night. Along with the bridge deck project, Caltrans is accelerating projects repaving stretches of Highway 1 in San Francisco and Highway 101 in Sonoma County, building a series of roundabouts in the city of Napa, and getting ahead of sundry maintenance projects.

Across the country, DOTs are reaping the benefits of fixing road networks without worrying about road users. Reno is speeding an extension of its bus rapid transit network, which involves closing down a chunk of its Virginia Street thoroughfare, saving six weeks of work and up to 35 percent of costs. In Wisconsin and Arizona, crews are taking the opportunity to work during the day as well as at night. Road projects in Texas, Colorado, and Virginia are suddenly ahead of schedule. At the order of Governor Ron DeSantis, the Florida DOT is expediting work on I-4 in Orlando, closing more lanes and working longer hours to finish a connection to State Route 408 up to two months early. In Hawaii, construction consultant Scott Jennings says hes getting no regulatory pushback on requests to extend work windows from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pmright into rush hour. Im as busy now, or busier now than Ive been in the last three, four years, he says.
Like most booms, this surge in road work will come with a bust. Drivers may inconvenience those fixing up roads, but they also pay for that work. The traffic lull could cause states fuel tax revenues to fall 30 to 40 percent over the next 18 months, according to the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials. Plummeting car sales mean states collect greatly reduced registration and title fees. This is money they count on to fund the transportation projects they sponsor, the associations executive director, Jim Tymon, said in a webinar this week."
5,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Maryn McKenna,Will Covid-19 Go Away In the Summer and Return in the Fall?,"Researchers want to know if the disease is seasonal, like colds. But while heat and humidity harm the virus in the lab, that’s not the same as real life.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-might-the-change-of-seasons-affect-covid-19/,,2020-05-04T11:00:00Z,"But why they are is a bit of a mystery. Researchers have speculated that changes in ambient temperature and humidity may make these viruses less viable by affecting their outer proteins and membrane, or by altering how quickly the virus-carrying droplets from mouth and throat evaporate. On the other hand, the change in infection rate might be due to the ways that people change their behavior with the seasons, going from being enclosed in offices and schools to opening windows and spending more time outdoors. (Getting more sunlight, which drives Vitamin D production and might enhance the immune systems defenses, might play a role, too.)
More subtly, its also possible that changes in temperature and humidity affect our bodies in ways that make them more or less vulnerable to viral infection. Cold, dry air damages the cells that line the respiratory tract, which might leave them less able to recruit defenses against viruses. Warm, moist air might be protective: It hydrates the layer of mucus that lies on top of cells and insulates them from viruses and microscopic particles.
Whatever the reason, the seasonal effect for the flu and some kinds of colds is real: They peak during the colder months in both hemispheres. Its different, though, in places that dont have cold months, or seasons. In the tropics, flu infections occur year round. That also may have an environmental explanation. Humidity keeps virus-containing droplets from losing their water content; instead of becoming lighter, which lets them float through the air on the way to someone elses nasal passages, they fall out of the air onto surfaces. And theres some evidence that flu transmission in the tropics depends less on breathing the virus in and more on transferring it from a surface to a persons eyes or nose or mouth. (In other words: Life finds a way.)
It turns out that the known human coronaviruses, the ones that are part of the mix of germs that cause common colds, have seasonality too. Last month, a team led by longtime flu researcher Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan analyzed 8 years of data from an ongoing study of respiratory infections that is normally used to assess whether the annual flu vaccine is working as intended. They found that four already-known coronavirusesnone of them the new pandemic strainwere circulating during those years, and that all four of them were what the team called sharply seasonal. They arrived in November or December, peaked in January or February, and disappeared after May. A study 10 years ago found a similar pattern in infections among kids in day care.
But those coronaviruses have been adapting to humans and interacting with our immune systems for a long time. Viruses that are new to humans seem not to follow that seasonal rule. Take, for instance, the 2009 H1N1 flu. It wasnt a seasonal strain when it debuted; it was a new-to-us virus that crossed over from pigs and began infecting humans as the regular flu season was ending. It continued to infect people throughout the summer, and then the case count rose into the fall and winter. By the following year, though, it had become another seasonal flu strain.
We have seen before that novel pathogens behave differently in their first year than after they become established and have an opportunity to circulate in the human population, says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Making matters more complicated, the coronavirus that broke out in 2003, causing the worldwide epidemic of SARS, moved through the world in February but was completely gone by June. Some of its squelching was due to aggressive interventions, such as quarantine and social distancing. But some may have been due to rising temperatures. A study published in 2011 by researchers in Hong Kong, where the SARS outbreak was intense, found that the virus did survive better in cool, dry places. They hypothesized that might have protected some parts of Southeast Asia, but might actually have facilitated transmission in Hong Kong and Singapore, because those affluent cities have so much air conditioning.

And, to be clear, that coronavirus is not this one. The virus behind Covid-19 is perplexing in so many ways, from the people it attacks to the range of illness it causes to its wild array of symptoms. Unlike its cousin, the original SARS virus, it seems perfectly happy to spread in tropical climates. And new research, also reviewed by the National Academies committee and subsequently published as a preprint, shows it may be extremely sturdy even in conditions that would daunt other viruses."

Covid-19 Could Halt That Progress,"The disease once paralyzed 350,000 children each year; vaccination campaigns brought it down to just a few hundred cases. Then, the pandemic struck.",https://www.wired.com/story/polio-is-nearly-wiped-out-covid-19-could-halt-that-progress/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ec58ec9a1675c5749a138e7/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_polioresearch-736377675.jpg",2020-05-21T11:00:00Z,"One of the risks, though, is that if the virus doesnt latch on in the gut in quantities sufficient to create full immunity, it leaves these children partially vulnerable. And in rare circumstances, the vaccine virus mutates as it reproduces, reverting back to the virulence of the wild form and creating a polio paralysis that is indistinguishable from the original infection.
So children in areas where the polio virus still circulates, or where a vaccine-derived virus pops up unexpectedly, might be at risk in several different ways: They might never have been vaccinated, because religious pressure or civil unrest makes it impossible to bring kids and vaccinators together, or their vaccine protection might be incomplete.
To reach children who have never been vaccinated, as well as to keep up immunity in kids who havent fully developed it, countries where polio is still extantAfghanistan and Pakistan, and a dozen African nationsstage mass campaigns with the help of the global initiative. (Its main supporters, in addition to the WHO and Rotary, are the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNESCO, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.) On those campaign days, children and parents gather so that kids can receive the vaccine drops; on one day, the gatherings can total millions of families in a country. Those are followed by mop-up days in which thousands of vaccinators comb through neighborhoods, from house to house, to track down children who were missed.
Those mass campaigns, which can occur multiple times a year in vulnerable countries, are the ones that have been suspended. Large gatherings are considered too dangerous, and sending vaccinators into neighborhoods risks them carrying an unrecognized coronavirus infection with them, or picking the virus up from one house and transferring it to another.
Those kinds of calculations posed an agonizing choice for the polio campaign, according to Dr. Steven Cochi, a senior adviser in the CDCs Global Immunization Division and its liaison to the global polio campaign. Suspending the mass campaigns takes away the ability to put a ring fence of vaccination around an outbreak, and deprives kids who have already started the vaccine regimen of an opportunity to keep their immunity up. How do you find the sweet spot between the risk of reopening society, and staying so shut down youre not able to protect children? Cochi asks.
The biggest risk is that the pause leaves vulnerable any children whose families are in remote or conflict-ridden areas, who rely on the mass gatherings for their kids earliest vaccinations because they cannot safely reach a clinic or doctor. While vaccination efforts are on hold, children will keep being bornand while newborns retain some immunity from their mothers, that doesnt last. Between 6 and 12 months of age, children lose the protective antibodies they get from their mothers, Cochi says. That erosion of population immunityagainst polio, measles, any vaccine-preventable diseaseerodes pretty quickly. The longer this goes on, the more of a cohort of susceptible people gets built up.
The math behind these decisions is tricky. In April, a modeling project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine tried to calculate the hazards of taking children to be vaccinated, and potentially exposing them, their families, and health care workers to Covid-19, versus leaving them unvaccinated, and thus risking them catching these preventable diseases. In a paper that is still online as a preprint (not yet peer-reviewed), researchers in the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases estimated that some deaths from Covid-19 exposures would happenbut anywhere from 37 to 549 other deaths would be avoided, because children would not develop diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis, meningitis, or yellow fever.

Amid Covid-19s social distancing, the polio campaign and the national health care systems it partners with are struggling to keep routine vaccinations going at clinics. In Nigeria, the country that has been hit hardest by vaccine-derived polio, there is an aggressive effort to persuade clinic workers that it is safe to stay on the job."

But Wood has a proxy metric that might at least indicate when a room is potentially riskier to be in. He measures the level of carbon dioxidefiguring that as people breathe in the available oxygen and exhale CO2, everyone else in the room then inhales it, and any airborne pathogens as well.
In technical terms, standards for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems measure ventilation by calculating how often the air in a room swaps out for fresh air from outsidethats air changes per hour. But CO2 levels could potentially be an easier way to alert people if a room needs an air swap for safety. Anything above 1,000 parts per million in an enclosed space, Wood says, would be a sign that its time to open the windows or clear out.
Heres where things get complicated. These variations in small-particle behavior dont just apply to individuals or single spaces, but how the disease moves across all of them. Epidemiologists are starting to see the spread of Covid-19 not as a cloud or wave moving ineluctably around the world, but instead more like signals moving through a network. The close-quarter, asymptomatic infections that small particles make more likely might also explain the patchy, checkerboard spread of Covid-19 through households, cities, and even across the country.
People intuitively think that population density, like in a big city, would lead to more transmissionand at first glance, the massive outbreak in New York City seems to confirm that. But people mostly transmit the virus within their own networks, their own contacts. Thats who the virus jumps to. I might have basically five to 10 friends that I tend to spend more than 15 minutes in close contact with on a regular basis, wherever Im living, Metcalf says. Yet big cities might lead to more contacts outside of our social networkscasual contacts like commuting may be more frequent, and of course social networks may also be more dense.
The result, she says, could be spikier outbreaks that change with urban forms and even the weather. (Some viruses are seasonal and transmit better in cold, dry air versus heat and humidity, but a sticky August outside can mean cranked-high AC inside, which can actually spread a virus if its not filtered correctly.) This is all part of what Benjamin Dalziel, a population biologist at Oregon State University, calls spatiotemporal heterogeneity, variability in the way the disease spreads in different places at different times. That spottiness in transmission means that different kinds of public health interventions will be more or less effective depending on when and where theyre usedpersonal protective equipment and serious ventilation in some settings, rigorously enforced social distancing in others, moving businesses outdoors, continued disinfecting of surfaces, and so on.
Thats how to stop the virus from moving through the world, and its what scientists are trying to understand. Its about the focal points of transmission within a population, and understanding that some places and times are more important for propagating spread than others, Dalziel says. Physical distancing measures are blunt tools that address a fundamental prerequisite for transmission, but they are untenable over the long term. It would be really wonderful if there were one, or a few, factors like that where we could efficiently identify them, make a change, and see a widespread reduction in transmission while still being able to reopen. Wouldnt that be fantastic? he asks. But whats probably more likely is that theres a large number of factors that all contribute. There isnt going to be a magic bullet.
Meanwhile, the CDC has released recommendations on opening restaurants and schools promoting six feet of space between people, doing things outdoors, and mask-wearingeven as the president says he thinks places of worship should be able to hold indoor services. It cant be true that large groups gathering in small spaces are dangerous if youre eating but safe if youre praying. Even if thats how the world looks to some people, its clearly not the world of the virus.

But now a trial into an experimental Covid-19 vaccine is giving us one reason to be hopeful.
This story originally appeared on WIRED UK.
Results from a team at the University of Oxford show that its vaccineco-developed with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZenecais safe in humans and provokes an immune response. While this is a long way from being a fully working vaccine, its a promising, and vital, first step towards getting one.
Heres everything you need to know about the Oxford study, and what it means for the future of Covid-19 vaccines.
The Oxford team found that its vaccine provoked an immune response and didnt produce any serious side effects. The vaccine prompted neutralising antibodiesthe kind that defends cells against attack from virusin at least nine out of ten of those who had a single dose of the vaccine. The immune response peaked 28 days after the vaccine, but remained high until day 56, which was the final day covered by this scientific paper. The study is still ongoing.
The results are from a study involving 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55. Half of the participants received the new Covid-19 vaccine, while the other halfthe control groupreceived a vaccine against a bacterial infection. Although no serious side effects were reported, around 70 percent of participants developed either a fever or a headache, although this was lower in a sub-group of participants who took a paracetamol around the same time they had the vaccination.
At this stage, the study cant tell us whether people who have the vaccine are protected against contracting Covid-19, but it does tell us that the vaccine is safe to use, and that it provokes an immune response.
Not yet, no. But this news is still significant. A less encouraging result at this early stage would have been really bad news. Now we know that this vaccine is safe to useand is able to kick the immune system into gearwe can start to explore whether it actually provides protection against those people who are exposed to the virus.
Luckily, that work is already underway. In Brazil, 5,000 people are being enrolled into a trial where they will receive the vaccination and track whether those who have been vaccinated become ill with the virus. A similar trial using the same vaccine is underway in South Africa. In the UK, 10,000 more volunteers are being recruited into the Oxford trial, but here the background rate of infection is relatively low so there is a chance that many people who are vaccinated wont come into contact with the virus anyway, and its protective abilities would never get put to the test.
The study does have some serious limitations too. Over 90 percent of the participants were white, and the average age was 35. To make sure the vaccine is safe for everyone, it will need to be tested on a much wider group of people, including older people, those with other health conditions and those from more ethnically and geographically diverse backgrounds. The authors say that people from these groups are being recruited in the ongoing trials in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa.
That sounds about right. We dont yet know whether having antibodies against Covid-19 actually gives us immunity against the disease, but there are some encouraging signs that may be the case, at least in the short term. A small study on macaque monkeys found that the animals could catch Covid-19, but couldnt be reinfected 28 days after they recovered, with another study finding that protection lasted at least five weeks."

While Abbott and Thermo Fisher are willing to work with Amazon, according to the notes, demand from the US government is apparently taking up all their available capacity. Amazon was nonetheless hopeful that other companies would follow in its path if testing went ahead.
Amazon has declined to comment, while Abbott and Thermo Fisher haven't addressed the report so far.
If accurate, the scoop suggests that Amazon is aware of how important it is to keep infected workers out of its warehouses, whether or not recent protests influenced its thinking. Amazon has increasingly become important during the pandemic as a way to shop for food, health supplies and other necessities without leaving home. Even one infection at a warehouse (19 warehouses have had incidents so far) could leave people without vital goods for a while if it prompts a temporary closure.
At the same time, this also hints that Amazon still has a long way to go before it has a complete defense against COVID-19. The outbreak has already been present in the US for weeks, and Amazon is only just implementing face masks and temperature checks. Even if test supplies weren't a factor, the pandemic could be at or past its peak before warehouse staff have assurances that their coworkers are healthy."

Seattle is on the cusp of making it law in that city.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-opens-door-gig-workers-sick-pay/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5edae662181421e8a634534f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/business_gig_1226499017.jpg",2020-06-07T11:00:00Z,"As Covid-19 made its grim march around the country in March, Seattle became the first American city to close down. It was the first, too, where gig workers began to report that jobs had dried up, or that they had stopped working because they were scared for their health.
Last week, the city notched another first. An emergency ordinance passed by the Seattle City Council would require app-based companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart to pay their workers a form of sick pay, based on the number of days theyve worked for the company and the amount theyre earned. A spokesperson for Mayor Jenny Durkan said she will sign the bill.
We have done our due diligence in taking care of these companies by helping them grow, says Mia Kelly, a former Instacart shopper who is now an organizer with the workers organization Working Washington. These companies will now have to recognize us gig workers as their employees, and will have to do something about taking care of us.
The ordinance tops a stormy spring for gig workers, who have worked on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic since local and statewide shutdowns began in March. In many cities, the workers have been categorized as essential, even as some companies struggled to get them adequate protective equipment. Most gig companies have created funds for workers who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, or been put under quarantine by a public health agency. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi personally lobbied the White House to include gig workers in the federal pandemic relief assistance bill, the first time such independent contractors were included in a form of unemployment insurance. But some workerstold news outlets they had difficulty getting documents to access the aid, or getting the companies to respond to their requests.
For driver advocates, sick pay has been the hot button labor issue of the pandemic. The reason is simple: Infected workers giving rides and delivering meals are a public health hazard.
The new Seattle ordinance, which is in place until at least the end of 2023, gives companies a choice: grant workers one day of paid sick leave for every 30 days theyve signed on to work for the app since October 2019, or give everyone five days and then another day for each 30 after that. The money a worker gets on her sick day is an average of what she was paid per working day, including bonuses and tips.
In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company has significant concerns about the Seattle City Council considering emergency measures that single out one sector without meaningful input from the public or groups that may be affected. A Lyft spokesperson said the company is concerned that Seattle drivers receiving sick pay would not be eligible for federal relief funds. DoorDash did not respond to a request for comment.
So far, Seattles model has not made it to other cities. But Kelly, the organizer, says shes fielded calls from gig workers in states like North Carolina, California, and New York.
In California, federal judges have rejected legal requests by Uber and Lyft drivers for emergency sick pay, and ordered at least two cases into arbitration. As a result of one of those proceedings, Uber said it would pay $360 to regular California drivers who self-certify that theyve either been diagnosed with Covid-19 or have exhibited symptoms.
Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing drivers in lawsuits in California and Massachusetts, said the Uber concession was the first step in a broader fight to classify gig workers as employees. I think this crisis has opened a lot of peoples eyes to the injustice that exists with all of these workers not having the protections of employees, she says."

We convinced the CEO of an air filter company to give it a try.",https://www.wired.com/story/could-a-janky-jury-rigged-air-purifier-help-fight-covid-19/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f2b4792242109ea19ea7a10/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_DIY-Air-Purifier-870165544.jpg",2020-08-06T11:00:00Z,"Thats a good question. How much air is cleaned? Portable air purifiers get described in terms of a number called the Clean Air Delivery Rate, a combination of the efficiency of the filter in pulling gunk out of the air and the speed of air pushed through the system. CADR conveys that in cubic feet per minute, and clean buildings researchers now recommend five complete change-outs of the air in a classroom every hour. So ideally youd use the cubic footage of the room and the CADR of the filter set-up to figure out how big a purifier, or how many, you need. (CADR isnt the be-all/end-all, either. Its calculations assume that a room is what researchers call a well-mixed box, which is to say, homogeneously mixed air and pollutants throughout. Thats not how things work with pathogens in the real world.)
When I talked to Rosenthal about all this, he graciously offered to go out, buy a 20-inch box fan, slam together a set-up, and use his companys extensive testing gear to see how much particle reduction he got. He actually used a four-inch-thick filter (more expensive, but more filtration, and you dont have to change them as often).
Rosenthal put his fan/filter in the Tex-Air Filters tool room, next to the companys factoryhe wanted a massive particle count. And then he used his companys enviable array of analytic technology to take some readings. Running the fan only reduced the overall number of 0.3 micron particles by about 25 percent. But remember, thats not the relevant range. Viruses are reeeeeal small, but in the air theyre riding inside biggerbut still quite teensydessicated balls of protein and salt. The ones hanging around as airborne infectious problems are anywhere from 1 to 50 microns, and in Rosenthals informal test, particles between 1 and 10 microns took a huge hit. His rig sucked about 60 percent of the 1-micron particles out of the air, and nearly 90 percent of the 10-micron ones.
Of course, that only gives you single-pass removal efficiency, not volumetric airflow through the device. Rosenthal didnt have that, but he did use his anemometernot, as you might suspect, a device for measuring sea anemones, but a windmill-like airspeed sensoron the outflow. Without the filter, the fans medium setting gave him 780 feet per minute. A one-inch thick MERV-13 filter dropped that to 320 feet per minute. But, in a counter-intuitive twist, the four-inch thick filter yielded an airspeed of 460 feet per minute. Thats because the fan generates positive pressure, a push. The positive pressure is distributed over the area of the filter. The face area of the filter is one thing; the media area of the filter is another, Rosenthal says. If you have a pleated filter, you have substantially more media area, so the pressure is distributed over the greater media area, and consequently you have greater air flow.
In other words: A thicker filter gives you more filtration and better airflow, letting you refresh the room as if more outside air was getting in to replace whatever possibly virus-laden particles are there.
Rosenthal wouldnt venture to calculate a CADR, though. This is all too informal. This is not an air purifier and I would not recommend estimating CADR. This is a high efficiency filter on a box fan, he says.
This isnt science yet. These arent peer-reviewed studies. This hasnt been tested under ideal conditions multiple times. No one has run these stats. Caveat experimenter. Still, thoughseems worth it. Right? Sure, absolutely. Its an air purifier. Its not a HEPA air purifier, but its a reasonably good air purifier, Rosenthal says. If thats the only option, Id rather see people do that than have nothing."

AT&amp;T is taking a slightly different approach, removing usage caps. Until now, some customers have seen usage caps ranging from 150 GB to 1 terabyte per month, Motherboard explains. Users who surpassed those limits could be penalized $10 per additional 50 gigabytes, or more. It's unclear if those caps will come back when the pandemic settles down.
We may see more ISPs taking action to improve internet speeds, access and usage soon. Today, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called on the FCC to take aggressive action in response to COVID-19. We don't know yet what that will look like, but if AT&amp;T and Comcast are any indication, it could include a push to increase speeds and lift data caps.

That breakthrough turned out to be a change in the bureaucratic status of convalescent plasma, a treatment made from the blood of people who have recovered from the diseaseone that most people can already get, that at least 70,000 people have already received (and probably more like 100,000), and that despite the presidents assurances currently lacks solid evidence for its effectiveness.
It is proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. Its a tremendous number, President Trump said at the press conference. Based on this data, the FDA has made the determination the treatment is safe and very effective. That last part isnt actually true yetwithout large-scale randomized controlled trials, which havent happened yet, no one actually knows that for sure. Yet the agency has issued whats called an Emergency Use Authorization, not quite an approval of the treatment but still giving the all-clear to physicians who want to administer the frothy, yellow liquid.
Based on the presidents comments, and those of FDA head Stephen Hahn and HHS director Alex Azar, the data that tipped plasma into getting this Emergency Use Authorization came from a nationwide program to give people wider access to convalescent plasma, led by researchers at the Mayo Clinic. That program was not a large, randomized, controlled clinical trial, which is typically the standard for determining whether a treatment is safe and effective. That expanded access program did publish some outcomes in a preprint two weeks ago. It still hasnt been peer-reviewed, but the researchers did keep track of the levels of antibodies, disease-fighting molecules, in the plasma administered to 35,000 people. It turned out that those people who received plasma earlier, and with the highest levels of antibodies, did have an increased survival rate. But the 35 percent number wasnt for everyone who got plasma, just a specific statistical slice of the tens of thousands who received plasma sooner and with higher antibody levels. And even though the people who set up the expanded access program wanted to run concurrent randomized, controlled trials, thats not what this was.
The timing of the announcement makes the whole thing even weirder. The president, who during this weeks Republican Party National Convention will presumably accept his partys nomination to run for a second term, is under increasing pressure to show some progress in the fight against Covid-19a disease from which nearly 175,000 Americans have died, with little sign of abatement. The only randomized trials that have published data on plasma so far have been small and, while promising, inconclusive.
Technically, thats fine for an EUA. The criteria for issuing one really just demand reasonable safety and the possibility of usefulness. The agency still maintains that itll take actual randomized trials to make convalescent plasma into standard care. And its not clear that the authorization does anything that the expanded-access program wasnt already doing, making sure anyone who wanted plasma could get it.
Its sufficient for an Emergency Use Authorization in the sense that most EUAs make no claim of benefit. They simply authorize utilization during the emergency, and when the emergency is over they are automatically cancelled, says Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. That said, this is one of the more frustrating examples, where we have had every opportunity to do proper randomized trials on convalescent plasma. The sole excuse offered back in February and March was, We dont have time, and its now nearly September."

Some recovered patients can harbor the viruss genetic material inside their nose and throats for months, long after their symptoms have subsided. That can lead to positive test results even in the absence of an active infection.
People have assumed these reports were not true reinfections, but cases of prolonged viral shedding, says Susan Kline, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. This Hong Kong case, on the other hand, looks like the real deal to her. The evidence here, with the sequences of the virus, is quite strong that this patient really was infected with a different strain the second time, she says.
Reinfection is possible, yes. But just how common is it? Thats still unclear. Few swabs taken from patients are later used to extract a full viral sequence, enabling this kind of genetic detective work. And regular screening of people with no symptoms only happens in nations that have largely kicked Covid-19. In the US, where access to rapid testing is still hit-or-miss, such screening is often only conducted for health care workers and inside nursing homes and some prisons. I suspect there are likely more patients like this out there, says Kline.
For now, theres just the one. That makes it impossible to say what reinfection will look like in other people. But at the time of his second infection, it appears this particular person lacked what immunologists call sterilizing immunity, says John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Thats when a persons immune system is able to completely stifle the viruss ability to replicate, meaning no infection occurs at all.
In reality, Wherry says, that is a very high bar to set. The second time the body encounters a virus, it has a head-start against intruders: neutralizing antibodies, which glom onto specific proteins on the invading pathogen and prevent it from entering cells. Usually, those antibodies stick around at some level after an initial infection or shot of a vaccine. But its an imperfect defense system. Even the best vaccines only protect 90 to 95 percent of the population from reinfection, Wherry notes. Similarly, natural infections by respiratory viruses almost always leave some chance of reinfection. Maybe the second time around there arent enough antibodies on handtheyve waned, perhaps, or the body didnt mount much of a response in the first place. Or maybe those antibodies are not perfectly adept at plugging up the proteins the virus uses to latch onto a cell. In that case, some virus winds up getting inside and begins to replicate. A new infection has begun.
What turns an infection into an illness largely depends on what comes next. During the primary infection, the body has never seen the virus before, so its stuck creating a customized immune response from scratch: an army of B cells that help create antibodies specific to the viruss proteins, and T cells that help identify virus particles and eliminate infected cells. But while those forces are being mustered, the virus has an ample window of opportunityperhaps a week to 10 days, Wherry estimatesto replicate and spread. By then, the virus has spread around the lungs and outside the lungs, and when the troops show up youve got a big problem on their hands, he says."

Netflix on Thursday announced the launch of a unique Stranger Things immersive theater production its calling a drive-into experience, in which its transforming a series of buildings in downtown Los Angeles into what is effectively a cross between a theme park and a live theater show. The central hook: you can drive your car through the entire thing and never have to get out. It sounds like a savvy way to capitalize on the hunger for live events during the pandemic while trying to give people an experience thats safe and sensibly designed. 
The company says it will be featuring iconic locations from the show, including the newly opened Starcourt Mall, the secret underground Russian lab, and the supernatural Upside Down from the shows third season, which debuted last summer. You wont have to leave your car, but there will be moments when you can stop to watch various actors in scenes that happen concurrently, in the style of influential immersive theater productions like Sleep No More. (Realistically, its probably more like your standard haunted house or walk-through theme park experience.) 
A live Stranger Things event designed to be safe during the pandemic
Netflix is partnering with event platform Fever and creative production company Secret Cinema, the same company that helped it stage a Hawkins High School Reunion in the UK, to pull everything together. 
The beloved Netflix original series, created by The Duffer Brothers, will be transformed into an immersive theatrical production, complete with mind-bending sets, actors in costume, and otherworldly special effects. Upon entry, guests will drive their vehicles (in groups of 24 cars) through the multi-level experience, stopping for extended periods of time for scenes to play out around them, the announcement reads. They will then be guided to drive to the next scene, where they park again for another chapter in the story.
Netflix says tickets will go on sale starting Wednesday, August 26th, with pricing starting at $59 per car. It says there will be a variety of packages available, although its unclear what other price tiers may be available or what else Netflix may bundle alongside the cost of admission."

Image: Netflix
Netflix has canceled its adaptation of Altered Carbon after two seasons, according to Variety, marking the end of yet another big-budget adaptation for the streaming service. 
According to Deadline, the cancellation was decided back in April, and was made for the companys usual cost / benefit reasons. In other words, Altered Carbons fate isnt apparently COVID-19 related as has been the case with other recent Netflix cancellations, like The Society and I Am Not Okay With This, both of which hadsecond season plans nixed due to circumstances created by COVID, according to a Netflix statement at the time. 
The fact that Altered Carbon got the axe isnt too surprising
The fact that Altered Carbon got the axe isnt too surprising, though. The show debuted in 2018 as a marquee series for Netflix: a gritty, adult sci-fi series based on a popular series of novels with a sky-high budget (season one star Joel Kinnaman described it as a bigger budget than the first three seasons of Game of Thrones), big action sequences and bigger philosophical issues about what it meant to be human. 
Unfortunately, the show debuted to middling praise, and while it clearly did well enough that Netflix was willing to roll the dice on a second season (which debuted earlier this year), the series clearly was hit with a smaller budget for its second time around, with fewer episodes and less flashy sets and effects but if anything, the second season made even less of an impact. Altered Carbon just wasnt going to be the next Game of Thrones, which meant that Netflix wasnt going to keep spending HBO-levels of money on it. 
Its a cycle reminiscent of Altered Carbonspreceding big-budget sci-fi Netflix series: Sense8, which cost an estimated (and eye-watering) $9 million per episode, making it one of the most expensive TV shows ever made before it was also canceled by Netflix after two seasons. 
But unlike Altered Carbon, Sense8 had garnered a deeply dedicated fanbase which, while apparently not big enough to justify the continued expense of the show on Netflixs accounting sheet, was enough to get the streaming company to bring the series back for a final two-hour special to wrap up the series. 
In the earlier days of Netflixs original content empire, the streamer was far more likely to keep shows around for several seasons, content to give each series the chance to find an audience over time. But as Netflixs output has exploded from a handful of shows and films to hundreds, theres far more competition and a much lower bar for success. The result is that more Netflix originals especially expensive ones like Altered Carbonhave been canceled after just a season or two."

Two games more games originally set to release later this year have been pushed back to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Deathloop and The StanleyParable: Ultra Deluxe are now slated to launch sometime next year as the coronavirus continues to disrupt the development of both titles. 
Both Arkane Studios, and Crows Crows Crows addressed their respective communities in separate update posts shared on Twitter, commenting that due to multiple development challenges including COVID-related impacts both games would have to be delayed to a new 2021 release window to ensure they have enough time to develop the games. 
Deathloop is a new intellectual property by Arkanes Lyon studio, the developer of Dishonored series and the 2017 version of Prey.

(There are currently nineteen different endings available in the original, each hilariously wild in its own way.) 
Deathloop and The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe arent the only games to be delayed from a late 2020 launch to 2021. Last week, Microsoft announced that instead of launching Halo Infinite alongside the Xbox Series X in November, the game would launch sometime in 2021.

The Presidential elections are nearly upon us. Amidst all the crises that we are now experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental emergencies, protests against racism, and an extraordinarily divided electorate it is vital that, if you are a US citizen and 18 years of age or older, you make use of your vote.
Along with all the other upheavals were dealing with, the very process of voting has come into contention. While many voters are anxious to get their ballots in, they dont want to expose themselves to possible infection in small, crowded voting areas, so voting by mail has become the main alternative. But many of us are not familiar with that process, especially because a number of states have been adjusting their rules to allow as many people to vote by mail as possible. Add to that the recent political cockfights over the administration of the US Post Office and the electioneering over the legitimacy of vote-by-mail, and you have a recipe for complete confusion. 
So what do you do? Well, you do your research.
To begin with, when you can vote and how you can vote depends on which state you live in. Some states already offer voting by mail and will send ballots to registered voters automatically. Others will allow you to vote by mail during this pandemic, but you need to apply for a ballot. And a few still demand that you have an approved reason (not including I dont want to catch a possibly fatal disease during a pandemic) to be able to obtain an absentee ballot.
So its important to make sure that (a) youre registered, (b) if you are voting in person, you know where to go, and (c) if you want to vote by mail, you know what the rules are in your local area and / or your state. And you want to do all this as soon as possible.
But what you do not want to do is get your information from a random tweet, or from your Uncle Al who heard it from a friend of his. Here are a few more reliable resources.
<ul><li>The official government site USA.gov has a drop-down menu that will take you to your states Board of Elections site. The Board of Elections is the best place to go for information about registering and voting.</li></ul>
USA.gov
<ul><li>According to its website, Vote.org is the largest 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-partisan voting registration and get out the vote (GOTV) technology platform in America. The site allows you to register to vote, check an existing registration, request an absentee ballot, and even get election reminders.</li><li>If you type how to vote in your Google search box, youll get information specific to the state that Google thinks youre in; theres a drop-down menu to change that. Youre probably safest if the link you click has a .gov domain, although since many states are using third-party services for registration and information, that isnt an absolute.</li><li>If youre unsure about any information you get, either online or off make a call. Yeah, its a bit old-fashioned, but if you feel that your local site is either not informative enough or confusing, you can call your local Board of Elections (the phone number will be on your state Board of Elections site). Of course, with offices closed all over the country due to COVID-19, it may be difficult to reach someone, but be persistent this is your vote, after all.</li></ul>A few more words of advice:
<ul><li>Be aware that even those who should know about the process involved may be confused. For example, when a staffer from The Verge called their local borough office of the NYC Board of Elections, the person who answered didnt know that NYC was now offering an online tool to apply for an absentee ballot. When the staffer tried calling the main NYC BoE office, the person at the other end of the line not only knew about the online application, but suggested that they register for the ballot both online and by sending in an application via regular mail. Either way, the person said, they will only get one ballot but at least the ballot would be more likely to arrive. The moral of the story? If youre unsure of the information youve received, try again.</li><li>When you get your ballot, read the instructions. Twice. And then check them once more when youve completed your ballot. Many states have complicated rules about how to fill out, sign, and send in an absentee ballot, and a single misplaced signature can mean your vote will not be counted.</li><li>Avoid filling out your ballot on the kitchen table, or anywhere else where a stray ketchup stain or a streak from your kids crayons might be an excuse for invalidation.</li><li>You cant vote often, but you should vote and apply for your absentee ballot as early as possible. On several of the official sites, I saw warnings about leaving plenty of time for applications and ballots to be delivered, even though some of the excitement surrounding the slow-downs at the United States Postal Service has died down. </li><li>And finally, you can always vote the old-fashioned way: at your local polling place. Check with your local Board of Elections as to where to go, and if you wish, call them to find out what precautions they are taking to protect voters from infection. </li></ul>But however you choose to vote, please do so. This year, more than any, its important."

DoorDash workers in the U.S., Australia and Canada are eligible for up to two weeks of financial assistance if they get sick with COVID-19 or a public health agency places them under quarantine. The caveat is that workers must have been active on DoorDash for at least 60 days and have completed at least 30 deliveries in the last 30 days. The same goes for Caviar workers, who only operate in the U.S.
DoorDash says it is also shipping more than 1 million sets of hand sanitizer and gloves to its workers who are frequently interacting with customers. Additionally, the default method of delivery for DoorDash will now be no-contact, which means workers will leave the food at the customer’s door by default. Customers can still opt in to having the workers hand it directly to them, but workers can still initiate a no-contact delivery if that’s their preference.
DoorDash joins the likes of Uber, Instacart and Postmates, which have also taken some steps to help gig workers. Uber, for example, set up funds to support drivers who are infected or placed in quarantine by a public health authority. Instacart introduced a sick pay policy for in-store shoppers and extended pay for all shoppers, including independent contractors, who are affected by COVID-19. Similarly, Postmates has started offering two weeks of paid sick leave for people who test positive for the virus. These announcements come after gig workers have put pressure on companies and the government to ensure better protection for them during this pandemic.
Just yesterday, San Francisco announced a shelter-in-place order that legally requires people to stay home as much as possible unless it’s essential that they leave to do things like going to the grocery store, buying gas or going to the pharmacy. Gig workers, however, are perceived as essential. That means workers for Postmates, Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats are still on the hook for delivering food to people, and rideshare drivers transporting passengers are at risk of contracting the virus.
Gig Workers Rising is also pushing legislators in California to immediately enforce AB 5, which would ensure workers have access to good health care, paid sick leave, disability leave and more. It’s worth noting that DoorDash is one of the companies that has spent millions of dollars to oppose AB 5. The ballot initiative put forth by DoorDash, Uber, Lyft and other gig companies is a direct response to the legalization of AB-5, the gig worker bill that will make it harder for the likes of Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig economy companies to classify their workers as 1099 independent contractors.

While COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Clara is intended for use by people currently in the United States. According to the CDC, as of March 22, there were more than 15,200 cases in the United States, and 200 deaths.
In a statement, Microsoft said screening patients who have cold or flu-like symptoms to determine who needs “access to limited medical resources” creates a “bottleneck that threatens to overwhelm health systems coping with the crisis.” Its Healthcare Bot uses AI and is intended to help the CDC answer more queries, enabling medical professionals to look after patients who need critical care, the company said.

This isn’t a map of confirmed COVID-19 cases other sources for that information already exist, including Google’s coronavirus map, which uses case numbers and figures provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the John Hopkins coronavirus resource center map. These are useful resources, but only reflect confirmed cases based on approved testing, which, especially in the U.S., is limited by testing availability and drastically under-represents the actual spread according to most experts.
New ways of tracking the spread of the virus are needed in order to supplement testing efforts, and while self-reported symptoms are hardly a reliable indicator of actual COVID-19 spread, they are a potential signal or leading indicator that, combined with other data included confirmed cases, can help researchers and medical professionals focus their efforts and gauge the effectiveness of strategies like social distancing meant to slow or stop the spread.
Another recent project, Kinsa’s U.S. health weather map, also relies on crowdsourced data to try to provide a different view of the potential spread of COVID-19. Their information is body temperature, as recorded by their connected smart thermometer hardware, however, which provides a reliable measure of one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients.
Like the ‘Covid Near You’ map, Kinsa’s is not a reliable indicator of confirmed COVID-19 cases, but it is a strong signal that can provide information not available when relying on certified testing. Taken together, self-reported symptoms (especially as more people self-report using this new map), temperature data tied to geolocation, and confirmed cases could provide a much more complete picture of where hotspots are occurring, and the patterns of spread beyond those communities known to be most affected, and those that could be next in the chain of transmission."

The app aims to supplement information provided by testing programs and other public measures of the spread of the coronavirus using self-reported information provided by individuals. It includes a self-reporting quiz that takes roughly one minute per day to complete, and also provides an estimated picture of the potential spread of the virus in your immediate area.
There are a number of different, similar efforts to use self-reported information as a signal in determining the full spread of the virus, in the absence of plentiful, accurate and consistent testing across geographies. One other high-profile project, founded by Pinterest CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann, launched earlier this month, and offers a similar self-reporting mechanism, for similar purposes with a mandate of offering up information shared with research partners and health organizations.
The COVID-19 Symptom Tracker has the advantage of already having been used at scale in the U.K., and the information its gathering will be used in a study that’s already in progress, led by King’s College epidemiologist Tim Spector, along with Harvard Medical School professor and infectious disease specialist Andrew Chan. The research team is providing regular updates about their work and the project via a public blog, too.
The goals of the research resulting from the app include forming a better understanding of COVID-19s symptoms, and how they might cluster, as well as helping identify high-risk and high-spread areas, and figuring out who might be most at risk in future. Data shared by individuals is protected under GDPR, and it’s used strictly for non-profit purposes, with any commercial purposes off the table. The group behind the app also advises that while they may share information more broadly with other medical researchers, it strips the data of any potential identifying information before doing so.
These efforts can definitely contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and its transmission, and because they’re relatively low-lift in terms of how much time you need to spend with them, it’s probably worth considering using more than one. Sensitivities around sharing info are always going to vary, of course, but if you’re okay with the trade-offs outlined, this does seem like an easy way to do something from the comfort and safety of your own home."

The new guidance relaxes restrictions on employees who may have been exposed to COVID-19, focusing on implementing precautionary measures in the workplace rather than sending them home for self-isolation, as was the practice previously.
The CDC’s updated guidelines, which were adapted in order “to ensure continuity of essential functions” according to the agency, state that someone working in an essential capacity who has been potentially exposed (either through contact with a household member with COVID-19, or having come within 6 feet of someone who has a confirmed or suspected case) should remain at work, provided they don’t show any symptoms.
That’s not to say the CDC is advising they carry on as usual: they say that anyone who has had this kind of exposure, should have their temperature taken and their symptoms assessed prior to any shift, and that they should be engage in self-monitoring. They should also wear a mask whenever in their place of employment for at least 14 days following the exposure including cloth masks where proper face masks aren’t available because of shortages. They should also observe physical distancing from other employees, and all shared use areas and equipment should be regularly cleaned and disinfected.
The CDC further advises that anyone who comes sick during the day should be sent home immediately, and the employer should comply a list of anyone they might’ve been exposed to within two days prior to the symptoms showing up.
These changed rules were mentioned during the White House coronavirus task force briefing on Wednesday, and seem to be considered a necessary step by the agency and the administration to ensure that critical services continue to operate uninterrupted as COVID-19 continues to spread. The guidelines apply not only to full-time employees in essential roles, but also to “contracted vendors,” which likely includes Amazon warehouse employees and delivery drivers for services like Instacart and Uber Eats.

The tool, called the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), tracks 11 indicators to generate an index that compares the stringency of policy responses around the world.
Nation state responses to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to vary widely, both in timing and stringency. The UK, for example, only began imposing more stringent restrictions on Saturday, ordering bars and restaurants to close. Yet Denmark — a European country with fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 — took similar steps around a week earlier.
The index, which is being made freely available, contains data from 73 countries at launch — including China, South Korea, Italy, UK and USA. The academics say it will continue to be updated throughout the crisis.
The idea is to help policymakers and researchers understand the impacts of different state interventions and identify triggers for implementing more or less strict measures during the public health crisis.
The range of government interventions being tracked for the index are: 1. school closure; 2. workplace closures; 3. public event cancellation; 4. public transport closure; 5. public information campaigns; 6. restriction on internal movement; 7. international travel controls; 8. fiscal measures; 9. monetary measures; 10. emergency investment in healthcare; 11. investment in vaccines.
The academics behind the project, from Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government, are relying on tracking publicly available information.
They caveat the effort by saying it obviously does not represent the fill picture, nor should it be interpreted as measuring “the appropriateness or effectiveness of a countrys response”.
Commenting in a statement, Thomas Hale, associate professor of global public policy at the School and lead for the project, said: Our index cannot, of course, tell the full story, but we believe the data we have collected can help decision makers and public health professionals examine the robustness of government responses and provide a first step into understanding exactly what measures have been effective in certain contexts, and why.
The OxCGRT can be found here — where project data and notes are also available for download."

The COVID-19 intubation box that this group is working to produce is a polycarbonate box that can be flat-packed for easy shipping, and assembled quickly on the receiving end, for use in healthcare facilities while medical personnel intubate a patient. Intubation is the process of inserting a plastic tube into a patient’s trachea to help keep their airway open, and is specifically necessary when someone needs to be put on a ventilator a common outcome for patients severely affected by COVID-19.
The intubation box provides healthcare workers with an additional layer of protection, while the transparent plastic used means they can still perform the procedure. The design is based on an open-sourced original plan that was released by Dr. Hsien Yung Lai, a medical practitioner in Taiwan, specifically to address the global challenge of intubating COVID-19 patients worldwide while maintaining care worker safety as much as is possible.
The COVID Box project provides instructions on how to make your own box with the requisite materials, but it is hoping to secure more mass production capacity to deliver them at scale, starting with Canadian hospitals and hopefully expanding to address healthcare needs around the world, too. Project co-founder Jonathan Norris (co-founder and CTO of Taplytics) said the team has been working for a week on prototyping and production.
“Early last week Taplytics Head of Finance, Gloria Cheung, came to us letting us know that a group of Doctors were looking to get a simple plastic box made to protect Medical Providers while intubating patients who have COVID-19,” he said via message. “We were able to connect the doctors with a group of engineers from Taplytics and folks I know from mentoring in the FIRST Robotics program, to design and build multiple prototypes of a flat-packable box designed for this use. We worked with Eventscape to quickly built prototypes and got the final version approved for use in the Trillium Health Network yesterday.”
The group is looking for donations to help scale its efforts, as well as manufacturing partners that can help especially those who have access to CNC router hardware, which is essentially the only equipment needed to put these out, as well as anyone who can supply 1/4″ polycarbonate sheets."

Operation Covid-19 will visualize both official and suspected cases of the Coronavirus in data lists and on a map, with the aim of saving lives and improving global public health systems. People will be able to self-report the case via an anonymous questionnaire.
The site aims to demonstrate how many official tests compared to suspected COVID-19 cases there are.
The more people who can contribute their COVID-19 experiences, we can turn the table on this pandemic and build more intelligence to save lives, said co-founder Jillian Kowalchuk.
Kowalchuk is cofounder of “street-smart” safety app Safe &amp; The City, but fell ill with COVID-19 symptoms after meeting the Prime Minister of Canada’s wife, Sophie Trudeau who later tested positive for the disease on March 5th at Canada House in London, as she Instagrammed.
She was later dismayed to learn she was refused a test for COVID-19 in a UK hospital and was instead told to go home and self-isolate, making her concerned about the lack of testing and public awareness of the scale of the problem.
First-hand experiences like this are becoming more common throughout the world as more are refused testing, leaving the majority of COVID-19 cases unknown, under-estimating the severity of the problem, limiting preventative measures and resource mobilization into other needed public health monitoring systems, she told TechCrunch .
The initiative will collect insights from people who have contracted COVID-19 to provide back to the medical and public health authorities.
In doing so it will create a map visualization of both official and self-reported COVID-19 cases, recovered and deaths to support best practices globally, including more testing.

YouTube typically adjusts the quality of your video based on the speed of your connection. If you have a high-speed connection, it should by default give you a high-definition video stream. Lower-speed connections are served standard-definition. But soon, YouTube will default to streaming video standard definition. You'll still be able to watch videos in high-definition, but you'll need to increase the resolution manually.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation, a Google spokesperson said in a statement. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today. The change was earlier reported by Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, network and cybersecurity company Akamai announced that it's working with Sony and Microsoft to voluntarily throttle video game download speeds during peak usage hours in areas facing internet congestion.
""This is very important for gaming software downloads which account for large amounts of internet traffic when an update is released,"" Akamai CEO Tom Leighton wrote in a blog post. ""A software update for a modern game generates an amount of traffic roughly equal to 30,000 web pages.""
The concern is that the growing number of people stuck at home watching streaming videos and playing video games during the pandemic will overwhelm internet infrastructure and make life harder for those who need to use the internet to consult with physicians, keep in touch with vulnerable family members, work from home, or finish school assignments.
In Europe, streaming video providers including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, are also slashing video streaming quality to avoid internet congestion.
Nokia's network analytics business Deepfield told WIRED earlier this month that it has seen internet traffic peaks 20 percent to 40 percent higher than usual over the past four weeks in areas highly impacted by Covid-19. The bulk of that increase comes from streaming video services like Netflix, with Netflix traffic increasing by 54 to 75 percent in some places.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
Thus far, internet infrastructure has held up to increased demand. Connection speeds have declined in areas heavily affected by Covid-19, according to data collected by internet analysis company Ookla. But in some of the hardest hit areas, average speeds were still faster this month than they were in December. That's starting to change in places like Italy and Malaysia, where speeds continue to decline; but other places, like the Seattle metropolitan area, are holding steady. It's also not clear whether the slower speeds are the result of overwhelmed internet infrastructure, or from home Wi-Fi routers struggling to meet the competing needs of entire households using the internet at the same time.
Deepfield CTO Craig Labovitz warned WIRED last week that though broadband providers have the capacity to handle traffic surges, if demand continues to grow at its current pace networks could run out of capacity.
Reducing the bandwidth needed for streaming services might help with that. But, according to Labovitz, upload speeds may end up being a bigger concern than download speeds. Most home broadband services cap upload speeds at a much lower rate than download speeds. As more people use videoconferencing for work or video chat apps to keep in touch with friends and family, those upload caps could become more of a burden.

The partnership is part of StopTheSpread.org, a coordinated effort of private companies to respond to COVId-19, a disease caused by coronavirus.
Ventec will use GM’s logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more ventilators. The companies did not provide further details such as when production might be able to ramp up or how many ventilators would be produced.
GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that GM is working closely with Ventec to rapidly scale up production.
We will continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis,” Barra added.
The need for ventilators is urgent as cases of COVID-19 pop up with increasing frequency as widespread testing begins. While some people with COVID-19 reported more mild symptoms, others have experienced severe respiratory problems and need to be hospitalized.
The shortage has prompted automakers to investigate ways of ramping up ventilator production. Volkswagen and Ford have reportedly either talked to the White House or committed to looking at the problem. Volkswagen said Friday it has created a task force to look into using 3D printing to make hospital ventilators.
Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla and SpaceX  employees are working on ventilators even though he doesnt believe they will be needed. His confirmation on Twitter that both of the companies he leads are working on ventilators comes a day after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio made a direct plea to Musk to help alleviate a shortage at hospitals gearing up to combat COVID-19.
Musk didn’t provide specifics what “working on ventilators” means, what Tesla factory might be used, the possible capacity or when he planned to begin production."

In recent days Twitter has similarly encouraged all staff members to work from home. While companies including Amazon, Google, LinkedIn and Microsoft have also advised some staff to work remotely to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus.
In its response statement Box writes that it’s enacted its business continuity plans “to ensure core business functions and technology are operational in the event of any potential disruption”.
“We have long recognized the potential risks associated with service interruptions due to adverse events, such as an earthquake, power outage or a public health crisis like COVID-19, affecting our strategic, operational, stakeholder and customer obligations. This is why we have had a Business Continuity program in place to provide the policies and plans necessary for protecting Boxs operations and critical business functions,” the company writes.
In a section on “workforce resilience and business continuity” it notes that work from home practices are a normal part of its business operations but says it’s now extending the option to all its staff, regardless of the office or location they normally work out of — saying it’s doing so “out of an abundance of caution during COVID-19”.
Other measures the company says it’s taken to further reduce risk include suspending all international travel and limiting non-essential domestic travel; reducing large customer events and gatherings; and emphasizing health and hygiene across all office locations — “by maintaining sanitation supplies and encouraging an ‘if you are sick, stay home’ mindset”.
It also says it’s conducting all new hire orientation and candidate interviews virtually.
Box names a number of tools it says it routinely uses to support mobility and remote working, including its own service for secure content collaboration; Zoom’s video communication tool; the Slack messaging app; Okta for secure ID; plus additional unnamed “critical cloud tools” for ensuring “uninterrupted remote work for all employees”.
Clearly spying the opportunity to onboard new users, as more companies switch on remote working as a result of COVID-19 concerns, Box’s post also links to free training resources for its own cloud computing tools."

GM’s luxury brand had planned to reveal the Lyriq on April 2 at an event in Los Angeles.
COVID-19, a disease caused by a new virus that is a member of the coronavirus family and a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past, has caused governments and companies to cancel tech, business and automotive events around the world. The Geneva International Motor Show was canceled as well as MWC in Barcelona and the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.
The GM brand said in a statement that the event was being canceled “out of an abundance of caution.”
Here’s the statement from Cadillac:
As you are aware, the situation in relation to the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) outbreak in the U.S. continues to develop. Now, several states have declared a State of Emergency and the number of cases continues to climb.
Out of an abundance of caution, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the Cadillac LYRIQ reveal in Los Angeles, California on April 2nd.  We are currently evaluating future plans and will be touch soon with an update.  Our top priority is the safety of our media guests and employees. We have been working with GM Medical and Security to monitor the situation closely and have been following recommendations for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.
The Lyriq is just one in a roster of electric vehicles that GM plans to bring to market in the next two years. The automaker revealed March 4 a sweeping plan to produce and sell EVs that hinges on a new electric architecture that will support a wide range of products across all of its brands, including Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. The EV portfolio will include everything from compact cars and work trucks to large premium SUVs and performance vehicles.
This modular architecture, called Ultium, will be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front-, rear- and all-wheel drive configurations.
The Cruise Origin, a self-driving, electric shared vehicle that was shown in January, was the first product under this new EV strategy to be revealed to the public. The reveal of Cadillac Lyriq SUV was supposed to come next, followed by the GMC Hummer EV on May 20. The Hummer event has not been cancelled."

We looked at many different options and scenarios and took as many preventive measures as possible to reduce the impact of the virus. Given the unknown timeline and current economic situation, we were forced to cut back in this way to elongate the trajectory of Bird and our mission.  As you know, we just raised hundreds of millions from investors, but given all the uncertainty, we needed to ensure a cash runway to last through the end of 2021.

As we all know: yes, the world has changed and continues to change. This will be a difficult season, but we continue to work around the clock to move us forward as a team. As mentioned last week, were aggressively shoring up resources and protecting our existing assets. Weve curbed all spending company-wide that is not directly related to helping us weather this storm together. We appreciate all your help identifying unnecessary spend during this down time.
History also tells us something important: micromobility, especially scooters, will very likely have an important role to play as communities begin to get moving again in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This is not the first time that a public health crisis has had a direct impact on the micromobility industry. When the SARS outbreak was sweeping through China, e-bike sales surged as riders looked for more personalized alternatives to public transit.
History suggests that people will demand a large scale mobility option that still allows for personal distancing. And Bird will be there, working hand in hand with cities to help communities heal, and help riders regain mobility, in the wake of the most serious global pandemic in recent memory.
I just want to give a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has rallied to keep up with such a rapidly changing situation. Well try to keep everyone informed as it relates to changing priorities and business impact. Weve had successes that allow businesses to persevere in times of uncertainty and, with your trust, patience and determination, we will overcome the challenges we face today as well.
Lean on each other. Over communicate. Support each other. Reach out to your teammates and managers to understand what you can do to keep us moving forward.

Existing tools are useful, but come from fairly specialized sources including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University. This new initiative combines data fro these same sources, including global confirmed reported COVID-19 cases, as well as reported data from sources at both the state and county level. This is collected on a so-called “incident map” that displays color-coded reported case data for states and counties, as well as on state-wide trend graphs and through reporting of stats including relative percentage increase of cases week-over-week.
On top of these sections built into the core, consumer-facing Weather.com products, IBM has also launched a more in-depth analytics reporting dashboard, providing views of global reported COVID-19 cases, as well as rate of spread based on available data, county-by-county stats and more.
This information from IBM, which runs on its Watson and Cognos Analytics tools, are intended for use by both researchers and public officials but they’re also meant for general public consumption. IBM is also providing resources including fact-checking resources and practical guidance for both COVID-19 patients and the general public, to help not only inform people about the spread of the virus, but also the steps they can take to protect themselves and others.
One of the key elements of COVID-19 mitigation is making sure that the average American has access to reliable and accurate information, including the most up-to-date guidelines about social distancing and isolation from trusted experts including the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That makes this a key resource in the ongoing efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus, since it resides in an app that is among the most popular pieces of software available for smartphones. There are around 45 million or so monthly active users of the Weather Channel app, which means that this information will now be readily accessible by a large percentage of the U.S. population."

However, while I believe we did the right thing in prioritizing health and safety, Im sorry that we communicated this decision to guests without consulting youlike partners should. We have heard from you and we know we could have been better partners.”
Beyond that, Airbnb is creating a $10 million fund for its superhosts and experience hosts. Employees contributed the first $1 million and Airbnb co-founders Joe Gebbia, Brian Chesky and Nate Blecharczyk are personally providing the other $9 million.

Yelp, Funding Circle, StubHub and other companies have terminated their internship programs and hiring, citing the uncertainty of COVID-19s impact on the economy and health. Others programs are in flux, and some are honoring programs and moving remote.
Cancellations show the viruss impact on not just our current workforce, but our future one, too. For students entering a workforce at a potential economic downturn, the funnel into new jobs becomes especially important.
While Cloudflares internship program is traditionally finalized by late fall, Prince says that a flurry of emails came in from worried students once the pandemic hit the U.S: Will the internship be canceled? Will they be moving remote? How will start dates work? And what about that flight to San Francisco for on-boarding?
Keeping the program was a no brainer says Prince, but he said he made the decision to double the programs size when he saw Ismyinternshipcanceled.com and TechCrunchs coverage that cancellations were happening across the country.  
Every company is in a different position. And if this had been a banking crisis, or this has been an agricultural crisis, there wouldn’t be that much that CloudFlare could do, Prince said. But because this has been a crisis that’s forced us all to rely more on the internet, that is our business at Cloudflare.
Now, Cloudflares program will include roughly 100 students with one mentor dedicated to each student. After reaching out to the employees to see who would volunteer to mentor, CloudFlare was able to increase the team size.
The other reason that Prince is open to allowing remote interns is because his remote staff is currently at a high level of productivity. That proven success gave him confidence to recreate the experience regardless of where the student is based.
The hires will be across nearly every department, with a focus on bringing on more engineers.
Prince does, however, recognize that the uptick can potentially create a difficult learning environment for students looking for a close-knit employment experience.
Another downside is that the company usually flies new hires over to San Francisco for on-boarding, and that will now be done remotely. And, at the end of the summer, the entire company convenes for an intern presentation. While the presentation will take place, with double the people and no place to host, they will look different.
Prince is calling on other companies in financially stable situations to increase intern headcount, as well. He said hes game to collaborate with other internship trackers, like IsMyInternshipCanceled.com, to pass on worthy resumes once Cloudflare fills its summer cohort.
The strongest teams are the most diverse teams, and I think that for us the silver lining of this remote work is that it has opened up our ability to maybe select some interns that wouldnt have been willing to move to SF, or Austin, or London, or Lisbon, he said.
The worst experience if you’ve ever had an internship is that you got lost or forgotten about, he said. So the real limiting factor for us is to find people that can serve mentorship positions.
The world is running effectively the biggest work from home experiment, Prince said. Its going to be an experiment for us, and hopefully a great experience for interns as well.
And of course, if COVID-19 is no longer a threat come summer, Prince says that students will have the option to work remotely or come to San Francisco.
More broadly, Cloudflare has no plans for layoffs and is continuing to hire through the pandemic.
Cloudflare, which debuted on the public market in September, launched soon after the financial crisis of 2008. Prince had run out of money and asked his mother for loans. Michelle Zatlyn, the co-founder of Cloudflare, was part of one of the few Google internship classes that didnt get return offers.
So, with few options, Zatlyn and Prince worked on a school project together in business school. Their project ended up becoming Cloudflare, and their other classmates went on to found Thredup and Rent the Runway.
For the co-founders, options drying up was part of the founding story of what is now a billion-dollar business. So when it came to seeing other interns in the same place, Cloudflare felt right at home to help."

COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has prompted governments to issue stay at home orders that triggered a wave of cancellations in the travel and hospitality industries.
“While the current environment is clearly a difficult one for the hospitality industry, the desire to travel and have authentic experiences is fundamental and enduring,” Silver Lake Co-CEO and Managing Partner Egon Durban said in a statement. “Airbnbs diverse, global, and resilient business model is particularly well suited to prosper as the world inevitably recovers and we all get back out to experience it.
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky acknowledged Monday that while the desire to connect and travel has been reinforced during this time, the “way it manifests will evolve as the world changes.”
The expectation of this evolution has spurred Airbnb to direct its attention and new funds towards three core products: hosts, long-term stays and Airbnb experiences.
Last month, Airbnb said it would direct $250 million to help hosts who have been impacted by COVID-19. The funds will be used to pay a host 25% of what they would normally receive through their cancellation policy if a guest cancels a reservation due to COVID-19 between March 14 and May 31. Airbnb said this policy applies retroactively to all cancellations during that period.
The move was an attempt by Airbnb to make amends to its hosts who complained that the company’s policy would allow guests to cancel reservations and receive a full refund.

GE Healthcare had originally intended to debut its Mural Virtual Care Solution at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society meeting earlier this year. When the COVID-19 epidemic scuttled those plans the company went redesigned the software offering — initially intended to be a new feature for its Edison platform — to focus on a COVID-19 application that could be distributed quickly to hospitals that need it using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud.
GE Healthcare and Microsoft are waiving everything but the installation costs for the software until January 2021, the companies said.
The software is designed to provide a central hub from which hospital staff can monitor patients in intensive care units — including those on medical ventilation.
As Dr. David Rhew, the chief global medical officer of Microsoft noted, the remote monitoring tools could help hospital staff limit their exposure to infected patients and help conserve needed personal protective equipment.
“If you think about what the solution was originally built on it was built on an on-prem solution that would take weeks to install and would take time to set up the servers,” said Rhew. “It clearly is a great way for us to more efficiently monitor… [And] because you dont need to walk into the room it saves PPE decreasing that risk of exposure.” 
A Mural installation can monitor a 100-bed, multi-site ICU network with just three senior nurses and two intensivists, according to a company statement. The software collects real-time data from ventilators, existing patient monitoring systems, electronic medical records, labs and other diagnostics into a single surveillance hub, the companies said.
Facing the daunting outlook of a COVID-19 surge, it is imperative that I and my fellow healthcare workers use virtual ICU technology to safely monitor and care for our sickest patients while preserving PPE, said Matthias Merkel, M.D., Ph.D., OHSUs Chief Medical Capacity Officer, Vice Chair of Critical Care Medicine, and Professor of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, in a statement. Remaining closely connected and supported through technology enables us to progress our patients care across a geographic distance that we would otherwise be unable to manage."

Basically, that means using the liquid component of blood from people who have had, and already recovered fully from COVID-19 to produce treatments that hopefully translate the antibodies they developed over the course of fighting off the virus to others. The FDA has created a dedicated new website seeking recovered COVID-19 donations, and explaining its potential uses.
Use of convalescent plasma is hardly a new concept: It’s been in use since the late 1890s, in fact, and was employed during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, albeit with “mixed results.” Modern methods could help improve the efficacy and potential of recovered plasma as a treatment method, and there are a number of drugs in development that use plasma (both animal and human) as the basic active ingredient of their approach.
The new FDA website around COVID-19 plasma donation defines what it is, and why it’s under investigation as a possible treatment. It also outlines what conditions need to be met in order for an individual to be qualified to donate (no symptoms for at least 28 days prior to donation, or at least 14 days when combined with a confirmed negative lab test for active COVID-19 viral presence), and it directs you to donate via an American Red Cross or local blood center nearby.
Why is so much COVID-19 patient plasma needed, if it’s not yet even proven to be effective in treatment of the virus? Mainly because there are a lot of efforts underway to determine whether it actually can help with efforts to combat the virus, including clinical trials for a number of different treatments, as well as single-patient treatment authorizations through what are known as emergency investigational new drug (eIND) one-off usage approvals from the FDA.
As with every potential treatment and vaccine in development to address COVID-19 at this stage, recovered plasma remains unproven, and it’s unlikely ongoing efforts to study its effectiveness will bear definitive proof one way or another in the near term. Still, there’s a growing need for plasma supplies to help further that work, hence the FDA’s decision to spur more donations with dedicated informational resources like this one."

For the first time since the gig economy has become a household term, around 2009 or so, legislators are thinking very actively that the benefits being provided are not just going to employees but also self-employed individuals and those who are part of the gig economy, he says. Thats an important evolution.
There have been previous attempts at so-called portable benefits, which are tied to individuals rather than the corporations they work for. In 2018, the National Domestic Workers Alliance piloted Alia, a program that pools voluntary contributions from clients that cleaners can then redeem for disability insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, or paid time off. Clients make small, recurring paymentsthe recommended amount is about $5 per house cleaningand workers can access their accrued funds in an online dashboard.
Shah says there hasnt been much urgency around providing these benefits until very recently. Now, as more platforms for portable benefits are emerging, it will be important for them to use the momentum to catch on. With the coronavirus crisis, I think were going to see public opinion change very quickly, says Shah. A large part of what we needed was visibility. We have that now.
Legislation has started to emerge that would address some of those needs. Senator Mark Warner reintroduced a bill in February that would earmark $20 million for states and nonprofits to offer benefits like workers' comp, disability coverage, and retirement savings to people without traditional employers. Coronavirus is underscoring how vulnerable some American workers are without access to a safety net, Warner tweeted. This crisis is demonstrating why we need a portable benefits system for gig workers, independent contractors, and other contingent workers. And in May, Philadelphia will become the first city in the country to pilot its own portable benefits program, which affords domestic workers up to 40 hours of paid time off each year.
And while companies remain unlikely to offer benefits freely, some gig workers find themselves with more leverage than ever. In March, Instacart announced that it would hire 300,000 more shoppers to meet demand. Workers were able to secure better treatment, including the promise of protective supplies like masks and hand sanitizers and a higher raised tip amount. Workers for Shipt, a Target-owned grocery delivery company, followed suit this week with a similar strike.
It is significant that youre seeing more of that type of activism in this moment than weve seen in the past, says Fitzpayne. Workers are feeling that theyre in a strong enough position to make those types of requests.
Still, even if Instacart met all of the demands of its workers, it wouldnt do much for the millions of other workers with similar types of jobs. If you're giving them benefits while preserving these illegal business models, then you're allowing employers to get away with not providing protections to workers that are due, says Larry Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute. Some states are pushing for companies to reclassify their workers as employees, not contractors. California recently passed legislation that defines Uber drivers, DoorDash delivery workers, and similar roles as employees; in New York, a court recently ruled that Postmates workers cannot be classified as independent contractors. Those companies are aggressively pushing back.
The coronavirus crisis may divert attention away from those recent regulatory decisions, but Fitzpayne argues that long-term change will ultimately require legislation. We're seeing temporary solutions, but that invites the broader question, says Fitzpayne. Are we going to be able, as a country, to take some of these temporary solutions and make them more permanent?
If that push for more durable solutions doesnt happen now, while public sympathies for gig workers are exceedingly high, then it may never happen at all."

Thats one way to interpret some very recent research into how political partisanship has been affecting social behavior in response to the pandemic. For the latest study on this topic, a group of economists led by Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow used cell phone location data gathered across the U.S. from the end of January to early April to measure the extent to which people had limited their trips to stores, restaurants, hotels and other public gathering spots. Then they matched up those changes of behavior, at the county level, with vote shares in the last presidential election. The groups new working paper, posted Monday, describes the major finding: the more decisively a county went for Donald Trump in 2016, the less its residents have been hiding out from public spaces.
Thats true even controlling for local case numbers, population density, and the timing of statewide social-distancing instructions. In Pulaski County, Kentucky, for examplewhere 82 percent of voters backed Trump in 2016residents reduced their visits to so-called points of interest by 51 percent over the duration of the study. In contrast, demographically similar Washington County, Vermontwhere Hillary Clinton won by a huge marginsaw trips decline by 71 percent. Both counties had registered only a handful of confirmed cases, while their state governments issued stay-at-home orders on March 26 and March 25, respectively.
The pandemic has played out differently in red and blue America from the start. In early March, polling data showed a wide gulf between how seriously Democrats and Republicans took the threat. Trump had been downplaying the severity of the outbreak for weeks, and his boosters at Fox News were pushing the same message. That appeared to explain the divergence in public opinion, but the role of geography couldnt be ruled out. The disease began its assault on American soil in some of the most Democratic areas of the country: Seattle, New York City, San Francisco. The partisan divide in perceived risk could have been nothing more than a reflection of the partisan divide in peoples actual risk.
The geography theory quickly started to weaken, however. As the virus spread, and Trump backed off his denialism, Republican levels of concern began increasing, but still lagged behind Democrats. Another working paper, posted in late March, found that political differences are the single most consistent factor behind the divergent attitudes and self-reported behaviors around social distancing, controlling for state-by-state differences in Covid-19 deaths and diagnoses.
That research had a key limitation, though. It was based on survey data, not real-word behavior. Perhaps Republicans and Democrats were acting in similar ways, even as they fed pollsters different answers about their commitment to hand-washing and aversion to large gatherings. After all, people say one thing and do another all the time.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
A pair of newer studiesthe one from Allcott and Gentzkows team, plus another working paper by John Barrios and Yael V. Hochberg that posted March 27took advantage of GPS tracking data to get around the problem of unreliable self-reporting. The papers differ slightly in their methodology, and use different location data sets, but their core finding is the same: Democrats and Republicans dont just say different things about the coronavirus; they appear to be acting on their beliefs. Basically, the more Trump voters there are [in a county], the less people reduce the distance traveled and the less they reduce the visits to non-essential businesses, Hochberg told me.
Both groups of researchers attribute the partisan behavior gap to different beliefs about the severity of the pandemic, stemming from exposure to and trust in different information sources. The two studies measured that in different ways. Allcot and Gentzkows team conducted a survey of 2,000 adults at the beginning of April, showing, among other things, that Democrats predicted a higher number of future Covid-19 cases and a higher risk of infection than Republicans. Barrios and Hochberg, meanwhile, found that Republican areas started catching up in social distancing after reports of infections at the Conservative Political Action Conference and the shift in Trumps rhetoric in mid-March.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
The behavioral differences identified in the cell-phone tracking studies are significant but not enormous: According to Alcott and Gentzkows team, people in the most pro-Trump counties had reduced their visits to points of interest by 44 percent by the end of March, as compared to 62 percent for people in the least Trump-y places. We still dont know, and may never know, which of these numbers is more correct, or how they relate to the optimal tradeoff between maintaining public health and preserving economic activity. One needs to be careful in looking at these gaps and saying, this means that Democrats are doing something good and Republicans are doing something bad, said Gentzkow."

But older research conducted on the SARS-CoV-2 virus genetic relative, the coronavirus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, lends some clues. It also ravaged adults more than children. That global outbreak killed 774 people, or about one in 10 of those SARS infected. Not a single person under the age of 24 died.
In severe cases of SARS, a patient would initially have a fever and cough while the virus was rapidly replicating in their lungs. About a week later, theyd spontaneously improve, as their immune system kicked in. But then a second phase of the disease would start, which would be much worse than the first. One study by researchers at the University of Hong Kong focusing on 75 SARS patients found that the second stage, the one that often led to death, wasnt caused by the virus at all, but by patients runaway immune systems. For reasons that still arent clear, some people, especially the old and sick, werent able to turn off their inflammatory response, leading immune cells and inflammation-inducing molecules known as cytokines to flood into the lungs. This so-called cytokine storm caused the most severe symptoms of the disease: pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and organ damage.
These cytokines are supposed to help the immune system clear the virus, but in the people that did poorly the response was overly exuberant, causing more damage than the virus itself, says Stanley Perlman, a virologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa.
Covid-19 appears to have some similarities, so doctors have wondered if limiting this inflammation would be helpful. In one of the first studies of Covid-19 patients, doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Hubei reported that nearly half received steroids, which tamp down an immune response. Though the studys ability to assess outcomes was limited, the authors reported that no treatments proved effective.
Perlman says scientists still dont know exactly why some people respond this way. But in studies with mice, his lab discovered that as animals age, their lungs take on damage that leads to structural changes that make them more susceptible to coronavirus infections. With SARS in particular, the older the mice, the sicker they got. We know the lung environment really matters with this class of respiratory viruses, says Perlman. As people age, that lung environment changes. It gets pelted with pollen and pollution and the body responds with inflammation. A history of inflammation may impact how well you do with coronaviruses.
More research is needed, but its a plausible explanation for Covid-19s mild symptoms in children, says Creech. The non-inflamed lung is a much less hospitable place for any virus to land, he says. The next step would be to look at how children with less pristine lungs are faring in the outbreaklike kids with a history of asthma or babies who are born prematurely and lack a substance that helps keep open the tiny sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen. If these kids experience severe Covid-19 symptoms too, then the pristine lung hypothesis holds up.
Another (highly speculative) possibility, says Creech, is that somehow kids may be leveraging their previous immune responses to the cold-causing coronaviruses theyre constantly being assaulted with. Each of us is a little different in how we can modify the tips of our antibodies to latch on to foreign invaders, says Creech. Its possible that recent coronavirus exposure in kids has led to the emergence of antibodies that have some cross-reactivity with the virus that causes Covid-19. But, he stresses, so far theres no evidence thats whats going on."

The playbook here is all too familiar.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-analogy-between-covid-19-and-climate-change-is-eerily-precise/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e7ba5188283f9000a41518c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Ideas-COVID-Climat-1207216812.jpg",2020-03-25T18:59:54Z,"For a brief moment there, it looked as though the coronavirus pandemic might escape the muck of partisanship. 
Its true that Donald Trump, wary of a recession during a reelection year, had first tried to talk the virus into submission. His counterfactual insistence that the situation was under control did nothing to slow the viral spread through February and early March. It did, however, seem to influence the party faithful, as polls showed Republican voters were taking the pandemic far less seriously than Democrats. In other words, the facts of Covid-19 were already politicized. As I suggested last week, it looked as though this process were unfolding just as it had for climate changebut at 1000x speed.
Then Trump began to shift his message. Suddenly he seemed to grasp the need for drastic measures (while claiming that hed never hinted otherwise). The White House started repeating the advice from public health experts: Social distancing would be necessary, maybe through the end of summer. In my last piece I wondered if this new acceptance of reality might keep an epistemic crisis from developing. Perhaps Americans would coalesce into a common understanding of this public-health disaster.
But coronavirus denialism wasnt in remission; it was only mutating. After a weekend of reported clashes among economic and health officials in the White House, and a spate of skeptical op-eds musing on whether social distancing was really worth its economic cost, Trump laid out a new approach by presidential tweet: WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.
By Monday evening, Trump was promising to wrap up social distancing in weeks, not months. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter, he declared yesterday, during a virtual town hall on Fox News. Meanwhile, a rising chorus of Trump followers have been suggesting that some folks will simply have to die to save the economy. Let's get back to living, Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. And those of us who are 70-plus, we'll take care of ourselves. But don't sacrifice the country. Jerry Falwell Jr.s Liberty University announced that its expecting students and faculty to return from spring break. Even if we all get sick, I would rather die than kill the country, said right-wing talk host Glenn Beck. Because its not the economy thats dying, its the country.
The parallel to climate change, in other words, was even tighter than I realized.
We went through the stages of climate change denial in the matter of a week, said Gordon Pennycook, a psychologist at the University of Regina who studies how misinformation spreads. Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science who has studied the origins of climate disinformation, spelled out the pattern in an email: First, one denies the problem, then one denies its severity, and then one says it is too difficult or expensive to fix and/or that the proposed solution threatens our freedom.
These strategies, Oreskes explained, can exist side by side, depending on the context. The crudest skeptics, like the snowball-wielding Jim Inhofe, still deny the phenomenon itself: no, humans arent warming the Earthlook how cold it is outside! More sophisticated players, confronting a tidal wave of scientific data, may accept that the Earth is warming; but they argue that the ill effects are overstated and incommensurate with the costs of aggressive action. As a Wall Street Journal op-ed from 2017 put it, the economic damage one might expect from climate change does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth.
Now were faced with the threat of another global catastrophe arising from the clash of nature and modern human activity. As with climate change, the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic are difficult to predict with confidence. As with climate change, the uncertainty interval encompasses utter cataclysm. As with climate change, any serious effort to mitigate or stave off this disaster will require major economic disruptions. And, as with climate change, such efforts to save the world must be put in place before any of the experts doomsday warnings could ever be proved true.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
So we see the same pattern of skeptical response from Republican elites. Whether its driven by self-interest (corporate profits, a presidents hopes of reelection) or by small-government ideology, the approach sends a powerful signal to the partys voters. If you take this problem seriously, you must be one of them, not us."

We asked pediatric infectious disease experts for advice and hand-holding.,https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-parents-caregiving-guide/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e73f614a231050008135f87/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Gear-Sick-Parent-1206673833.jpg",2020-03-22T11:00:00Z,"This is a risk-balance issue, said Dr. Nolt. If you are mildly sick, who is going to take care of the kids in your home? The risk of transmitting an infection to a child is not going to result in a whole lot, because kids do well. But if you are sick and have an older household member, that might tip the issue of isolation differently.
Another bonus? Infections within a family home are usually staggered, which can help, noted Dr. Roshni Mathew, pediatric infectious disease specialist at Stanford Childrens Health and clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford School of Medicine. Even if you do transmit the infection to your partner, it will come after yours has receded.
The parent who is further along in the course of the illness could take on the primary caregiver role for the children to help minimize the chance of transmission, said Dr. Mathew. Its important to remember that the risk of transmission is highest in the first few days of illness, when the symptoms are more pronounced.
Not everyone has a second home if they get sick. But no matter how tempting, none of the experts we talked to recommended retreating to a hotel or an Airbnb. Asking those that are SARS-CoV-2 positive to be quarantined in an Airbnb or hotel is not up for debate right now, as our efforts are focused on social distancing and staying at home as much as possible, said Dr. Soni. Hotels and other venues like this are still considered public places and could significantly increase spread.
There are plenty of smart ways to clean and disinfect your home, but you dont need to go nuts. If your spouse is quarantining in the bedroom, you dont need to wear gloves and dump his contaminated soup bowl into a vat of boiling bleach. We dont want you doing disposable trays or anything like that, said Nolt. We know this virus is very easily cleaned by household cleaners. You dont have to mix your own detergents or buy anything super strong.
The important exception is the bathroom. Several studies have come out regarding the role of feco-oral transmission of this virus, in addition to respiratory droplets, said Dr. Soni. In other words, when he uses the bathroom, your sick loved one is shedding virus in the form of gross flying poop particles.
If a separate bathroom isnt possible, all the experts we consulted suggested to wipe down your bathroom every day, and especially after the sick person has used italong with putting disinfectant in the toilet bowl, and wiping down high-touch surfaces like the faucet handles and toilet handles with disinfectant. And make sure your sick loved one closes the toilet bowl lid and washes his hands.
When you flush the toilet, theres an aerosol thats generated, a splashing of water out of the toilet, and that may contain virus. So you know its important to keep toothbrushes and so forth away from the toilet. [Everyone should] close the lid when they flush the toilet, said Dr. John M. Townes, the medical director of infection prevention and control at OHSU Healthcare. And wash their hands after going to the bathroom, for sure.
Nolt also made one last important point: The best way to prevent both parents from falling ill is to take care of themselves. Many of us are adjusting to new routines and new realities, of becoming full-time work-from-home employees as well as full-time caregivers.
Its easy to let things like eating well, exercising, decreasing our stress, and getting enough sleep fall by the wayside when were coping with a dozen new and different demands on our time and energy. If you find yourself getting the urge to finish one last work assignment or do one more load of laundry ... don't. It's now a public service to make sure that we stay healthy and able to take care of our kids and each other."

But unless youre actually fighting an outbreak, or are in one, that can all feel academic. If the exponential liftoff is happening somewhere else, its not happening to you. Add to that peculiar form of emotional distancing a heavy dose of disinformation and partisanship, and depending on where you live and what your information diet is like, even the Covid-19 pandemic could start to seem almost unreal.
In a crisis, health communication experts agree, different kinds of people need to hear different kinds of narratives about whats going on. Broadly, truthful information delivered clearly and without panicbut also without undue optimismis the way to maintain credibility. But some people in the audience need a more emotional connection to fully engage. According to survey data from the Pew Research Center, nine out of 10 Americans say that Covid-19 has affected their lives in some way. But that means 10 percent of Americans say it hasnt. Pew also finds that almost 80 percent of Fox News viewers think the media has exaggerated the threat of the virus (we havent) and 7 percent of people arent really following the news about it at all. Even President Trump seems to think that only people who sadly lost a family member or friend will even remember Covid-19 when its all over. These numbers are fast-changing, but still, watching the pandemic unfold as news from a distant city or as lines and numbers on charts might be very different than being in a hotspot, or knowing someone who dies from the disease.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
That raises a grim question: Whatll it take before everyone personally knows someone who died from Covid-19? As of this writing, more than 11,800 people have died from it in the United States. (And that death toll may be an undercount.) If knowing one of those people would make the pandemic concrete for someonereal and actionablehow many have to die before every American knows one of the dead?
In a time of relentlessly cold equations, this one may be the coldest. It also turns out to be hard to solve.
The easiest answer, the back-of-the-envelope sketch, requires figuring out how many people anyone in the US is likely to know. Take one death from a group of that size, then multiply whatever percentage that is by the total US population. So, for example, one readily-accepted count of how many people any one person knows comes from a rigorous analysis of Facebook data from 2011. Its about 200. Using this rough metric, if 1 in every 200 Americans dies from Covid-19a fatality rate of 0.5 percenteveryone in the US will know someone who has perished. With a national population of 327.2 million, thats 1.6 million US deaths.
But we get into the weeds right away. Is 200 right? A 2006 paper using survey data and statistical models to calculate the number of people the average person knows arrived at 750. The Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman, one of the authors of that paper, came back in 2013 with another estimate based on a different survey: 600.
Our analysis from 2011 was about Facebook friends, where the average was 200ish, says Johan Ugander, a Stanford professor of management science and co-author of the 200-count paper. He notes that the median number of Facebook friends was only 99, which means that half of all people had fewer than 99 friends. If you use that number, it would take an American death count of 3.3 million before everyone in the US lost someone they knew. Of course, all this depends on your definition of friend. If you switch to looser notions of know someone, you can quickly get numbers like 750, Ugander says. Its reasonable to think of friendship tie strength as an onion with many layers,
Princeton mathematician Chris Sims used one of those larger numbersGelmans estimate of 600and calculations of Covid-19s prevalence and fatality rate that were operative in late March, for a related calculation. He wrote that if the disease kills slightly less than 1 percent of everyone who gets it, and about 60 percent of a population gets infected, a person who knows 600 people has a 95 percent chance of knowing someone who will die of the disease. Or to put it another way, if 1 in 600 people die, that means the US will have about 546,000 deathsscarily, not much more than twice the best-case range estimated by the White House, though the president and his advisors havent been clear on exactly how they arrived at their numbers.
Now the weeds get even thickereven if, for simplicitys sake, we stick with 1-in-200 as our ratio. Covid death is unlikely to be uniform or random, Ugander says. We can expect people with more friends to be more likely to be exposed, and then also die, and expect there to be clustering in the deaths on the network, for all sorts of reasons.
This relates to a statistical concept known as the friendship paradoxin your network, your friends probably have more friends than you. Thats not an insult; some people are nodes, the extroverted superspreaders of bonhomie, so theyre shared across multiple networks. Dont be too jealous of these social butterflies. Their centrality, their internodal connectedness, has a price. Because they come into physical contact with more people, theyre more likely to get infected during an epidemic."

I’m lucky in that my part of the city is famously packed with excellent coffee shops, but in the time I’ve lived here I’ve seen them grow increasingly packed with well, people like me. Some days they seem more like co-working spaces than cafes and this is something business owners and neighborhoods are going to need to acknowledge one way or the other.
Most urban and suburban American communities were formed around the convention of commuting, which means fewer work-related resources where people live. Instead, we have all the restaurants, bodegas, thrift stores and all the other things that cater to people who aren’t working."

According to several metrics TechCrunch has tracked throughout the COVID-19 era, the fortunes of some startups appear to have bounced off lows set in March and April. Data concerning layoffs, and, more specifically, software revenue and customer losses indicate that many firms have stopped making aggressive staffing cuts and are shedding fewer customers than earlier in the pandemic.
These two signals don’t sum up the entire startup market. But while TechCrunch has spent time in recent days parsing surveyed sentiment and reported observations from founders and private-market investors alike, studying layoffs and churn should help sharpen some of the blurred edges in our view of the current landscape.

After we dig through the new information, we’ll check in with Bessemer growth-stage investor Elliott Robinson to compare our findings with what he’s seeing in the later stages of the venture market.
Health amongst growth-oriented private firms varies greatly from company to company, often hinging on sector served; for example, upstart software companies that sell to the travel industry may still need to layoff staff despite improving performance amongst their general business model cohort.
And not all startups sell software, even though the software-as-a-service model has become one of the most popular for high-growth private companies approaching the market. This means any single perspective on a startup group, or all startups, will necessarily miss nuance. But a general picture is better than no perspective at all, so we’ll proceed all the same; let’s begin with layoffs.

Taiwan had linked its immigration database to its national health system. Singapore had instituted harsh fines for anyone breaking social distancing and published detailed data on every case and cluster. The problem is, you dont pick up every single person, especially when the people with mild symptoms know if they get tested theyre going to be isolated, and their friends and family are going to be isolated, says Cowling. Theres a disincentive. Thats especially bad with Covid-19, which seems to spread in part because of a few days of pre-symptomatic infectiousness before the onset of heavy illness.
Other nations couldnt hold containment, or didnt try. In Europe and the United States, governments dithered about whether and when to institute draconian but necessary measures like social distancing, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders. Now those same governments and public health researchers have to figure out how long to maintain them. Theyre destructive to peoples psyches and the economy, but letting people swirl back into close contact with one another allows the disease to spread again.
In epidemiological terms, this tension is about taking control of whats called the reproductive number, the number of people a contagious person goes on to infect. At the top of the curve in Wuhan, where Covid-19 started to spread, that number was something like 2 or 2.5as it might now be in parts of the US and Europe. After the Chinese government quarantined Wuhan and forced everyone to stay home, it went down to perhaps as low as 0.3. In China, those rules went into effect in January; the government may lift them this week.
The viruss apparent return will spur different kinds of containment measures in different places. Hong Kongs were already strict, though theyd relaxed somewhat in the first weeks of March. Now, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan have all instituted even stricter social distancing rules and immigration controls. Nationals who are allowed in can expect 14-day quarantines, in Hong Kong and Singapore monitored by smartphone app, though those apps efficacy may be doubtful. (Singapores numbers do seem to look better since officials started quarantining everyone coming in, rather than people from specific countries.) Singapore is also closing all schools and most workplaces.
Despite the resurgences, these places are all still roughly in the containment phase of dealing with the pandemic, tracing individual cases and contactsor some transitional phase that combines containment and the next step, mitigation, including social distancing measures, school and workplace closures, and canceling mass gatherings. The US and Europe are well into mitigation, riding the exponential curve upward. Right now theyre in different parts of the graph, Wang says. When its near the peak, and you have to manage it, you start to do as much of the mitigation strategy as possible, so you flatten the curve. Then you try to wait and see where you are, and if you lift it too early, you get a resurgence.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
For the US, thats a scary warning. The peak numbers could be terrifying, and theyll certainly vary across hot spots. But once the peak is passed? Hundreds of millions of people cant stay socially distanced forever. Despite the new cases, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are still keeping their reproductive numbers around 1a slow enough spread to follow cases and contain flare-ups. That may be the long-term strategy for the US and Europe, Cowling says. Theres two approaches, maybe. One is test, test, test. Identify cases, isolate them, stop transmission of them into the community. But its always difficult to catch every infection, especially the mild ones. So the other approach that is necessary, really important, is to maintain some social distancing."

The changes afoot are holistic, transformative and a long time coming. These changes will extend to recruiting, training and, ultimately, how employers fundamentally go about finding potential candidates for their organizations. It also will change the very nature of higher education itself.
Before COVID-19, would-be employees would take traditional educational routes to gain employment. High school led to college which (sometimes) led to grad school. Almost all of this was done in an immersive campus setting where students tried to figure out not only who they were but what they wanted to do and with whom they wanted to do it. This path required enterprises to react specifically to an entrenched educational model that determined how would-be employees would be groomed and trained — be it for a specific skill set or cultural fit — all in an effort to determine who the right person was for them.
This model has grown bloated over the years, and the industry that supports it projected to register $10 trillion globally by 2030 has become increasingly vulnerable to the kind of technology-driven change that, over the last decade, has been disrupting old-school industries across the board, from retail to logistics to real estate and more.
“A reckoning is coming for schools and universities,” Scott Galloway, a professor of Marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business, told CNN in late May. “Weve raised prices 1400% but at the same time if you look at innovation…if you walked into a classroom today it wouldnt look, smell or feel much different from what it did 40 years ago.”
In a blog post from April, Galloway further projected that COVID-19 would lead to a culling among universities. As with retail, he suggested where closures skyrocketed from 9,500 stores in 2019 to more than 15,000 in 2020 there will likely be dozens, if not hundreds, of colleges and universities that simply do not recover from the virus. He also predicted a sustained drop in applications at four-year universities for the first time in decades.
“The blow to the world of higher education was bound to come,” said Roei Deutsch, co-founder and CEO of live video course marketplace Jolt Inc. during a talk on the podcast, Coffee Break. “There is a higher education bubble, something there does not work in terms of cost versus what students receive in return, and you can say that the coronavirus crisis is the beginning of this bubbles bursting.”
While the virus may hasten an overdue transformation in higher education, it also will create opportunities for startups that create alternatives to traditional higher education. As with many other sectors, though, this will be less about COVID-19 acting as a radical change agent and more about the virus accelerating what was already taking place behind the scenes, primarily within global enterprises.
Over the last decade, enterprise learning and development (L&amp;D) has grown in importance as various technologies proliferated throughout large organizations. The global corporate e-learning market is estimated to grow up to $30 billion at a 13% compound annual growth rate through 2022. This growth was driven in large part by the increased importance of matching workforce capabilities with actual required skill sets.
Learning experience platforms (LXP) and learning management systems (LMS) are core products used by enterprises in L&amp;D. They are used to monitor, track and administer employment learning activities. They usually serve as digitized online catalogs. Learning software is primarily designed to create more personalized learning experiences and help users discover new learning opportunities by combining learning content from different sources, while recommending and delivering them with the support of AI across multiple digital touch points, e.g. desktop applications, mobile learning apps and others.
Significantly, these same online education tools have also begun to be adopted by many colleges and universities as they look for ways to cope with COVID-19. This is helping to transform thinking around these applications, tools and platforms. Enterprises, which had already been adopting these tools, are now reconsidering their potential. It does not take a colossal leap of imagination to see what lies ahead.
Instead of building training academies and LMS systems to help continually train people for new or expanded roles within an organization, enterprises will now target the front end of the recruiting funnel where higher education begins. With university life transformed by COVID-19, it has opened up the possibility for enterprises to reassess how they participate in that funnel. The potential for global enterprises to own the university experience is, suddenly, very real.
Imagine leveraging these existing education and training platforms to create hyper-specific curricula for enterprises. A gig economy for professors who have been displaced from shuttered universities could provide the online faculty. They’ll design a curriculum specifically suited to an enterprises needs.
These new enterprise-driven, online university systems will vet people for academic excellence and cultural alignment to determine who they want to educate and, ultimately, hire. And all of it will feed them directly into their own systems. These would be university systems not unlike what we see today with, say, The U.S. Naval Academy, where a tuition-free education comes with an obligation to serve for a period of time. Others have speculated that a kind of hybrid, for-profit model that blends universities and global enterprises may also emerge.
“MIT/Google could offer a two-year degree in STEM,” suggested Galloway. “MIT/Google could enroll 100,000 kids at $100,000 in tuition (a bargain), yielding $5 billion a year (two-year program) that would have margins rivaling… MIT and Google. Bocconi/Apple, Carnegie Mellon/Amazon, UCLA/Netflix, Berkeley/Microsoft… you get the idea.”
Higher education is not the only system poised for fundamental  transformation. The U.S. staffing and recruiting market, whose total size was already predicted to decrease 21% due to the coronavirus outbreak, could also see changes in how they operate. No longer will enterprises feel obliged to recruit at universities or utilize the tools, platforms and resources necessary to identify recruits coming out of these outdated systems. Now, theyll have a direct funnel to employees perfectly attuned to their needs. This would be a boon for enterprises that would not only create novel profit centers in their organizations but would also avoid the costly and inefficient process of searching for employees common to most recruiting models today. The savings are not insignificant.
The cost of a bad hire can reach up to 30% of the employee’s first-year earnings, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Undercover Recruiter looked at misadventures in hiring potentially costing enterprise $240,000 in expenses related to hiring, compensation and retention. And one study found that 74% of companies that admit they’ve hired the wrong person lost an average of $14,900 for each bad hire, according to CareerBuilder.
Then there are the ancillary benefits for students the cost of higher education has been skyrocketing for decades, and student debt has reached unacceptable levels, with diminished earning power associated with degrees. A tipping point is fast approaching: One study demonstrated that a college degree decreases in value as the number of graduates increases. So, in Sub-Saharan Africa (where degrees are relatively rare) a degree will boost earnings by more than 20%. In Scandinavia (where 40% of adults have degrees) that number drops to 9%.
These new, enterprise-specific universities would provide real, tangible ROI on every education investment dollar made. The promise of specific jobs upon graduation with good salaries is doubly important in a shaky economy. As universities continue to price themselves out, theyll have a tougher time justifying their costs, particularly when juxtaposed against an online educational system that feeds directly into Google, Twitter or Microsoft. It would likely prove irresistible for many students.
The secondary effects of COVID-19 as it relates to higher education are still not clear, but a possible picture is beginning to emerge. Recruiting could have to transform who they target and how (and when) they go about it. A burgeoning industry that has been supporting a steadily increasing appetite from enterprises for digital education and training could be transformed overnight and grow by leaps and bounds. Students could see debt cut in half and have a clear path forward toward employment. Whatever the ultimate landscape is that emerges, the changes in store for universities and colleges will undoubtedly be unpleasant.
“I think weve stuck out the mother of all chins and the fist of COVID-19 is coming for us,” Galloway told CNN. “Think of another industry that charges 100K and gets 90-plus points of margin. Other than a pharmaceutical for a drug that cures a rare cancer, maybe, what other product gets that kind of margin? Quite frankly, weve had this coming.”
That some kind of change is coming seems clear, but whether or not a paradigm shift in education is a good thing is less so. Like most industries disrupted by software and technology, tremendous value will flow to millions of consumers as technologies drive market efficiencies. There will be jobs that vanish or are transformed and there will be new jobs that are created to satisfy the new way of doing things. Major global enterprise and tech companies stand to profit the most from this transformation, with more wealth and power flowing into the hands of the FAANGs of the corporate world.
There will also be a reshaping of priorities in higher education as intellectual discovery, cultural appreciation and individual growth — the hallmarks of a campus-based liberal arts education — are replaced by the pursuit of a narrowly defined set of vocational skills and corporate efficiencies. The implications of global enterprises wading into higher ed will change not only how we educate, hire and train people but how we fundamentally think about and value higher education, as well."

The plug-and-play retro console, originally set to launch with dozens of games on March 19, has been pushed back because ""the manufacturing and shipping facilities in China have encountered an unavoidable suspension due to the current coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak We deeply apologize for the significant inconvenience, and we humbly ask your understanding and patience while we keep our close attention on the situation.""

The delay follows warnings from other gaming hardware manufacturers that availability of existing products might be impacted by the virus's spread. Nintendo said last month that it expected shortages of Switch hardware and peripherals in the Japanese market due to disruptions to the Chinese supply chain. (This despite the company moving some of its hardware production to Vietnam last year.) And Facebook-owned Oculus said to expect further shortages of the Quest VR headset as the company sees ""additional impact to [its] hardware production due to the coronavirus.""
But the TurboGrafx-16 Mini is the first major piece of gaming hardware to see its initial release delayed by the virus's impact. And the move highlights fears in some corners of the industry that Microsoft and Sony might be forced to delay their planned console launches later this year.
""The videogame sector is currently manufacturing, or beginning to, a once-in-several-years' product generation change for the 2020 holiday season,"" Jefferies Group said in an analyst note published last month (as reported by Business Insider). ""If [company] shutdowns exceed a month or so, game schedules will be delayed. New consoles may likewise suffer supply issues from a prolonged disruption, ahead of their fall 2020 planned launches.""

Other industry watchers have pointed to apparent problems in Apple's Chinese supply chain as evidence that console makers will have trouble producing enough new units for a major launch later this year. But Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter says such worries are premature, to say the least.
Apple ""doesnt really have a realistic manufacturing alternative because of the complexity of assembly (many components, very high specs, relatively high cost),"" Pachter told TechRadar last month. ""In contrast, Xbox and PlayStation dont have to be produced in China, but obviously that is the lowest-cost country.""
For Microsoft's and Sony's console launches to face serious trouble, the impact of the coronavirus on production facilities would have to last through June, Pachter said. Even then, the console makers would likely have ample time to ""quietly arrange for production in Taiwan and Vietnam (at a cost of maybe $510 per unit more, at most) just to be safe,"" he said.
Microsoft announced last month that it was lowering its expected earnings guidance for the third fiscal quarter (ending March 31) because of negative impacts to the production of Surface and Windows OEM hardware. But the company said it expects the performance of other parts of its business, including the Xbox segment, to remain unchanged.

On Thursday afternoon/evening, I developed a nasty cough, replete with heavy chest congestion. This continued into Friday, which is when my fever returned (101.6).
I called my internist on Friday, 3/13. The physicians assistant I spoke with said it sounded like a flu that turned into bronchitis. She prescribed cough syrup and a Z-Pak and said I could feel better as early as the next day.
Unfortunately, I got worse over the weekend, my coughing having progressed to the point where it was making it hard for me to breathe. On Sunday, 3/15, I made my way to the emergency room at NYU Langone Medical Center, my nearest ER. I described my symptoms at the ER, but based on all the horror stories I had read about the difficulty of getting a Covid-19 test, I wasnt expecting muchand I was right.
This was during the worst days of the test shortage. To get tested back then, you needed symptoms AND (1) travel to an affected area, (2) exposure to an affected person, or (3) test results (like cold/flu panel) to rule out alternatives. During that first visit to the ER, they did give me the cold/flu panel, which tests for a wide range of viral and bacterial agents that can cause cold/flu symptoms. My test came up... negative.
By Monday 3/16, I couldnt breathe again. I rushed back to the ERand this time they were on their game. They admitted me, gave me oxygen, put me in an isolation roomand FINALLY gave me the Coronavirus test.
Last weekend, two nights after his Twitter thread, David Lat was intubated and put on a ventilator. He has not tweeted since. He remains in critical condition.
Instead of hearing from patients, the picture were beginning to have is emerging in harrowing terms from the social media posts and interviews with doctors, nurses, EMTs, and health care professionals who are on the front lines of the hospitals responses across America.
Mary Macdonald,emergency department nurse, Oakland County, Michigan, in an Instagram post: Im an emergency room nurse and have been working on the front lines of this coronavirus for the last 10 plus days, and I have to admit that if you had asked me 10-plus days ago if I thought that this was going to get as bad as it was, I wouldve told you no. You heard the rumors, you saw the trends, but until you see it firsthand you just have no idea what its like, what its going to be like, and its truly frightening.
Craig Spencer,Director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, via Twitter: Walk in for your 8 am shift: Immediately struck by how the calm of the early morning city streets is immediately transformed. The bright fluorescent lights of the ER reflect off everyones protective goggles. There is a cacophony of coughing. You stop. Mask up. Walk in.
Meredith Case, internal medicine resident, Columbia University Medical Center, via Twitter: The deluge is here. Our ICU is completely full with intubated Covid patients. We are rapidly moving to expand capacity. We are nearly out of PPE.
Craig Spencer: You take signout from the previous team, but nearly every patient is the same, young and old: Cough, shortness of breath, fever. They are really worried about one patient. Very short of breath, on the maximum amount of oxygen we can give, but still breathing fast.

Sure, Facebook is still ignoring whats shared in private groups and has co-hosted a town hall with Fox News; sure, Googles efforts to ban Covid-19 advertising will play right into Donald Trumps hands. The response isnt perfect. Still, these companies deserve credit for intervening so decisively.
The flipside of that applause is, well, why wouldnt they intervene decisively? There are no good arguments for platforming information that will get people killed. Beyond that, false claims about the virus are often cut-and-dry, and therefore more amenable to fact-checks. Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees, telling the New York Times that falsehoods about the virus cross a clear threshold, making it easier to set policies that are a little more black and white and take a much harder line. These policiesincluding Facebooks efforts to surface accurate information, remove harmful information, and ban exploitative Covid-19 adsdont represent some sudden about-face on moderating content. Instead, they reflect the uniqueness of the moment. Zuckerbergs responses suggest that medical and political misinformation are simply different: they have different standards and features and consequences. So dont worry, he implies, once our current information lockdown order lifts, such policies can slip back into their much less clear-cut, hands-off normal.
God help us if they do. The pre-pandemic normal is part of the reason were in this mess. By not taking seriously the ways in which political misinformation is itself a threat to public health, well fail to learn what must be learned from this pandemic.
From the outset of the Wuhan outbreak in January, coronavirus conspiracy theories roared across social media. On the reactionary fringes, these centered on QAnon and the usual Deep State suspects, narratives that have been percolating in far-right corners for years. Within the more mainstream rightto the extent that such a thing exists in 2020commentators may have sidestepped QAnon but theyve still pinned the tail on the Deep State. For example, Sean Hannity said earlier this month that it may be true that a nefarious army of resistance bureaucrats were using the outbreak to manipulate economies, suppress dissent, and push mandated medicines. Many others, including Donald Trump, insisted that the response to Covid-19 was a feverish overreaction of the fake news media and their Democratic allies, who were desperate to tank the economy in order to hurt Trumps reelection. It was just another impeachment hoax.
And so millions of people in the US downplayed the threat, blamed the Democrats, and derided scientific expertise. The specific circumstances of the Covid-19 outbreak may have been new, but the underlying arguments were not. Donald Trump won the 2016 election on a wave of screw-the-Left, drain-the-swamp, ignore-the-lamestream-media energies. Given that buildup of pollution, and all the time it had to filter through the far-right water table, its no surprise that the Covid-19 threat was metat least in the critical first few months, when we could have started preparing en massewith partisan jeers, attacks on the media, and efforts to own the libs through social un-distancing. It certainly wasnt a surprise that someone like Anthony Fauci would be roped into his very own Deep State plot.
Were only just now beginning to feel the consequences. Our healthcare system, already strained, is struggling to keep pace with surging cases. Sirens wail day and night through New York City.
The population didnt know what it needed to know, wasnt doing what it needed to do, and seemed on the verge of indescribable loss if something didnt change. Thats precisely why Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and the like were forced to take such drastic measures to curb the spread of false information. But the platforms only acted after having wasted months dithering in principled restrainttreating Covid-19 conspiracy theories and racist invective and false cures as if they were all no different from normal political speech, and thus deserving of the same broad protections. At least by 2020 standards, this was normal political speech. But from the very outset, it was also a threat to public health. The platforms only made that connectionand their public relations caseafter the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Of course some falsehood has slipped through the cracks since then; even after the WHO designation, QAnon supporters on Facebook have kept themselves plenty busy, and so have antivaxxers. Whats different now is the posture of social responsibility affected by those in charge. In the past, Zuckerberg has stated that he doesnt think Facebook should remove deeply offensive, deeply false things like Holocaust denial. People should be allowed to be wrong, he said; its not Facebooks job to intervene when they are. Now, the argument is that Facebook should take false Covid-19 information down. That it is the platforms job to intervene.
But these are extraordinary times. Writing in Foreign Affairs last week, political communication scholars Sarah Krep and Brendan Nyhan argued that the spread of false political information doesnt and shouldnt warrant the same kinds of sweeping, break-glass-in-case-of-emergency measures as the spread of false medical information, because political information does not threaten peoples health."

As in other countries, the app is meant to complement conventional contract tracing efforts wherein medical professionals reach out to people who may have come in contact with a COVID-19 patient. The software uses Bluetooth LE to record when the user passes someone else who has the app installed on their phone. It also notes how long they've been near one another. Should a user of the app test positive for COVID-19, it will inform anyone they've been in contact with for longer than 15 minutes. Governments worldwide see smartphone contract tracing apps as an essential tool in stopping a potential second wave of COVID-19 cases, but they need widespread adoption to be useful. 
Besides low adoption, other issues may hamper the effectiveness of the app. Not all of Germany's clinics can transmit test results electronically. In those instances, people who test positive for COVID-19 will need to phone a national hotline to sync their apps properly. There's a worry some people may call the hotline to troll people who have the app installed on their phone. At launch, the software also isn't compatible with the contract tracing apps other European governments have deployed in their countries; roaming functionality is something Germany plans to add some time in the next few weeks. 
Still, a lot is riding on the success of the app. According to tracking by Johns Hopkins University, the country has had 188,213 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,814 deaths to date, meaning it has had both fewer cases and deaths than Italy and the UK. But with the government easing travel restrictions and events like IFA coming up, there's a chance for the coronavirus to flare up again."

The United States needed to reopen the economy. To a non-expert, the argument sounded compelling. The author, Silicon Valley growth hacker Aaron Ginn, used Johns Hopkins data to make his point. On Medium, the piece blended in with fact-checked articles from doctors and epidemiologists, until it was debunked in an eviscerating tweet thread by an actual infectious disease expert, Carl T. Bergstrom, a biology professor at the University of Washington. Shortly after, it was taken down. In many ways, this was Medium working as intended. The company operates both as a blogging platform and as a media outlet. Some articles, written by professional journalists who work at one of Medium’s publications, are fact-checked. Others are written by conspiracy theorists and contain dangerous misinformation. After all, the company’s mission, according to CEO Ev Williams, is to level the playing field and encourage “ideas that come from anywhere.” As the pandemic disrupts life in the US, Medium has made strides to stop the spread of misleading health news. Its own publications, like OneZero and Elemental, have covered COVID-19 with the journalistic ethics, editing, and fact-checking you’d expect from a traditional outlet. Medium also started an official COVID-19 blog to promote articles from verified experts. It rolled out a coronavirus content policy and hired a team of science editors. But the decision to curate some content — to hire professional journalists and promote verified articles — has made it harder to tell fact from fiction on the platform. While user-generated pieces now have a warning at the top telling users the content isn’t fact-checked, they look otherwise identical to those written by medical experts or reporters. In some ways, this is the promise of Medium: to make the work of amateurs look professional. Reading a 2,000-word article that contains misinformation about COVID-19 also seems notably different than reading a few of the same ideas in a tweet. It might not have mattered when Medium was a home for productivity hacks. But coronavirus misinformation could put people’s lives at risk. The situation has forced Medium to wade deeper into the waters of content moderation, where big tech firms have been floundering for years. Now, the platform that was built as a home for the world’s “unique perspectives” is in the position of deciding which perspectives actually matter. One of the most prominent voices on Medium about COVID-19 belongs to Tomás Pueyo, another Silicon Valley growth hacker. Pueyo wrote “Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,” which has over 40 million views, making it one of the most widely read articles about the virus. This is the best-case scenario for Medium. Pueyo is a credible non-expert who has a lot to say but no clear place to say it. Also, he can make sense of data. He learned how to read complex academic papers while building social apps in Silicon Valley. When the virus started to spread in the US, he immersed himself in Johns Hopkins’ repository on GitHub to figure out what was going on. Pueyo’s insight, which now seems obvious, was that novel coronavirus cases were growing exponentially. It was a pattern he recognized from when one of his apps had gone viral, adding 7 million users in three months. This comparison — viral apps to viral disease — would normally sound too convenient. This time, it actually worked. Pueyo argued on Medium that the coronavirus problem was worse and more immediate than most people knew or expected. Overnight, his article exploded. Andrew Yang shared it, as did the psychologist Steven Pinker. It was quoted in The New York Times. BuzzFeed called it the “defining piece on the outbreak of COVID-19.” The attention brought with it criticism, mostly focused on Pueyo’s background. He doesn’t have experience in epidemiology, and, to date, he has mostly built apps. One of these, Zoo World, helps people build virtual zoos. Asked about this feedback, however, Pueyo seems delighted. “It’s great!” he says. “You need the checks and balances, especially in my case, because I’m nobody. I have no training in epidemiology.” When A.J. Kay, an essayist in Tempe, Arizona, began learning about COVID-19 cases in the US, she didn’t think the information added up. It seemed off that the disease was being called “highly transmissible,” but only one person in Arizona person had it. (Testing for COVID-19 has notoriously lagged in the US, meaning that many people who may be sick with the disease aren’t counted in the official numbers.) Kay isn’t an epidemiologist. Until last month, her most popular article on Medium was about having her breast implants removed. But she grew more suspicious when her ex-husband lost his job at a local hospital. If there was such a shortage of health care workers, why on earth was one being fired? Also, her child support payments were now at risk. Kay compared the number of known COVID-19 cases with flu data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and came to a surprising conclusion: the virus had come to the United States far earlier than was previously reported. What people were predicting would be the peak — the menacing time when COVID-19 cases would overwhelm hospitals in cities across the US — was likely already happening. If she was right, the draconian measures state governments were enacting, like shutting down nonessential businesses, seemed woefully out of proportion with the problem. In the article, Kay admitted the situation was personal. Last year, she’d discovered she had a tumor in her liver but was told it was too low-risk to remove. Recently, she’d begun developing symptoms that seemed to indicate the disease was spreading. She needed to get a scan but couldn’t because the procedure was considered elective. If Kay could convince people that the virus wasn’t as bad as they thought, she might be able to finally address the problem. She also knew that her entire family had been extremely ill in early January. The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona was reported at the end of January. “I started putting things together in my head and I was like wait a minute…” she says. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth.” Her article, “The Curve Is Already Flat,” got 275,000 views in the first 48 hours it was published. Like Ginn’s piece, it fed into the conservative narrative that the mainstream media had gotten this wrong. Kay says she didn’t intend to take a political stand, but she was happy to see the article go viral. Two days after publishing, Kay received an email from Medium. “Due to elevated risk of potential harm to persons or public health, Medium’s Trust and Safety team has removed the following content,” it said. Medium had concluded that her article contained “health claims or advice which, if acted on, are likely to have detrimental health effects on persons or public safety.” A screenshot of the email Medium sent to A.J. Kay. Kay had watched a similar situation play out with Ginn. She’d liked his article, calling it the “first coronavirus piece that made sense” and was surprised when Medium took it down. Now, she felt like she was also being censored for refusing to play into the popular narrative. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth,” she says. Kay’s piece was quickly republished on a conservative blog, after receiving support from libertarian thinkers who derided Medium for censorship. An editor’s note at the top now reads: “This piece originally appeared on Medium.com and was removed without explanation or warning.” (Ginn’s piece was republished on a different conservative blog.) Medium’s communications team wouldn’t say how, exactly, the company decides to take an article down. They also declined to comment on how they discover misinformation on the platform and wouldn’t say how many people are tasked with finding and regulating content. When asked why, specifically, Kay’s piece was taken down, a company spokesperson sent over the COVID-19 content policy, declining to comment on specifics. Medium did say that it takes into account the newsworthiness of the piece as well as the “context and nature of the posted information, the likelihood and severity of actual or potential harms, and applicable laws” when deciding whether to take action. When asked about Ginn’s piece, Sandee Roston, the company’s head of communications, sent the following statement: We’re giving careful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content on Medium to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety. The Ginn post was removed based on its violation of our Rules, specifically the risk analysis framework we use for ‘ Controversial, Suspect and Extreme content.’ We’ve clarified these rules with our Covid-19 Content Policy to address more specific concerns around the evolving public health crisis, and we are actively taking down Covid-19 stories that violate this, such as the Kay piece. Part of the problem Medium is facing is that the situation is changing so fast. Information that seems true one day can quickly look wrong or out of date by the next. In February, the surgeon general told everyone to stop buying masks. Now, the CDC is urging everyone to wear cloth masks all the time. Journalism, by its nature, is rarely predictive. It tells people what’s true at the moment, often with a bit of analysis. “What seems to be true today may be wrong tomorrow,” wrote Charlie Warzel in The New York Times. BuzzFeed’s late-January article urging people to worry about the flu rather than the novel coronavirus looks laughable today — as does Vox ’s January 31st tweet saying the situation would not become a deadly pandemic. At the time, however, these ideas were the prevailing wisdom. In this period of uncertainty, Medium is giving people a place to speculate and offer concrete solutions — even if those solutions are unverified. For the writers, the stakes are low. If they’re wrong, most of the time, no one will notice. If they’re right, as Pueyo was, they could suddenly become an “expert” overnight. From that lens, Medium’s mission seems like a relic from another era, one where people believed giving everyone a voice on the internet would make the world a better place. Williams admitted as such when he spoke to The New York Times in 2017 about why he thought the internet was broken. “I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,” he said. “I was wrong about that.” It’s unclear how Medium solves that, and its opaque policies surrounding COVID-19 allow the company to enable the spread of misinformation while absolving itself of responsibility. Even Pueyo is self-aware of the platform’s dangers. When asked about people criticizing his article, he was okay with it: “I have no training in epidemiology,” he said. “You should definitely not trust me.”"

No one has it easy during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Amazon has it particularly hard. Google, Facebook, and Netflix all deliver their services over the internet, and a healthy amount of that work can be done from home. Amazon, by contrast, has taken on the job of delivering physical goods to our homes. At a time when tens of millions of Americans are isolated in their homes, Amazon has become a critical lifeline delivering food and supplies. But over the past several days, Amazon has begun to struggle under the weight.
The most significant news so far came Sunday night, when Jason Del Rey broke the news that Amazons famous two-day shipping for Prime members would now be delayed up to a month for non-essential items. Del Rey writes:
An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Recode on Sunday evening that the new April 21 delivery dates are not the result of a technical bug or error; they accurately reflect Amazons current reality.
To serve our customers in need while also helping to ensure the safety of our associates, weve changed our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes to prioritize stocking and delivering items that are a higher priority for our customers, the spokesperson said in a statement. This has resulted in some of our delivery promises being longer than usual.
At least Americans can still get non-essential items. (Which is to say, items outside the following departments: baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; groceries; and industrial, scientific, and pet supplies.) Thats not true in France or Italy any more, Krystal Hu reported at Reuters. The company has temporarily stopped taking orders for non-essential items that are shipped through its fulfillment service while it focuses on getting more important items to customers.
The company also suspended Prime Pantry, a service for getting rapid delivery of discounted grocery and household items, amid a surge in demand. And at the request of local governments it downgraded the quality of streaming on Prime Video in Europe in an effort to reduce the strain on the internet.
To be clear, Amazon has nothing to be ashamed of here. The company is navigating an extremely difficult period fraught with unpleasant trade-offs, and for the most part its supply chain has held up. The crisis has also spurred the company to (finally) recognize the everyday heroism of the workers in its distribution and delivery networks, who continue to put themselves at risk to keep America stocked up with necessities. As of Saturday, the company increased wages by $2 an hour and is offering double pay to workers who spend more than 40 hours on the job each week. And on Monday, the company finally agreed to provide paid time off for tens of thousands of warehouse employees.
Amazon has also said it will hire 100,000 new workers to help with increased demand amid the crisis, offering an equally important lifeline to a nation staring down the barrel of double-digit unemployment for the first time in recent memory.
In a memo to employees made public on Saturday, CEO Jeff Bezos said he is fully committed to addressing the COVID-19 challenge:
My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role. I want you to know Amazon will continue to do its part, and we wont stop looking for new opportunities to help.
One thing that could be helpful in this time is for Amazon to regularly brief the public on the health of its distribution networks and its expectations for any service interruptions in the immediate future. The company has historically worked to keep the media at greater than arms length, communicating primarily by press release. 
But the current crisis is changing the companys service so frequently, and with such high stakes, that a different approach is needed. One model Amazon might consider is that of Facebook, which over the past couple years began hosting regular briefings on subjects in the news. (There have been a lot about Russia, misinformation, and election security, for example.) Last week, the company held a briefing on its coronavirus response, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg took questions from the press.
If it undertook similar measures, Amazon could build confidence in its services. The alternative a torturous drip of news about service disruptions, delivered at odds hours across various news outlets who manage to get a response back from the companys public relations team has made for a grim status quo. It is not an approach that bears the hallmarks of customer obsession.
If you pay for Amazon Web Services, the company sells you guaranteed uptime if the service fails more than 0.01 percent of the time, you get a discount on future service. Already, some are speculating that Amazon will offer similar discounts to those affected by the understandable disruptions caused by COVID-19.
But theres something else the company could do, and it has the virtue of being basically free. It could regularly tell all its customers whats happening today, and what to expect tomorrow. If Bezos is right that things are going to get worse before they get better, as he told his employees, then his customers could use as much time as possible to begin contemplating their alternatives.

Despite a series of decisive victories in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona, Joe Bidens presidential campaign is struggling to move forward. Campaigning online and staying relevant during the coronavirus pandemic are two major hurdles. Heres Marc Caputo at Politico:
Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also cant meet with donors at fundraisers which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy thats sinking into recession or perhaps worse.
Its a tough position, said Matt Littman, whos hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software.
Its harder to raise money when theres no face-to-face meeting and personal contact, Littman said. And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I cant count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.

Industry
Instagram has prototyped an unreleased ephemeral messaging feature that clears the chat thread whenever you leave it. It looks a lot like Snapchats most popular feature. Josh Constine at TechCrunch has the scoop:
Instagram Stories caused Snapchat to start shrinking at one point, but now its growing healthily again. That may signaled that Instagram still had more work to do to steal Snaps thunder. But Instagrams existing version of ephemeral messaging that is clunkier, Facebook scrapped a trial of a similar feature, and WhatsApps take that started testing in October hasnt rolled out yet.
Thats left teens to stick with Snapchat for fast-paced communication they dont have to worry about coming back to haunt them. If Instagram successfully copies this feature too, it could reduce the need for people to stay on Snapchat while making Instagram Direct more appealing to a critical audience. Every reply and subsequent alert draws users deeper into Facebooks web.

Photo by John Nacion/NurPhoto via Getty Images
In a normal year, fourth-year medical students across the United States would have some downtime in April. They would have already found out where theyll be doing their residencies and should have the whole month or more to coast through to graduation and the start of their medical careers in the summer. 
But this isnt a normal year, and a handful of medical schools around the country are offering to let students graduate early so they can join the fight against COVID-19. The Grossman School of Medicine at New York University was the first to do so. Eligible students whod already met graduation requirements could become doctors a few months ahead of schedule if they agreed to join the emergency or internal medicine departments at NYUs hospital. 
Gaby Mayer is one of the dozens of NYU students who volunteered to graduate early. (Full disclosure: shes also my friend.) Shed first heard that early graduation might be an option a few weeks ago when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo mentioned the possibility at a press conference. We werent sure if it would really get there, but we knew that other countries that were getting hit hard by COVID-19 were entertaining similar plans, she says. 
Now that its official, she says shes relieved that she can help. 
This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
How did you feel when you were officially asked to graduate early?
Wed all been talking about it informally as medical students. We really felt like a lot of us were sitting around doing a lot of nothing between now and graduation. We were feeling really happy to have a skill set where we could go into the hospital and relieve some of the strain. The first response was relief and, in some ways, excitement.
I think Id be remiss to not say I was a little nervous. The prospect of becoming a doctor for the first time is always going to be overwhelming, and theres a big learning curve at the beginning. To be learning in this hectic environment is certainly an additional challenge, but I think were ready for it. 
What are you doing to prepare for COVID-19, specifically? 
Ive been keeping up with case reports and keeping an eye on the medical literature. Now, Ill dive in a bit more. Since the announcement, a lot of us have put together a plan for the next few weeks less about COVID-19, but more about how well be transitioning our role in the hospital. 
What will your role be in the hospital during the outbreak?
Im not sure how much of what Ill be doing will be different from what I would have been doing in my first year. But normally, wed be there to keep parts of patient care moving forward so they receive appropriate care. Were the first ones to see patients in the morning, we coordinate consults between the different areas of medicine, write notes on patients, and keep the closest eye on them. We do that so the senior medical staff, whos closely supervising us, can both teach us about things like diagnoses but also so they can have room to think about the higher-level plan. 
The dean mentioned that we wouldnt be seeing intubated or medically complex patients, so my guess is that theyll try to keep us out of COVID-19 areas. But its hard to say for sure. 
How does it feel to enter medicine and become a doctor right now?
I feel really prepared. I wouldnt have volunteered if I felt in any way that I wouldnt be able to serve my patients. I think Im going to have to adjust my expectations, but there wont be a lot of adjusting of the core things I need to be a good doctor. 
I think I am a little nervous, of course. A big part of [the first year of residency] is about having a strong team to walk you through this new identity and new role. I think Im a little bit nervous about whether well get the same attention. Well get the same supervision in terms of patient care, but this is all happening in a crazy environment. 
But the biggest feeling I have is one of gratitude that I can help. Im really committed to patient care. Its the reason I went to medical school, and it keeps me really grounded. To be able to come back to that is a gift in a time when things are so crazy.

Hold, also, to this: When humanity hits a crisis, it always looks to science for help. Not because scientists are perfect, or even smarter on average than other humans, but because science is one of the best ways humans have come up with to reliably understand how the world works and how to fix it when it's broken.
The really important thing about science, though, is that it lets people understand the world together. Scientists don't just discover things. They write about them in agreed-upon formats, construct experiments and collect data in convincingly logical ways, and use a vast distribution network to share what they know. Science is a force for civilization.
You're scared right now because it seems like that civilization might be falling apart. The leading scientists in the United States seem sidelined. It feels like people who clearly don't understand something aren't listening to people who do. Consensus, that feeling of togetherness, shatters. You think you might be alonenot just that you might get sick but that no one is coming to help you.
But they are. They will. If we hold the line.
Society is about to change, and no one can be sure how. But your fear is also the result of a playbook. Good scientists give an honest accounting of their own uncertainties, but when scientists point out that powerful people are doing dangerous things, those people dilute the critique by emphasizing the uncertainties. It's a hell of a good juke, and it has been going on for so longpretending cigarettes don't cause cancer or that burning petrochemicals doesn't destroy the planetthat it can seem as if scientists can't ever really know anything, that we have no real basis for a shared understanding of the world or for any responsibilities to each other.
Intensive care units are overflowing. A brand-new disease is killing people we love. But we have to remember that inside that storm, faithin each other and in the scientists and medical workers who are dedicating their minds, all over the planet, to the work of understanding and fighting this virusis the antidote to fear. Their work needs time, which means we all have to work, together, to slow the virus's spread.
Covid-19 wasn't the first killer disease of the 21st century. It isn't even the first coronavirusin 2003 and 2004, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, killed 774 people around the world. Since 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, has killed 858 people. The numbers seem small now, but they were a signal that a respiratory virus could run the planetary table. Some countries prepared; the United States didn't.
Now we're all looking to the scientists again. They're on it.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
This disease showed up in December 2019. By January 10, the new virus's genetic sequence was online. Labs around the world soon learned to test people to see if they were infected (a ball quickly dropped by a hobbled American public health system). Now scientists have found dozens of existing drugs that are promising. The first human trials of a vaccine have started. Immunologists have found antibodies that work against the virus and are hoping to test synthetic versions in people by summer. More data will help epidemiologists learn how to let people who've been sheltering in place go back to work, to rescue the economy. (That's going to require a lot of testing to see who's sick and who has recovered.)"

But the ingredients for that exact scenario will be baked into Google and Apple's operating system in as soon as a matter of days. Now the two companies have shown not only how it will work, but how it could lookand how it'll let you know if you're at risk.
On Monday, Apple and Google released a few new details about the Bluetooth system they're building into both Android and iOS that will let health care authorities track potential encounters with Covid-19. The companies have now made clear that only government agenciespreferably at the national level, Google and Apple say, though they note they're willing to work with state and regional authoritieswill be granted permission to the feature's application programming interface. If those government-run apps want access to Apple and Google's Bluetooth-based system, they won't be allowed to collect location data, and must ask for consent before collecting information on a user's proximity to others. They'll need permission to upload any information from the phones of Covid-19 positive people as well. again before uploading any information from the phones of Covid-19 positive people.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
The two companies have published sample user interface screenshots for the first time as well. As Google and Apple first outlined last month, their Covid-19 exposure notification system transmits unique, rotating codes from phones via their Bluetooth radios based on cryptographic keys that change daily. They not only keep a log of the last two weeks of your codes, but also listen for the codes broadcast by others. If two people running the app spend a certain amount of time in proximitysay, 10 minutes within six feet, or whatever health care agencies dictatetheir phones will both record each others' Bluetooth codes. If one of them later receives a positive Covid-19 diagnosis, they can choose to upload all of their keys from the last two weeks to the app's server, which will then send those keys out to the phones of all the other users in their region. Those phones will then check if the codes they've recorded from other nearby users can be generated from those keys. If you get a match, the app will show a message that you've potentially been exposed to Covid-19 and caution you to self-quarantine or get tested.
Now Google and Apple are showing how some parts of that process might look. The two companies warn, however, that they're only releasing sample images as references, since health care agencies will build the final apps, not Apple and Google.
Here, for instance, is how Google and Apple suggest the apps ask for user consent to transmit and record Bluetooth codes when the app is first installed:

First came the flawed swab-based tests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, followed by a chaotic, lost month of regulatory tango that prevented independent tests from getting scaled and out the door. So when interest arose in a different kind of testingantibody blood tests, which are used to find evidence of past infection, not a current diagnosisthe US Food and Drug Administration was under pressure to hurry things along. In mid-March, the agency loosened its rules, declaring via an update to its emergency use guidance that antibody tests could be sold without seeking the agencys approval, provided that manufacturers did their own validation.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
Now FDA officials are walking back that decision. Facing criticism that the loosened policy has undammed a flood of flawed tests and fraudulent marketing, agency officials revised their rules Monday to require manufacturers to submit their tests for validation and meet specific standards for accuracy.
Flexibility never meant we would allow fraud, wrote Anand Shah, an FDA deputy commissioner, and Jeff Shuren, director of the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a blog post elaborating on the changes. They called out unscrupulous actors who were using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans anxiety.
So far, the FDA has approved 12 antibody tests through the emergency use processincluding those from large manufacturers such as Roche, Ortho, and Abbottand most of them only in the last few days. Yet agency officials say that more than 160 others are being sold in the US without the FDAs authorization. They note that some companies have used the agencys tacit allowance of the tests to market their tests as FDA approved, in explicit violation of the earlier guidance.
But fraud isnt the only issue. One of the key performance problems with antibody tests has been false positives, or when a test erroneously signals that its found evidence of a past infection. Due to low rates of Covid-19 antibody prevalence in the US population (most estimates put the figure in the low single digits) even a test with a very low false positive rate can produce just as many false positives as true ones. Someone who has received a false positive might assume they are now immune to the disease. And thats a dicey proposition when antibody tests are being eyed for assisting in important decisions, like who is qualified to donate convalescent plasma that could help treat Covid-19 patients, and who is fit to go back to the office or make rounds on a hospital floor.
False negatives can also be a problemthats when someone who is actually carrying the virus tests negative, potentially because they are in the early stages of the disease and their viral load is low enough that it falls beneath the threshold the test can detect. In that case, the person risks infecting others because they think they are not contagious.
Concerned scientists had already stepped in to do their own validation. Flawed tests have found their way to county health departments and hospitals, where they were intended to test frontline medical workers, only to be ditched because the results couldnt be trusted. The problem extends beyond the United States.

But during a pandemic, robots can help patients fight off feelings of isolation and despair.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-robot-companions/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5eebec3f9c7b73c795c4a8f9/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Culture_paroseal_h_6.07051502.jpg",2020-06-22T12:00:00Z,"During the Covid-19 crisis, Shibata has corresponded with people all over the world who have recently turned to Paro robots as a therapeutic tool. In addition to their increased prominence in elderly and memory care, Shibata says the pandemic has created some novel use cases. Workers at a high-volume call center in Tokyo who dealt with calls about coronavirus testing were given a Paro as a stress-relief tool this May. And Shibata has been emailing with a 34-year-old nurse in an Atlanta intensive care unit who started using a Paro this April as a way to cope with being isolated from his loved ones and pet. He used to live with his family and a dog at the home, but in order to avoid any risks of infection from him to them, they moved to a different house, Shibata says. Until he can return home, the Paro provides a semblance of companionship.
This sense of companionship doesnt come cheap, though. Paro is predominantly used by institutions, because its price tagaround $6,000 in the United Statesmakes it prohibitively expensive for many individuals. It's a very real access problem, Carpenter says.
Paro, however, isnt the only companion robot geared at alleviating loneliness. Sonys Aiboa cheerful dog equipped with a camera specifically to monitor children and the elderlyis less expensive than Paro but still costs around $2,800. There are more affordable models, like Joy for Alls stuffed animal-esque robots, which are available at places like Best Buy for around $130, although these offerings are more toylike than medical-grade. Jibo, a $900 social robot, gained devoted fans after its introduction in 2014 and looked like it could become a mainstream companion robot. But Jibo sunsetted its social robot in 2019, leaving loyal users sad that their little plastic friend no longer functionedand highlighting the perils of bonding with an AI.
Meanwhile, the ElliQ, a digital companion from Israeli startup Intuition Robotics designed to help the elderly, isnt commercially available yet, but Intuition is offering a free beta program during Covid-19. ElliQ doesnt have the same tactile appeal as a fluffy seal, but its users have still become invested in the machines well-being during the pandemic. As part of the program, several users agreed to be interviewed and monitored by the companys research team, a project thats given the company intimate insights into how people are actually interacting with its creation, including what they say to their devices. The conversations make it apparent that people are using this type of robot as a sounding board, asking it the kind of questions theyd ask any friend. Part of it is what you would expect, like What are the symptoms for Covid? How many people are sick in my area? Things of that nature,"" says Dor Skuler, a cofounder of Intuition Robotics. ""Part of it is really interestingthey're inquiring how she is doing. Were seeing this often, like How do you feel, ElliQ? ElliQ, can you get the virus? ElliQ, are you afraid?
While the arrangement between ElliQs beta testers and the company is voluntary, it underscores how this kind of companion robot does need to be closely examined for how well it safeguards its users information. Since many sophisticated companion robots gather data in order to customize their responses to users, theyre essentially friendly surveillance devices. There are some privacy issues and potentially ethical ones, Carpenter says of companion robots. Especially if a patient is not cognizant of risks because they have dementia. Right now, a lot of these robots are designed so that, for example, data doesn't go to the cloud and lives in the robot, so that's helpful in terms of security. But people still need to ask these questions. Many of these companies, including the makers of Paro and ElliQ, say they have considered these questions seriously and implemented protocols to protect privacy. Paro stores data locally and is not connected to the internet. ElliQ does sometimes store data in a cloud, but Skuler says Intuition has gone to great lengths to secure that information.
For all of the assistance and companionship that robots like Paro and ElliQ offer, though, they do raise a much larger question: Is it possible to make robots like these less necessary in a post-pandemic world? I really hope that if there is any silver lining with Covid, it's that people will see how isolated older adults are in society, Skuler says. Lets not forget about them when were back to work."

Data from the CDC report about symptoms among High Harbour staffers and campers was only available for 136 patients, with most showing mild symptoms including fever, headache, and sore throat. About a quarter of infected people reported no symptoms at all. The study did not say whether anyone had been hospitalized. (For questions about the outbreak, a Georgia Department of Public Health spokesman referred WIRED to the CDC report.)
According to the report, High Harbour followed many of the CDCs recommendations for summer camps, including enhanced cleaning and disinfection procedures, staggering the use of communal spaces, and requiring physical distancing outside of cabins. But other recommendations regarding the use of masks and increasing ventilation whenever possible, were not followed. The report found that camp leaders did not require open windows and doors to increase air circulation, which is necessary to prevent the build-up of virus-containing aerosols. And while staff were required to wear cloth masks, High Harbour did not ask campers to do so. (The YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta officials did not contest these details, saying only in their statement that High Harbour made every effort to follow CDC guidelines and has cooperated with the agency in its investigation.)
The CDC report concluded, in 28 of the camps 31 cabins, at least one person, and often many, tested positive. Relatively large cohorts sleeping in the same cabin and engaging in regular singing and cheering likely contributed to transmission, the CDC report authors wrote. Evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been building for months, making it clearer just how important the roles of masks, physical distancing, and good ventilation are in stemming the diseases spread.
In an emailed statement, officials at the YMCAs national office told WIRED that the organization worked with the American Camp Association, the CDC, and a consortium of infectious disease, medical and sanitation experts to publish health and safety guidelines for all Y camps, to use in determining if and how they could operate. While the majority of YMCA day camps have opened this summer, the vast majority of our overnight camps chose not to open. Of those overnight camps that did open, we are not aware of any other COVID-19 outbreaks, nor are we aware of any camps that chose to close in reaction to the situation at High Harbour, they wrote.
States are required to report any positive cases of Covid-19 to the federal government, a process which has been complicated as of late due to a disastrous data collection turf war between the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services. But theyre not required to keep tabs on summer camp-specific outbreaks. That makes it hard to know if the High Harbour outbreak is an outlier, or a signifier of what awaits efforts to reunite children with IRL classrooms.
Many state public health departments that WIRED contacted did not collect information about outbreaks at summer camps, or would only provide it under a formal records request. One state that did have that data was Vermont, with zero summer camp cases to reportwhich makes that state exceptional in more ways than one. Right now, Jha said, Vermont and Maine look like the parts of the European Union that best prevented community spread of the virus. That means countries like Norway, Denmark and Germany, that were able to reopen schools without runway viral spread. The low case incidence, combined with strong safety measures, should make it pretty safe for these northeastern states to send their kids back to school, Jha said. Over the past week, Vermont has had an average of four cases per day, according to data collected by The New York Times. Maine has had 20. Case rates in both states are trending down. By comparison, in the last week Georgia has recorded an average of 3,372 daily cases, an increase of 13 percent from the average two weeks earlier.

Amy Wesolowski, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says the High Harbour example shows that asking for proof of negative coronavirus tests before large gatherings isnt a sufficient preventative tactic on its own. These tests can miss someone in the early stages of infectionbefore the virus has replicated to detectable levels. People can also get exposed in the time it takes to receive their results, and may attend future gatherings thinking they are in the clear, even though those test results are now outdated."

Those mutations aren’t cause for concern, and so far, don’t appear to be making the virus any more or less dangerous. But scientists can use those slight changes to track the virus from person to person, and location to location. “If we identify a new outbreak cluster in one state, and there’s a question of whether it’s related to a previous cluster or not, the small mutational changes can help you figure out if they’re connected,” says Patrick Boyle, a synthetic biologist at Ginkgo Bioworks. The coronavirus is made up of around 29,000 building blocks of genetic material called nucleotides. Like other biotechnology companies and labs, Ginkgo has the technology to take a sample of the virus and read out the full sequence of those nucleotides. For the most part, the sequence will be the same in each sample. But the virus makes copies of itself within a human host, and sometimes, it can make mistakes — switching one or two nucleotides out for another. The version of the virus with those changes can then be passed on when that person infects someone else. Ginkgo is repurposing its systems, which normally don’t sequence viruses, to analyze as many samples of the coronavirus as possible. The goal is to help build out the maps that show how the virus jumped from one person to the next. They’re hoping to scale up to be able to publish the full genetic sequence of 10,000 virus samples a day. This is awesome. I know groups that currently have samples in need of sequencing. I'll let them know about @Ginkgo 's offer. — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 24, 2020 Despite the skyrocketing numbers of COVID-19 cases in the US, only a limited number of virus samples collected in the country have been sequenced in full. Scientists have more sequences from Washington state than other places. Consequently, they know more about the trajectory of the outbreak in Washington than they know about outbreaks in other states. Some of that genetic data is how Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was able to link a case of COVID-19 diagnosed on February 27 in Washington to a case that was diagnosed in late January in the state — indicating that the virus had been circulating locally, and undetected, for that entire time. It also showed that the January case sparked a cluster of illnesses that spread through the community. Other states are starting to do the same kind of detective work, using genetic sequences to help clarify their outbreaks. An analysis of nine virus samples collected in Connecticut showed that the some were related to viruses found in Washington state, which suggests that the coronavirus was spreading domestically, not being repeatedly brought in from other countries. The analysis has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. Other preliminary research examined virus samples from northern California, and found that the coronavirus was introduced to the area at multiple points. New preprint from the @NathanGrubaugh lab. Here we sequenced 9 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from early cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut. The majority of the genomes clustered with other sequences from the U.S., suggesting spread across the country (thread) https://t.co/jCeyC48ExS pic.twitter.com/WIauOEUenU — Joseph Fauver (@JosephFauver) March 28, 2020 One challenge in expanding the number of virus sequences available, Boyle says, is obtaining patient samples to analyze. Labs in the US and other countries that are running tests for the virus receive hundreds or thousands of patient samples each day. But the focus of those labs is checking a sample to see if the coronavirus is there — and the patient has COVID-19 — or if it isn’t. The emphasis on testing and diagnosing patients is critical to track the pandemic, Boyle says. “The problem is, it only gives you a positive or negative answer,” he says. Tests don’t provide any extra information about the particular virus in each patient. Ginkgo plans to partner with testing labs, so that they can take a closer look at the virus in a patient sample after the testing is done. Other labs and groups worldwide are embarking on similar projects: a research consortium in the United Kingdom, for example, has over $20 million in funding to sequence samples. Boyle says that Gingko is coordinating with some other labs interested in this work. They’re also making sure that they can access the chemicals and other supplies they need to run the genetic analysis, Boyle says. “We want to make sure that our supply stream is not competing with the supply stream that keeps the testing running.” Expanding the number of coronavirus sequences available will give scientists a picture of the outbreak, in the US and around the world. Along with testing, it’s one way scientists can keep track of the virus’s movements — and help to rein it in."

This story is part of a group of stories called 
The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here.
Most days in this column I try to bring you one big story about the intersection of tech and democracy, but reading the news today I find I cant draw any real lessons for you. Instead I see a few clusters of stories that feel worth reading and thinking about. Lets take a look.
The big story of the week continues to be the (tentative, premature) plans to begin re-opening society as states manage to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections. Ive already linked Ed Yongs masterful piece in The Atlantic here once this week, but if youre new to the subject its where Id start. Its the frame around everything else youll read about what big tech companies are doing in response to the pandemic, from sophisticated contact tracing solutions to old-fashioned philanthropy. 
The most important thing to take away from that piece, as well as several others I have read this week, is that there is not a coordinated federal plan to manage the next phase of the crisis. Instead we have a president who says he wants to end lockdowns as soon as possible, despite lacking the authority to do so, and groups of governors on both coasts pledging to work together to manage the process on a regional basis. This seems likely to cause not a small degree of chaos, working against efforts to contain new outbreaks and undermining the well intentioned tech initiatives that are now percolating.
And we cant blame all of this on politics: even epidemiologists disagree on what the best path forward is. Heres Kai Kupferschmidt in Science:
What is the exit strategy? Weve managed to get to the life raft, says epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). But Im really unclear how we will get to the shore.
As they seek a path forward, governments around the world must triangulate the health of their citizens, the freedoms of their population, and economic constraints. Could schools be reopened? Restaurants? Bars? Can people go back to their offices? How to relax the lockdown is not something around which there is a scientific consensus, says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at HSPH. Most researchers agree that reopening society will be a long haul, marked by trial and error. Its going to have to be something that were going to have to take baby steps with, says Megan Coffee, an infectious disease researcher at New York University.
This uncertainty has huge implications for public health and the eventual recovery of the economy. And in the shorter term, it raises questions about how effective the Apple/Google collaboration on contact tracing will be, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman explores in The Verge today: 
The pandemic is moving at unprecedented speed, and public health experts are sprinting to build the tools they think might help bring it under control. Its a little bit of flying the plane while still building it, Dhillon says. Any automated contact tracing program would have to be carefully monitored to see how well it helps contain COVID-19, how people are interacting with it, and if its flagging more people than actually would be at risk from an exposure.
Whatever the systems eventually end up looking like, they have to be introduced alongside public health infrastructure to ensure they have as big an impact as possible. The tools cant be used in isolation, Liu says. You have to make sure you have the policies in place to support them. 
It seems likely that we will have those policies in place in California. But with President Trump framing the recovery as a partisan battle against Democratic governors, and people protesting stay-at-home orders already taking to the streets in Michigan, its hard to imagine an environment in which a coherent national response emerges.
A good question for tech giants right now is: what would you build in response to the pandemic if you knew there would never be a coordinated federal response? Are your interventions resilient to partisan warfare? Can they be?

A lesser concern: is Amazon getting stronger during the pandemic, or weaker?
On the stronger side, America is suddenly hugely dependent on the deliveries that Amazon provides. A huge number of local retail businesses may not survive the next several months, putting Amazon in an even stronger position to dominate e-commerce once the pandemic subsides. Jason Del Rey wrote about this possibility Friday at Recode: 
And then theres Amazon, which already accounted for nearly 40 percent of all US online retail sales thats around eight times more than its next competitor, Walmart. Before the pandemic, the US e-commerce industry only represented between 10 percent and 15 percent of overall retail. Now, that percentage seems likely to grow, setting up Amazon to have a bigger advantage over most other retailers, including Walmart.
With millions of Americans ordered to remain home, Amazon is now, more than ever, a lifeline for essentials for millions of people rather than just a convenient option for online shopping. Consumer spending on Amazon is up 35 percent from the same period last year, according to estimates from Facteus, a firm that analyzes more than 30 million daily payment card transactions to offer consumer spending insights to retailers and financial institutions. The labor numbers also reflect the companys growth; Amazon has hired 80,000 new workers in the past few weeks alone.
This seems to me to be a fairly airtight case that Amazon will come out of the pandemic stronger than before. At the same time, have you noticed how much of the company is in disarray? Each day brings a new story of COVID 19-related worker unrest, illness, or even death. Workers involved in organizing efforts have been fired in what they describe as retaliation. (Amazon denies they were fired for speaking out.) On Wednesday, France ordered the company to shutter its six warehouses in the country for several days to better assess the risk for contagion among its workforce there.
Its clear that these issues have had a significant effect on the quality of Amazons services during this time, as you may have noticed from the multi-week delays in receiving shipments of non-essential items and the nearly impossible task of ordering grocery delivery. (The company is currently adding new customers seeking grocery deliveries to a waitlist.)
I expect all those issues to get resolved in time, particularly as the company brings on board the tens of thousands of new workers it plans to hire. But I do wonder how the companys reputation for exploiting its workforce will haunt it as America re-opens. Theres already a significant swath of Americans who wont shop at Walmart over labor issues. I can imagine Amazon finding itself in a similar place among more wealthy and informed consumers assuming those consumers have any good alternatives to shop at.
* * * 
Finally: Zoom is an amazing tool for the moment. But while its equal to many tasks, its not ideal for almost any of them. 
Women in business meetings on Zoom find that it can be impossible to get a word in edgewise with the men.
People dating on Zoom find that etiquette makes it extremely difficult to know when to hang up.
Attendees of Zoom parties stare dead-eyed at the screen wondering if or when to speak.
I dont blame Zoom for not building software to address these and other shortcomings of video-chat based socializing. But it sure would be great if someone else did.

The Pentagons inspector general could not definitively determine whether the White House interfered with the procurement process for the JEDI contract because senior Defense Department officials were barred from answering verbal questions on the subject. Amazon sued the Defense Department last year, alleging that the Pentagon made several mistakes in its evaluation of bids. Heres Politicos Jacqueline Feldscher:
Trump repeatedly inserted himself into the JEDI review process in ways that presidents traditionally dont. In July, Trump said he would be asking the Pentagon to look at it very closely to see whats going on because he heard complaints about the review process from companies and lawmakers. Shortly after, the Pentagon put a contract award on hold so Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had recently taken the job, could review allegations that Amazon had been unfairly given an advantage for the contract.

But low- and middle-income countries have mostly reduced mortality rates through modern treatments like drugs and vaccines, without always building strong health systems to prevent the emergence of diseases.
Many of the gains we've seen over the last half-century have been against infectious diseases and children dying unnecessarily, Bollyky says. They may have masked the lack of progress in the broader well-being of societies and the capability of health systems to address health threats.
Fiscal regimes mandated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the 1980s and 1990s didnt help. They gutted budgets for public health and public infrastructure. International aid targeted initiatives like mass vaccination campaigns and disease-specific programs, which reduced deaths without necessarily improving overall health systems.
Many of those campaigns have been halted due to physical distancing measures as part of the response to Covid-19, which could lead to other problems. Millions of people deprived of vaccination and treatment could develop tuberculosis, measles, or polio over the next few months.
The global health community responded to past epidemics such as Ebola but has struggled to make sense of the social and economic dynamics of cities. There is little data in the scientific literature about the health needs of the billion people living in informal slums.
Responses to epidemics often tend to be quite short term; they're about controlling the epidemic, says Annie Wilkinson, an anthropologist and health systems researcher at the Institute of Development Studies. The big kind of emergency infrastructure rolls into town, and then it leaves. They're just getting to grips with this urban dimension.
That can lead to ill-suited policies. The World Health Organizations advice on Covid-19, for instance, is largely inapplicable in slums, where maintaining social distance is impossible in overcrowded housing. So is washing your hands regularly when there is no running water at home. In the slum of Mukuru, in Nairobi, private water vendors hiked the price of water jerricans amid increased demand in response to sanitation guidelines. Stay-at-home orders are impractical when a day off work means there wont be food on the table at the end of the day.
There are big questions about how appropriate lockdowns are for low-income settings, Wilkinson says. But she says theres been little discussion of potential alternatives.
In some places, community groups are stepping in where health systems are lacking. Grassroots NGOs are coordinating food and mask donations in low-income neighborhoods in Mumbai through WhatsApp groups. In the Mfuleni township near Cape Town, South Africa, residents have planted urban gardens to grow and sell food locally. Muungano wa Wanavijiji, the Kenyan federation of slum dwellers, is tracking data on Covid-19 cases, as well as prevention and treatment activities, in the countrys informal settlements. Researchers are using the data to monitor the impact of localized initiatives by community workers, such as handwashing stations.
There's big questions about how appropriate lockdowns are for low-income settings.

Support can come from unusual places. In Rio de Janeiro, drug gangs made headlines when they moved to enforce a curfew in some favelas, after Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro questioned the seriousness of the pandemic.
One of the really unique realities of cities is that they tend to be more nimble than a lot of other forms of government, says Boyce, the Georgetown researcher. They've enabled this form of creativity to do what they want and operationalize their guidance."

It has to bewithout one, the Before Time is never coming back. More than a hundred candidates are cooking, most still preliminary. A handful are in early human studies, three in Phase II clinical trials designed to see if they actually confer immunity to the disease.
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
But nobody thinks finding a winner will be easy; vaccine development typically takes years. Thats time researchers and governments dont feel like they have. Globally, more than 4 million people have gotten sick, and 280,000 have died. People sheltering in place and the closure of businesses has cost 30 million jobs in the United States alone. As the famed virologist Peter Piot wrote in an account of his own experience after getting sick with Covid-19, the only real exit strategy from this crisis is a vaccine that can be rolled out worldwide.
Even if scientists do develop a safe, broadly effective vaccine, nobody knows how to give it to billions of people. Itll be scarce at first anddepending on how it works and how its madepotentially difficult to transport. They have to figure out how to deploy it now, so that a planets worth of people in desperate need will be able to get it.
One approach might be to initially give the vaccine only to members of specific groups. Of course, then someone will have to decide which groups get priority. That order will be hard to figure out. Even if the answer is whoever is most at risk of dying, the epidemiological data still isnt clear on which group meets that criterion. Older people are more likely to get severely ill and die, but researchers are still trying to work out the role that children play as carriers, for example. The more fine-grained that is, the more we can define the risk groups, both with respect to how much risk they have of getting infected and the risk of severe outcomes, says Andreas Handel, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Georgia.
And most at risk isnt necessarily the right answer. Maybe people at high risk of catching the disease but with a lower risk of bad outcomes should be first in line. That could mean prioritizing people with high-exposure jobs that involve a lot of public contact, or that could mean addressing the systemic problems that have led to poorer, African American, and Latinx people facing more illness and death from Covid-19. Thats not easy. It could be groups with underlying health conditions, or people who, because of the kind of work theyre doing, cant avoid contactlike health care workers, police officers, grocery store workers, Handel says.
Alternatively, maybe the vaccine should go to the groups for whom itd do the most good, immunologically speaking. The vaccine against seasonal influenza, for example, isnt as effective in older people. If a Covid-19 vaccine has the same limitation, thats a big problem.
It could also be a solution. Maybe the best bet is giving the vaccine to people who mount the biggest immune response to ityoung, healthy people, perhapsto start building a roundabout sort of herd immunity. It could be conceptually possible that its better to give it to age groups that dont need it as much, but indirectly protect the other age groups, Handel says. The question then is, should you focus on giving the vaccine to those who dont directly benefit the most because their risk is lower, but if theyre vaccinated, they cant get it and pass it on to their parents?"

Places like r/LastImages provide people with an outlet for them to express their feelings.
To share these images is in part social rite, and during Covid, a much more important ritual given the inability for most to participate in funeral services, says Brian Carroll, a professor in communications at Berry College and co-author of the 2010 study. I think it's also a defense against anxiety and feelings of loss. Photography is a tool of power. With photography, we can miniaturize, memorialize, contain and collectall activities of agency. And to get condolences, even from strangers, sort of ratifies these activities.
Below users posts, other anonymous users share condolences and heartfelt comments. Your mum looked like she was full of love for all her family, reads one comment on Tweedles post. Such a beautiful smile. My heart aches for the loss you and your family are suffering, says another.
However, keeping the subreddit free from trolls can be difficult, David Li, one of the lead moderators, admits. The subreddit employs a bot to automatically remove any posts which contain an offensive trigger word, and enforces a strict zero tolerance policy, permanently banning people on their first offense. The most difficult part of our job is to track down rule breaking comments and remove them quickly, explains Li. One rotten apple spoils the barrel and we don't want the original poster to see these comments that could ruin their internet memorial.
Overall, Tweedle says, his experience reading the comments was a positive one. Some comments made my heart a little lighter, he says. A few comments disappointed me. Someone said that 5G towers had taken my mom away from me. A lot of people jumped on whoever posted that and downvoted them.
For some of these users, posting the last pictures of their loved one is akin to creating a digital shrine, along with the comments underneath. Bassett relates this to a roadside memorial, which marks the last place a person was alive. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen outlined in a paper that Facebook RIP memorial pages, popular in 2014, werelike posts on r/LastImagesin essence virtual spontaneous shrines in honor of the deceased.
For Reddit user SaiMoi, who posted the last picture her friend sent her on WhatsApp, her motivation was simple. I needed to talk about her, to share the person I knew her to be, and my own grief, she says, which she couldnt do with other people. Although she felt self-conscious before posting it, she says that the therapeutic benefit won out. Crying through the kindness and empathy of strangers relieved some of the ache.
John Troyer, senior lecturer in death and society at the University of Bath and author of Technologies of the Human Corpse, argues that places like r/LastImages are a natural digital progression from memorials of the past. I think the internet seems to have given [this tradition] a kind of new attention, Troyer says.
Social media has made mourning a more public affair. Carroll says that many more people can participate in the memorializing, the grieving and the comforting with ease and low stakes. What we're seeing on r/LastImages and the like are sort of always-on, always-open, global weak ties memorial services, he thinks, adding that this aspect of grieving is healthy. The strength of weak tiesbonds with strangers or acquaintanceshave been shown to have an effect on wellbeing. Rituals of mourning as we're seeing in social media are breaking down these walls and changing norms for what is acceptable.
Ultimately, for people posting to r/LastImages, the process offers some catharsis. In a way, Reddit kind of immortalized [my dad] and made his passing much easier on my sister and me, thinks Garcia. All of the comments were beautiful. They were warm and loving. Just off one photo, they fell in love with this man whose ground I worshipped my whole life.

At least five proposals to launch an inquiry have been circulated in the House of Representatives, according to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service.
Given the colossal catastrophe we've experienced, there needs to be something of that ilk as a way of pulling the country together and laying down in a very clear way what happens next, says J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC, think tank. It needs to be done with investigative authority, and it's going to require exceptional leadership and speed.
We shouldnt think that, once we get to a vaccinewhenever that isand once were able to arrest this virus, that well be able to rest easy, Morrison continues. We are in a new era of more frequent, higher-impact, higher-velocity zoonotic threats.
The first task of any coronavirus equivalent of the 9/11 Commission would be simply to establish one narrative of the pandemic, because Americans have experienced its effects so differently depending on where they live. (New York, the hardest-hit state, has had more than 388,000 cases; Montana, with slightly more than 600 cases, has suffered least.) But just as with the World Trade Center attacks, examining how the US failed this year will require acknowledging the multiple ignored warnings, some from the federal government and others from academicresearch, that an overwhelming pandemic was on the way. (Within Morrisons CSIS, the Commission on Strengthening Americas Health Security predicted last November: The United States remains woefully ill-prepared to respond to global health security threats.)
But another part of the examination of 9/11 involved creating new structures in the government to stand up defenses against future attacks, such as the Department of Homeland Security. The already evident needs for preventing another pandemic catastrophe include shoring up deep stockpiles of supplies such as medications and personal protective equipment. Covid-19 might lead also to new federal initiatives or federal funding of academic initiatives. Last week, for instance, researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, which in September 2019 wrote one of the reports predicting a coming pandemic, proposed that Congress create a national center for epidemic forecasting, a disease-prediction agency modeled on the federal entities that warn Americans against catastrophic weather in time to protect themselves.
The way this epidemic has gone has been the US government reaching out in an ad hoc way to modelers, who are mostly in universities or in the private sector, and getting them to answer questions on the fly, says Tom Ingelsby, the centers director and an infectious disease physician. We would never accept that for predicting hurricanes.
At the same time that they made that proposal, the Hopkins researchers also presented Congress with a plan for a $1.5 billion program, shared across multiple federal agencies, that could rapidly produce antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic tests when theyre needed. That price tag indicates what one of the struggles of learning from Covid-19 is going to be: deciding how much money the country is willing to commit in advance to protect against threats whose arrival is unpredictable.
Its attitudes toward spending, after all, that helped turn the US Covid-19 response into a catastrophe. That includes both federal cutstake the National Security Council disbanding its global health security team and the White House slashing the CDCs budgetand private sector decisions, such as corporations offshoring mask manufacturing in order to reduce their labor costs.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Perplexingly, theres another facet of homeland security for which the US has no difficulty organizing long-term spending. The Department of Defense forecasts its weapons needs and designsand procures its jets and transport vehiclesover decades. It commits federal money years in advance of deploying anything it buys."

Candidate vaccines and potential drugs spend years progressing through lab studies, then animal studies, and then tests in humans. The current trials are able to move so fast because the National Institutes of Health is permitting vaccine-makers to skip or delay animal testing. Instead, vaccine-makers are taking their formulas straight into human testing, in three steps called phases.
Phase 1, usually done in fewer than a hundred volunteers, tests for the vaccine candidates safety and also tries to determine the right dose. Phase 2 expands the pool to several hundred people, continues to look for safety issues and side effects, and starts to examine whether the vaccine evokes an immune response. Phase 3 uses thousands of peoplefor the current vaccine trials, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000who are divided between those getting the vaccine candidate and others getting a placebo, to determine whether the formula actually prevents a disease.
The Phase 3 trials are the stage in which location becomes crucial. If people in the unprotected placebo arm turn out not to have been exposed to the disease, something that would be determined by testing, that means the trial participants who received the vaccine will not have been exposed, eitherand thus, that there has been no real test of whether the vaccine works or not.
Three vaccine candidates, by the company Moderna, the University of Oxford with the company AstraZeneca, and the companies Pfizer and BioNTech, have passed to Phase 2 and are scheduled to start broad Phase 3 tests this summer. Another 11 are in Phase 1 or, for speed, a combined Phase 1/2. In addition, on Monday the Chinese pharma company CanSino Biologics announced that it will begin giving its vaccine candidate to Chinas military, effectively creating a giant Phase 3 trial.
But to conduct a Phase 3, you cant just start passing out shots; running a trial requires substantial personnel and physical resources. Ideally, you need a staff that is already focusing their primary research work on doing clinical trials of vaccines, laboratory capacity that is already doing this work, a surveillance system capable of detecting cases, and a good institutional review board, says Walter Orenstein, a physician and associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center.
Frequently, those resources reside in a place called a vaccine treatment and evaluation unit, or VTEU, a division within a research university or medical center that receives NIH funding to be a kind of rapid-response unit for testing vaccines. (Emorys Woodruff Health Science Center houses a VTEU, and is part of the Moderna vaccines Phase 2. Orenstein is not involved in that study.) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases created the VTEUs in 1962 out of the recognition that recruiting and managing volunteers and arranging lab studies and processing trial results were specialized skills that any one university or company might need infrequently, but that the nation would need access to at all times. That they exist speaks to the amount of infrastructure that is needed to run Phase 3 trials at all, let alone ones that may need to pivot if disease incidence in a location isnt what developers forecast.
Derek Lowe, a drug-development chemist and author of the long-running blog In the Pipeline, has been forecasting that companies might face difficulty. The logistics of setting up a Phase 2 or 3 trial are not exactly instantaneous, so it's not like you can say, Okay, we're going to test in this one spot, (when) the one spot keeps jumping around, he says. These are going to have to beand they probably were always going to belarge multicenter efforts, all across the country or in different countries simultaneously. Thats a bigger, more expensive way to do it. But some of these areas are going to turn out not to be too fruitful by the time you've got the trial underway, whereas others will."

A stately, Depression-era brick structure on a not-so-stately stretch of parking lots and auto glass shops, the space once held the workshops of a vocational college. Later, it became home to the city's boxing cluba sign still hangs in the room that held the old ring. More recently, the space was used for storage. Its basically a warehouse, Wolf says. But a few weeks ago, the Annexs ancillary purpose became an asset. Old items were cleared out, the walls and floors scrubbed down, and rooms stocked with an array of lab tools and boxes of test tubes and pipettes. The result is perhaps the worlds most unassuming Covid-19 testing lab, where Wolf now presides over his fire crew as pipetter-in-chief. 
At the start of a shift, the firefighters don gowns, goggles, and medical masks. Then they await a stream of city workerspermit issuers, police officers, lifeguardswho drop by on their way to work. Under careful supervision, each visitor spits into a vial. And for the rest of the day, the firefighters perform the tests, heating up the samples and pipetting liquids from one test tube to the next. Were slow at it, says Wolf. But like any emergency we respond to, we have to work together. No bickering. No errors. We get it done. If all goes well, theyll have results by lunch. They await a simple change of color in the test tubes: Pink is the all-clear; no virus detected. Yellow is evidence of SARS-CoV-2.
The technology used in the tests is called LAMP, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Its similar to PCRor polymerase chain reactionthe common way of diagnosing Covid-19, in that it looks for genetic traces of the virus. But its a stripped-down process, requiring fewer chemical ingredients, test tubes, and equipment. Typically, the method is used to test for diseases like Zika and dengue fever in places that dont have lab accessor else by farmers who want to find out what pathogen ails their soybeans. But in Racine, its part of an experiment: to see how a cheaper, simpler test, if done frequently enough, might hold outbreaks at bay. Instead of sending samples off to a hospital or lab, and potentially waiting days for results, could you test for Covid-19 from the back of a van, or outside a school, or in a city-owned former boxing gym?
The tests had found their way to the shores of Lake Michigan by way of Chris Mason, a professor at Cornell-Weill Medical School, Racine native, and younger brother of the citys mayor. Earlier this spring, Mason had published a preprint of his work on LAMP, and then posted it on Facebook and Twitter. It caught his brother's attention. Their hometown, much like everywhere else, lacked adequate testing for the new virus, and in April, Masons brother called, inquiring about his research. The mayor told him that cases were surging, and asked if the test could be put to use.
The idea behind LAMP testing, according to Mason, is to give every town or city its own capacity to test closer to home. While few places have their own clinically certified labs, everybody has a fire department, he says. Because people can have a Covid-19 infection without symptoms, the major barrier to any return to a semblance of normal lifeback to school, to workis the need to test lots of people, regularly, whether they show signs of Covid-19 or not. An estimate from Paul Romer, a Nobel Prizewinning economist at New York University, puts the requirement for doing so safely at more than 35 million tests per day."

We are living history every hour right now, for better or for worse, with little sense of which it is.
In the wake of 9/11, numerous organizations went out and captured critical memories of that day, repositories and archives I drew upon for my research years after the fact. Yet every one of the 2,000 oral histories I read about 9/11 was done after the fact. Every person knew how it ended and what their story was. Today, none of us know how this story will endfor ourselves, our jobs, our families, our country, or for our world.

Capturing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, how this crisis unfolds and how our thinking about it changes, is critical both to understanding it now as well as to the stories we someday will tell about it. That need to document and remember history as we live it is the genesis for a new project that Im hoping youll help with: Covid Spring, a week-by-week oral history, published here at WIRED, documenting Americas response to this pandemic through the words of all of us living through it.
One of the things that became clear to me during my 9/11 research was that the history that we teach and tell about the September 11th attacksthat the attacks began at 8:46 am ET and ended 102 minutes later with the collapse of the North Tower, that there were four planes and three crash sites, in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvaniais a much neater and cleaner history than the messy reality of what any of us experienced. None of us that day, from the first responders to ordinary office workers to the president of the United States, knew any of that as the attacks unfolded. No one understood when it began, nor when it ended. It took hours to understand how many planes were involvedand it took days to understand why one ended up in a field in Pennsylvania.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
Theres a big difference, it turns out, between experiencing history and writing history. My goal with this oral history project will be to capture the messiness and uncertainty as this pandemic unfolds. As part of Covid Spring, WIRED will publish a new chapter every Friday, weaving together as many stories as we can from across the country about living through this crisis, trying to capture the story of American government, American business, American life, and the titanic task ahead for our health care system.
Just think about all the things that just a couple weeks ago seemed so normala trip to your favorite restaurant, a trip to the hardware store, an afternoon browsing at a store, a drink with a friend after a day at the officethat today sound simultaneously exotic, dangerous, and impossible. Think of all the terms we now rattle off in conversation (flattening the curve, R-naught, N95, social distancing) that would have been all-but meaningless at the start of 2020. What are we doing now that will simultaneously feel so strange to where this story takes us in two weeks? A month? A year? What dont we know now that a month from now will be blindingly obvious to our future selves?

Coming up with a case definition is a first step in conducting surveillance for what might be a new disease. With it, the CDC learned by mid-May of more than 100 US kids with the condition, three of whom had died.
On August 7, the agency updated those numbers. As of the end of July, 570 US kids had experienced that constellation of shock, heart problems, and gastrointestinal problems; had blood work that indicated inflammation was going on in their bodies; and were positive for Covid-19. Many of them were seriously ill: 364 needed to be treated in an ICU, and 10 died. In many of them, several organsheart, lungs, kidneys and brainwere affected, which earned the disorder its agreed-on new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children name. Almost one in five of the survivors was left with kidney damage or with weakened arteries and aneurysms for which they will need long-term drug treatment and monitoring.
Many of those cases came through a research network that Randolph supervises, the Overcoming Covid project, which collects case reports from 70 pediatric referral hospitals across the US and is collecting blood and respiratory samples from patients to get ready to launch clinical studies in children with acute Covid-19 and with MIS-C. The network published its first accounting in June, uncovering 186 child and teen patients in 26 states and confirming the novel syndrome was causing serious and life-threatening illness, including four deaths. I think people are very cognizant of this now, Randolph says. Theyre recognizing less severe cases as well, and defining that there is a spectrum of illness.
It seems clear at this point that MIS-C is not Kawasaki: The children affected by the new syndrome are school-aged and teenagers, whereas Kawasaki occurs mostly in toddlers. And almost every child reported with MIS-C shows evidence of having had a novel coronavirus infection, whereas the underlying cause of Kawasaki is unknown. But the similarities between the two are enough to light up the science of both.
If you frame the question as, Are these two diseases the same? the answer to that is: clearly not, says Jane Burns, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego. If by the same you mean, Are these immunologic responses in specifically genetically susceptible children, that happened as a result of an exposure that these children had, and then they make an unusual immune response to that exposure? Then yes, they're exactly the same.
That could be a critical insight, because its actually not uncommon for children to have inflammatory responses to an infection, and for physicians to never figure out just what the cause was. Still, it could take a while for researchers to gather enough data to understand the immune processes that create MIS-C, even with the help of networks such as Randolphs.
Learning what a genetic predisposition might be requires tons of samples, because its unlikely to be due to a single rare mutation, says Burns, who has seen 10 MIS-C patients in her center. As with Kawasaki disease, she said, Its likely to be a complex pathway that allows for a range of responses, from very mild disease to the most serious versions that put children into ICUs.
Finding a genetic link will be challenging because, viewed simply by the numbers, MIS-C is rare, occurring in only about two children out of 100,000. Researchers worry, though, that it is not as unusual as those numbers make it seem, because the MIS-C case definition that causes a child to be counted requires proof of either infection or exposureand as has been observed many times since the pandemic started, children can carry the virus without symptoms, so their cases are not consistently recognized or recorded."

""While this decision comes at a time of universal uncertainty, we take the safety and health of our guests, staff, and community very seriously,"" the festival's promoter Goldenvoice said in a statement posted by the Coachella Twitter account. ""We urge everyone to follow the guidelines and protocols put forth by public health officials."" 
Goldenvoice added that the festival would be postponed until October 2020, and that any purchases for the original dates would be honored for the rescheduled weekend. Goldenvoice will notify purchasers by March 13 about refunds. 
The festival was to feature headliners like Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott, and Frank Ocean. The Los Angeles Timesreports that the two weekends were estimated to draw in 250,000 to the Coachella Valley. Goldenvoice did not state whether the more than 150 acts who were supposed to perform during the original April dates will also reschedule. 
Coachella's postponement follows a string of events canceled because of the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control report 647 cases as of Tuesday, but other models suggest much higher numbers that aren't symptomatic yet. On March 6, South by Southwest canceled its Austin, Texas events. On Monday, Ireland canceled all Saint Patrick's Day parades. Both Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden canceled their rallies in Cleveland on Tuesday night. 
Coachella, at least, is hopeful that it'll return.

""There's a calendar to launch more 5G cities over the next quarter, [but] we're not doing marketing launches right now just because of everything that's going on,"" she says. ""We're on track for the additional 30 this year, and we continue to expand coverage in the 30 that we launched last year. In Chicago, we have three times the nodes we did a year ago.""
Verizon's 5G launched almost exactly a year ago in Chicago and Minneapolis. In Chicago at the time, coverage was restricted only to a few sites in the city center. If Verizon's current coverage map is to be believed, it now covers the entire Loop, West Loop, and River North areas, as well as major avenues in much of the rest of the city.
AT&amp;T last announced a 5G expansion about a month ago, just as the COVID lockdowns were beginning, saying that it was expanding its low-band 5G from 80 to 100 markets. T-Mobile's president of technology Neville Ray said on April 1 that his carrier was rolling out mid-band 5G in Philadelphia, although he stopped short of calling it a launch.
Because of its very short range, Verizon's millimeter-wave 5G system is harder to set up (but faster) than the low-band and mid-band systems the other carriers have been most recently touting. Verizon will also get mid-band 5G using dynamic spectrum sharing, splitting existing frequency bands with 4G, ""probably during the third quarter of this year,"" Hemmer says.
New ""intelligent beamforming"" software will help with range from the millimeter-wave base stations, Hemmer says. In early March, I estimated those have about an 800-foot radius right now. Fortunately, Verizon won't need to do any more hardware swaps to increase its range, but it's waiting on that software, she says, without giving a time frame for it to show up.
COVID-19 lockdowns present a unique challenge for wireless carriers and ISPs. Their work is considered essentialthese are the networks the rest of us rely on for work and school. It turns out that in cities where Verizon's crews can stay outside, laying fiber and planting millimeter-wave 5G hardware on lampposts and light poles, they're actually finding it easier going because of clear streets. That's the rollout style we've seen in Chicago and Providence.
""When we're outside and we're attaching to city furniture, for the most part we're able to continue that work,"" Hemmer says. ""In some cases we have cities where the streets don't have traffic on them ... and a couple of cities have given us wider construction hours.""
But cities where the carrier needs access to building rooftops, such as I've seen in New York and Dallas, are more on hold to keep Verizon's staff safe. Access to buildings can also be a problem when landlords are locked down or absent. ""Right now we're choosing not to put our employees inside multi-dwelling units,"" Hemmer says.
That caution extends to testing and development labs as well. Hemmer says Verizon is doing as much ""remote testing"" as it can with its equipment providers to minimize the number of engineers it needs to send into the office. ""We do have labs we own, and they go in every day, but we send in the minimum amount of people, we do deep cleaning, and we don't have anyone flying in,"" she says.
The most recent data from our sibling company Ookla Speedtest shows that US internet networks are, by and large, holding up under the strain of the COVID-19 period. Fixed download speeds are down only 5 percent and mobile download speeds are down 3 percent over last month, Speedtest says on its blog.

 (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be following some of the central pages of President Donald Trump's playbook. And the results seem to be heading in an even more catastrophic direction. 
In the past seven days, the World Health Organization reports that Russia has added over 75,000 coronavirus cases, more than double the nearest European nation, the United Kingdom. Even more troubling: The growth rate of the disease was 56%. Moscow has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the country, with only scattered clusters in other major cities like St. Petersburg, and as far as some oil and gas fields in the more remote reaches of Siberia.
In Moscow, the mayor himself has conceded that numbers may be vastly under-counted. Last week, in an interview on Russia 24 television, Sergey Sobyanin said he believes the real Covid-19 count in his city was around 300,000, or more than triple the official government count of 92,676. A new Financial Times study even estimates that death toll may be higher than the official count by as much as 70%. And indeed, residents are largely taking to heart the government's warning to social distance and stay at home. 
""Sometimes I'll be walking around and it seems like it's the middle of the night and somebody just turned the lights on,"" David Grout, a translator, musician, and longtime American resident of Moscow said in a Zoom interview, describing how empty the usually crowded streets are these days. Use of masks is frequent, he said, adding that the city's center ""has its own sort of rules.""
Indeed, in St. Petersburg, Susan Katz, a longtime American citizen married to a Russian, told me that she estimates barely 10% of people on the streets wear masks. Starting on Tuesday, she said, masks will be required in St. Petersburg. There is officially a ban on people going to parks, but only some have yellow tape around them, and the weather has been idyllic as spring began arriving. She has seen few police on the streets enforcing any regulations. 
Which suggests the first page in Putin's playbook. The president is clearly stepping back from what rapidly seems to be turning into the greatest single challenge to his presidency, placing administration of the crisis in the hands of governors and mayors, most of whom owe their job to him in any event. 
Putin himself has largely disappeared from public view, confining his appearances to an occasional broadcast from a windowless room in his residence against a drab backdrop. In part, Putin's seclusion may be attributed to the fact that his minister of construction Vladimir Yakushev, culture minister Olga Lyubimova, and prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, all have come down with the coronavirus. 
On Saturday, Putin who loves vast displays of power and ceremony, told his people they were ""invincible."" These words were meant to have been spoken at a very different venue--the lavish May 9 celebration of Victory Day, the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II that was to have featured a parade through Red Square with Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping at his side. Canceled. Earlier, a nationwide referendum for a constitutional change that would effectively have bestowed on him presidency for life was postponed indefinitely. And, perhaps most troubling, his approval rating has plunged to 59% -- the lowest in 20 years, according to the independent Levada Center.
While officially, the government is doing all the right things to stem the vast economic impact of the coronavirus, these measures are not taking hold on large stretches of the population that are most seriously impacted. ""Putin not only doesn't control the situation, but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,"" Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British think tank Chatham House told The Guardian newspaper. ""He cannot adjust ... I think partly Putin's lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position."" 
The government has, nominally, taken the right measures. At the end of January, Russia closed its land borders with China, the entry of all foreign nationals was banned on March 18, and on March 30 it closed all borders with the outside world. On April 16, Putin introduced an economic stimulus plan to provide aid businesses in the form of interest free loans and employee payments, adding to an announcement from Mistushin a month earlier of a 300 billion rubles stimulus (about $4 billion). On April 1, the Prime Minister also revealed 1.4 trillion rubles (barely $19 billion) in total economic aid. The fact is that plunging oil prices and western sanctions have been wreaking havoc on the Russian economy even as Covid-19 began arriving.
But this help has not filtered down to many economic sectors, leading to potentially catastrophic results. Grout said local websites have reported cases of people being mugged on the street for groceries. Still, the shops are full and there are no real shortages. The question is how long people, out of work and sheltering, will be able to afford shopping.
""Russia has experienced a delayed beginning to the epidemic and is now seeing that increase in cases,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme told me. ""Russia has also increased its testing both in the urban areas and outside and the increased numbers may reflect partly that, but there's also been an increase in deaths which means the disease is clearly having an impact."" Then he added that Russia ""can learn some of the lessons that have been learned at great cost in Asia, in North America and in Western Europe."" 
The big question is whether Putin can learn and, more importantly, apply these lessons. He's already talked three times with Xi Jinping, leader of China where only the most draconian measures resulted in a dramatic turnaround in that nation's Covid-19 spread. Moreover, is Putin in any sense prepared to take such measures in a country where he clearly has little of Xi's ability simply to crack down on a people who may already be becoming restless. 
Last week, in a telephone call, Trump promised Putin to deliver a supply of ventilators, observing that Russia has had a ""hard time"" with the disease
On Monday, in a nationwide address, Putin took another page out of Trump's playbook and, though cases are continuing to mount nationwide at more than double the pace of any other nation in Europe, said that beginning on Tuesday, ""the national period of non-working days will be over for all sectors of the economy."" Still, he said regions or municipalities could keep the regulations in place if necessary. 
The fact is that both leaders could learn quite a lot from each other as the disease progresses through its various, pernicious stages. What is equally clear from both is that a hands-off approach or ducking reality and the accompanying hard choices can only lead to catastrophic results -- medically and politically."

The agreement comes after a protracted period of negotiation among the various constituencies -- including actors, directors and crews -- and relies on extensive testing, temperature checks, cleaning measures and physical distancing when possible. The parties also acknowledge that revisions might be necessary going forward.
Certain activities, such as writing and casting, are still encouraged to be conducted virtually whenever possible. At the same time, other parts of production -- including live studio audiences -- are being discouraged, and must be conducted with restrictions like social-distancing measures when used.
Actors and other performers, it's noted, are ""most vulnerable because they cannot wear PPE when cameras are rolling, and frequently will not be able to engage in physical distancing."" That will require greater testing frequency for them and those with whom they are in close contact.
There are some activities, such as makeup and fight scenes, where stronger safeguards aren't possible, the report acknowledges.
The plans have been submitted to officials in New York and California. But movie and TV production takes place all over the world, including Europe Canada and New Zealand, where work on the next ""Avatar"" movies is already scheduled to resume after a quarantine period.
The guidelines rely on the ability to respond appropriately if personnel contract the virus, and educating those on movie and TV sets, with a designated compliance officer. Efforts will also be made to ""assess health/wellness of all personnel prior to entry onto set.""
There are still plenty of questions regarding how all this will work practically, and significantly, how much it's going to cost. As Variety noted, the report's initial draft didn't specifically address how the expense of ""conducting extensive testing, cleaning and safety monitoring will be covered, and who will pay for it.""
The guidelines specify that personal protective equipment be worn, and provided ""to all cast and crew at no cost.""
The plan was produced by the Industry-Wide Labor Management Safety Committee Task Force, which was formed specifically for that purpose, with input from epidemiologists and sanitation experts."

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book ""Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos."" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable event on Monday: ""I'm taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah. Couple of weeks ago, I started taking it. Cause I think it's good, I've heard a lot of good stories.""
This admission about his use of hydroxychloroquine makes Trump's previous musings about using disinfectant to treat the coronavirus look sage. The President can call on the best scientists and doctors in the world for medical advice, and he comes up with this? Trump's own FDA in late April warned of the dangers of taking hydroxychloroquine outside of a hospital or a clinical study setting ""due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" 
Even Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto warned his viewers not to follow the President's example, saying, ""If you are in a risky population here, and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you."" (Trump swiftly slapped Cavuto down on Twitter.)
The President has made any number of other non-scientific claims about the coronavirus, including that warm weather will take care of the virus (don't count on it, says his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), or that the US had coronavirus ""totally under control,"" (see today's death toll of more than 91,000) or that we are ""very close to a vaccine"" (not likely, medical scientists say).
It's Trump's disregard for science that prompted the leading medical journal The Lancet to publish an unusual editorial over the weekend saying that ""Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics."" 
But he is not the only Trump to play fast and loose with the reality of this contagion: The apple falleth not far from the tree. A day before his father's stunning hydroxychloroquine admission, Eric Trump told Fox News that Democrats are milking the pandemic for political gain and trying to prevent his father from holding campaign rallies. And he predicted that after the presidential election on November 3 the ""coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen."" 
In fact, as the number of dead inches, day by day, toward 100,000, there is widespread agreement among scientists, including Trump's CDC Director, Robert Redfield, that a second wave of the pandemic will likely hit the US later this year. Redfield explained last month, ""There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through...We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time."" 
Not to be outdone, Donald Trump Jr. recently defended remarks he'd made on air before Fox News' large audience in February, when he suggested that ""for Democrats to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness."" He told Axios earlier this month that he was ""entitled to speak with such hyperbole."" 
Meanwhile, a week ago presidential son-in-law, senior adviser and savior of worlds Jared Kushner mused to a Time reporter that he couldn't ""commit one way or the other"" about the possibility of postponing the presidential election (neither he nor the President are legally empowered to do this). 
And at the end of April, Kushner touted to Fox News the ""great success"" of the Trump administration in fighting the coronavirus. Kushner told the network that he hopes the US will be ""really rocking again"" by July. The official death toll for Americans is already the worst in the world. A month and a half out, we're not rocking.
Jared's wife Ivanka, another senior adviser to the President, who is her father, also took one for the team by disregarding federal guidelines on not taking discretionary travel during the pandemic when she traveled from DC to her family golf club in New Jersey in mid-April.
First Lady Melania Trump? She has been strangely absent throughout this crisis despite her ""Be Best"" campaign that is focused on the well-being of American children -- and at a time when many children are living through what might be the most difficult experience of their lives.
Trump has cast the battle with coronavirus as a war and ordinary Americans as ""warriors."" But if the President is the general, he is leading his troops into battle armed with misinformation. Presumably, he is trying to control the narrative as he charges on toward the election -- and by doing so he appears more concerned with winning the election battle rather than beating the coronavirus. 
What an unbearable sadness for Americans to have such incompetence at the helm during the worst crisis in eight decades."

Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images
Chinese operatives helped amplify a viral text message that falsely claimed President Trump was going to instate a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, reports The New York Times. US officials said the operatives were engaging in disinformation tactics similar to the ones Russia used in 2016.
The rumor, which gained traction around mid-March, claimed to be coming from someone close to the White House. It said Trump was doing to lock down the country to stop the spread of COVID-19. Please be advised, one version of the text message began. Within 48 to 72 hours the President will evoke what is called the Stafford Act. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.
On March 15th, the White House National Security Council debunked the myth in a tweet, saying: Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.
Operatives created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it
While Chinese operatives did not create the message, intelligence agencies in the United States determined that they helped circulate it across different platforms, including on Facebook and over SMS. Those efforts enabled the messages to catch the attention of enough people that they then spread on their own, with little need for further work by foreign agents, the NYT reports.
In some cases, the agents created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it. Those people then sent it out to their networks, allowing the myth to gain traction.
The lockdown rumor isnt the first coronavirus myth that has been linked to China. Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, spread misinformation that the coronavirus may not have originated in Wuhan, and was instead brought by the US military. CDC was caught on the spot, he tweeted on March 12th. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied that they had anything to do with the viral text message, telling the NYT,The relevant statements are complete nonsense and not worth refuting."

Instacart will expand its COVID-19 sick pay to include more gig workers as part of an agreement with the attorney general for Washington, DC. Under the agreement, the company is also launching a telemedicine pilot in the DC area to remotely diagnose shoppers who believe they may have contracted the disease, and provide childcare assistance pay to eligible workers while schools are closed.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing
In March, Instacart announced that employees who were quarantined or tested positive for COVID-19 would receive 14 days of sick pay, meant to encourage them to stay home rather than spreading the disease further. But getting that pay has proven difficult for shoppers who have often been blocked from the benefit either by the unavailability of tests or confusion around which agencies are authorized to recommend quarantine.
In May, a Verge investigation found that Instacarts sick pay was difficult to access in practice, with little clear logic as to when claims were granted or denied. Out of eight shoppers who spoke to us, only three successfully received the benefit, often because of unique efforts on their part. 
Under the new policy, anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 by their health care provider would be eligible for sick pay even if they have not received a positive test. Instacart will also allow shoppers to actively seek a diagnosis through a new telemedicine system, administered through Doctor on Demand. Instacart also pledged to provide sick pay to shoppers who live in the same residence as someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, seeing them as particularly at risk of contracting the disease.
The new policy will still require documentation whether of a quarantine order or a positive diagnosis and the agreement does not contain any provisions for improving how the company processes those requests. Still, DC Attorney General Ken Racine said the new measures were vital to preventing further spread of the ongoing pandemic.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing, said Racine. During this pandemic, grocery delivery workers are risking their health to connect District residents to essential goods. Instacarts new policy will ensure that workers who are sick can stay home and seek care, and it helps protect their colleagues, consumers, and the public during this crisis. 
While the agreement was obtained through legal channels, theres been no allegation that Instacart acted illegally, and the agreement does not contain any admission of wrongdoing.
Instacart president Nilam Ganenthiran put the agreement in sunnier terms. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our team has been singularly focused on supporting the health and safety of our shopper community, he said in a statement. Were proud to partner with Attorney General Racine to expand our offerings and continue supporting our valued shopper community."

[extreme Stefon voice]: This story has everything: A high-speed super-yacht, a secret disaster strike force, a Google co-founder, and strawberry ice cream. 
The Daily Beasts Mark Harris has a wild story about Global Support and Development (GSD), a disaster charity founded by Sergey Brin thats being run by his former bodyguards. The story opens detailing how GSD provided disaster relief in the form of medical care and road-clearing crews after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas last year.
For the past five years, GSD has been quietly using high-tech systems to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance during high-profile disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These range from drones and super-yachts to a gigantic new airship that the outfit apparently hopes will make it easier to get aid supplies into disaster zones. 
And just as Google famously treatsor, pre-COVID-19 lockdown, treatedemployees to catered lunches, free gyms, and on-site massages, some of GSDs humanitarian workers have enjoyed strawberry ice cream and freshly laundered clothes on board Brins super-yacht during disaster deployments. 
The organization got its start in 2015 after Cyclone Pam pounded Vanuatu. Brins $80 million yacht, the Dragonfly, was sailing nearby with a doctor and paramedics on board, and the crew decided to spring into action. 
Making landfall at remote islands north of Vanuatus capital Port Vila, the Dragonflys team reportedly moved 62 metric tons of fresh water ashore, treated over 250 patients, facilitated three medical evacuations, and built shelters in multiple villages. 
The Daily Beast notes Brins philanthropy is similar to other attempted acts of benevolence from Silicon Valley billionaires (see: Musk, Elon and Gates, Bill) seeking to make a big impact. GSD even says its been involved with COVID-19 relief efforts, setting up drive-thru testing centers in California and provided supplies to eight US states. 
About half of the people working for GSD have military backgrounds. And not everyone is thrilled with the idea of a disaster rescue force made up of former military personnel, however well-meaning it may be: 
...[T]he use of ex-military personnel for humanitarian and conservation work is also controversial, according to Rosaleen Duffy, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Sheffield. They can arrive in complex situations with little understanding of the local context. They bring with them modes of thinking and acting, such as seeing certain groups of people as the enemy to battle against.
Whatever Brins motivation, this is a captivating story with great details about a billionaires mostly low-profile ventures into philanthropy, and his fascination with airships. Strongly recommend making time to check out the full story at The Daily Beast."

 But they still don’t have good tools to help people who aren’t severely ill In early March, most doctors in the United States had never seen a person sick with COVID-19. Four months later, nearly every emergency room and intensive care physician in the country is intimately familiar with the disease. In that time, they’ve learned a lot about how best to treat patients. But in some cases, they’re still taking the same approach they did in the spring. 
“There’s so much that’s different, and so much that’s the same,” says Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor at the Brown University Department of Emergency Medicine. 
“There’s so much that’s different, and so much that’s the same.”

For the first few months of the pandemic, recommendations for every incremental decision made in a hospital were changing faster than they ever have before. “You almost couldn’t keep up — from one day to the next, your practice would change and your protocols would change. It was really disorienting for doctors and nurses,” Ranney says. 
Information spread between colleagues, through medical education blogs and podcasts, and on social media. Doctors talked about new research on Twitter and shared new strategies in Facebook groups and on WhatsApp. If a suggestion that floated by a doctor in a Facebook group was low-risk and seemed like it might be helpful, it could be put into practice immediately. “If it’s a small change, they could start using it the next day,” she says. 
That’s how the now-common practice of asking patients with COVID-19 to flip onto their stomachs spread: through word-of-mouth and on social media. When someone is on their back, their organs squish their lungs and make it harder for their airways to fully expand. When someone is on their stomach, their lungs have more room to fill up with air. The advice started circulating through the medical community before there was a formal, published study on the practice. 
Testing it out wouldn’t have many downsides (it wasn’t dangerous to patients), and it was easy to do. “There’s this possibility that it could be positive, and there were a lot of stories about it having a positive effect,” Ranney says. “So, it spread in a much more organic and quick way, because it was something that we could do, but we weren’t worried it would hurt patients.”
Doctors like Seth Trueger, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University, saw the position help patients get enough oxygen to avoid needing a ventilator. “I started jokingly call it ‘tummy time,’” he says. Studies are starting to validate those observations, finding that patients who spent time on their stomachs were, in fact, better off.

Since March, physicians have also figured out other ways to help severely ill patients avoid ventilation. “We appreciate that it’s probably not a great thing for these patients, and we’ve developed other ways to get people high levels of oxygen,” says James Hudspeth, the COVID response inpatient floor lead at Boston Medical Center. For example, doctors are turning to nasal cannulas, which are noninvasive prongs that blow oxygen into the nose, before a ventilator. 
“We’ve developed other ways to get people high levels of oxygen.”

They have better medications for hospitalized patients now, too. Since March, doctors have cycled through a few different options — like hydroxychloroquine, which turned out not to be effective. Now, they’re primarily using remdesivir, and antiviral drug that appears to help COVID-19 patients recover more quickly, and the steroid dexamethasone, which helps improve the survival rate for patients on ventilators. “Many intensive care units and many hospitals have created their own standard order sets, or standard therapies, for people with COVID-19,” Ranney says. Those shift as new evidence comes out around different medications. 
That’s not unusual, Ranney says. Hospitals regularly change the drugs they use for conditions like flu and pneumonia as new data comes out. “What’s unusual is to change practice so quickly,” she says. “That’s just the reality of a global pandemic, with a disease we’ve never seen before.” 
Most of the changes in doctors’ strategies over the past few months have been in patients who are severely ill. If someone is sick enough to be hospitalized with COVID-19 but doesn’t need to be in intensive care, there still isn’t much doctors can do for them. They’ll get fluids to make sure they stay hydrated and are given oxygen if they need it. Doctors will try to keep their fever down and monitor them to see if they get sicker, but that’s about it. 
“It’s just those basic things,” Ranney says. Doctors now are more vigilant to the threat from blood clots, which have appeared in many COVID-19 patients over the past months. Because testing is more available in hospitals than it was earlier this year, they’ll also confirm that a moderately ill patient actually does have COVID-19 — and avoid giving them unnecessary treatments. But active interventions for patients with less severe symptoms are still around the same as they were back in March. “We’re still kind of in this watchful waiting,” she says.
Active interventions for patients with less severe symptoms are still around the same as they were back in March

One lingering question, Hudspeth says, is figuring out how to keep those moderately ill patients from becoming severely ill. Steroids may be helpful earlier on, he says, as could artificial antibody treatments that block the virus, though those strategies are still under investigation. “Part the challenge we face at the present moment is that the moderate patients are often where we would want to intervene,” he says. 
Changes to treatment strategies for patients who are not severely sick have been harder to come by — in part because it’s riskier to try something new in that group. If someone isn’t dangerously sick, there isn’t as much to gain from using an experimental treatment that may have a chance of causing harm, so doctors are less likely to take risks. “We’re more likely to try stuff with sicker patients,” Ranney says. “And their families are more likely to consent to a clinical trial.” 
Despite the open issues around COVID-19 treatments, the rate of new information is slowing down. Doctors aren’t shifting their practices as quickly as they were back in March and April, and Trueger says he thinks the next few months may be relatively stable. Doctors might get new information about which medications are more or less helpful, but other common best practices might be more entrenched. “I don’t think things are going to as rapid as the changes we had up front, when we were really flying half blind,” he says."

When humans cut their way through forests to dig up gold and other minerals that go into phones, computers, and other devices, they run the risk of being a catalyst for a phenomenon called spillover. Thats what happens when a virus makes the leap from one species to another. Its how two-thirds of new infectious diseases, like COVID-19, emerge. 
The novel coronavirus that has infected more than 10 million people, killing more than 500,000 worldwide to date, began as an animal virus. The virus got the opportunity to jump from one species to another, and it eventually landed in a human. Researchers first thought that the virus made the leap from animals in a marketplace in Wuhan, China. But there are plenty of other situations humans create that make it easier for novel viruses to reach us, including mining. The Verge dug into a smartphone and connected the dots between the minerals inside and the potential for another new virus to wreak havoc across the globe. 
We implicate ourselves in this chain of consumer supply and demand.
Our choices as consumers ... cause miners to go in there and come in contact with wild animals that carry viruses. We implicate ourselves in this chain of consumer supply and demand, says David Quammen, author of the book Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic. That is one of the broader causes of contact with wild animals that leads to spillover of new viruses with the potential of becoming epidemic and pandemic, says Quammen.
Take gold, for example, which is used in a lot of electronics because it conducts electricity pretty well. Marburg, a viral hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola, killed 128 people in Congo between 1998 and 2000. Scientists surmised that gold miners probably picked up the virus from animals, like bats, in mines, and the virus spread from there. Thats just one of several instances of spillover related to mining that The Verge came across as we were researching this video.
Its not just gold thats a concern, either. Like gold, a metallic ore called coltan (short for columbite-tantalite) is highly sought-after by electronics manufacturers. Its used to make tantalum capacitors that control the flow of electricity through a circuit board. Because both gold and coltan are valuable in small quantities, theyre also attractive to subsistence miners. Subsistence mining, also called artisanal or small-scale mining, is done informally often with little more than shovels, picks, and pans. 
A majority of coltan is mined at this small scale in Congo. And compared to big, industrial operations, small-scale mining comes with a lot more chances for viruses to spill over from animals to humans, experts say. For instance, subsistence miners working in remote areas might not have access to food markets, so theyre more likely to hunt for food that could make them sick. Our latest video explores the different ways a miner might contract a new virus and unintentionally trigger an outbreak.

Ultimately, the way humans interact with animals and the environment can have grave consequences for our own well-being. Thats why scientists and public health experts have developed a strategy for addressing the ways in which the health of the environment and all of the people and wildlife living in it are connected. Its an approach called one health. It brings together experts from different disciplines from conservation biology to medicine to keep people and the planet healthy. The idea has been around for decades, but the approach gained a lot of traction after outbreaks of another coronavirus, SARS-CoV (which was thought to have originated in bats), in 2003. 
Its one world, one health, because we all live in the same place, says Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio, an associate vice president for conservation and health at the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance. We are part of the animal kingdom. So we need to understand that thats the reason we share all these viruses with animals, he says.
We are part of the animal kingdom. So we need to understand that thats the reason we share all these viruses with animals.
There are ways to lessen the risk of virus spillover from mining and other extractive industries, according to Zambrana-Torrelio. It mostly entails having a more controlled environment when mining: performing environmental impact assessments, ensuring that there is safe food for miners to eat, and that there are rules against hunting for bushmeat while on the job. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has also developed recommendations for minimizing the risk of new diseases emerging in mining camps, which includes monitoring workers health and keeping an inventory of the local wildlife. But all of that is hard to do when it comes to informal, often illegal, subsistence mining.
EcoHealth Alliance, working in partnership with USAID since 2009, has found 1,200 new viruses including more than 140 coronaviruses. It only takes one of those to throw the world into another pandemic. Anywhere we destroy habitats by doing things like mining for minerals, were not just harming the environment were potentially setting ourselves up for another global crisis."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every facet of our lives, so it’s only natural that it would impact more than one of Apple’s product announcements at yesterday’s WWDC. Whether it’s the Apple Watch’s handwashing feature or the new face mask options for Memoji, the pandemic’s presence was repeatedly felt during Apple’s presentation. And let’s not forget, its entire prerecorded streaming format was driven by the pandemic in the first place.
In some cases, Apple’s announcements seemed to come in direct response to the pandemic, but others, like bicycle directions for Maps, were almost certainly in development prior to COVID-19. They just happen to be releasing at a time they’re needed most.
Apple has already made at least one change in response to the pandemic. Last month, with iOS 13.5, the company made it easier to unlock your Face ID-equipped phone if you’re wearing a mask. This is also the same iOS update that included support for Apple’s and Google’s contact-tracing API. 
Here are the biggest ways the COVID-19 pandemic was on display at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference:

 watchOS 7 can sense when you’re washing your hands and remind you to keep washing if you stop early.

 
The Apple Watch’s handwashing feature (obviously)
Let’s start with the obvious one: the Apple Watch is being updated to encourage you to wash your hands properly. We’ve seen similar features added to Samsung and Wear OS smartwatches, but Apple is claiming that its Watch is the first to automatically detect when you’re washing your hands. 
It does this by analyzing your hand motion using machine learning and listening to confirm the sound of running water. Then, it’ll display a countdown timer and alert you when you’ve washed your hands for the recommended amount of time. If you try to stop early, it’ll prompt you to carry on.

 Face coverings are just one of the new Memoji options.

 
Memoji face coverings
As COVID-19 spread around the world, face masks quickly emerged as a simple yet effective way of reducing transmission. Now, as countries are reckoning with how to allow businesses to open up post COVID-19, many are requiring people to wear face masks. They’re now required on many domestic flights in the US as well as in some theater chains. 
So it makes sense that Apple would add them as a Memoji customization option. During its WWDC presentation, the company showed off a Memoji wearing a green medical face mask, a color you can customize, according to the release notes for iOS 14.

 Cycling directions in Apple Maps give you information about how busy a route is.

 
Apple Maps cycling directions
Cycling directions aren’t something you build at the last minute, but they’ve been missing from Apple Maps for so long (Google Maps added them in 2010) that it’s still a wonderful coincidence they’d launch during the pandemic, just as interest in cycling is booming. Social distancing rules are difficult to maintain on public transport, so cycling is being promoted by cities as a healthier, more environmentally friendly alternative for getting around. The amount of time Apple spent on the feature during its presentation shows how important cycling has suddenly become.
With iOS 14, Apple Maps is getting updated with cycling directions for New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai, and Beijing. You’ll see elevation changes along your route, and the app can suggest times when you might be better off walking your bike up and down some stairs rather than cycling the long way round. A screenshot of the functionality shown by Apple shows that the app can give you a choice between faster and less busy routes.

 App Clips were advertised as a quicker way to rent shared e-scooters, among other things.

 
App Clips for micromobility sharing and more
Micromobility sharing services are another way to avoid public transport, and with iOS 14, Apple has introduced a feature that should make it easier to rent shared vehicles like e-scooters regardless of what brand you stumble upon. App Clips are a means of getting a small portion of an app onto your phone in seconds without having to go through the normal process of downloading it from the App Store. At WWDC, Apple specifically demoed it being used to unlock and rent an e-scooter.
App Clips are a big feature that Apple envisions being used for everything from paying for parking to ordering coffee in a shop without having to interact closely with other humans. It looks like a feature that Apple was going to introduce regardless of the pandemic, especially after Google’s Instant Apps for Android launched in 2017. But as companies like Starbucks turn to mobile ordering systems to help with social distancing and contactless payments, App Clips could help with many more aspects of our post-coronavirus lives.

 Messages is getting updated with better support for groups.

 
Messages and FaceTime improvements
It’s no secret that the pandemic has made messaging and video communications apps more important than ever, and we’ve already seen multiple companies introduce new features in response. WhatsApp and Google Duo have increased the maximum number of participants you can have in a call, Google has made its Meet videoconferencing service free for anyone with a Google account, and Zoom has become a household name. 
In a similar vein, Apple’s services are receiving a series of updates that should make them more effective communication tools, which will be especially helpful during the pandemic. Messages, for example, is getting better support for group chats in iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur. You’ll be able to respond to specific messages in a chat and call people out by name — two features that are critical for facilitating communications with large groups. iOS 14’s new picture-in-picture options will also make it easier to multitask while on FaceTime calls. While on a call, if you swipe up to go to your home screen, the call will minimize to a small picture-in-picture mode and continue playing, even when you open another app.

 Tim Cook took to the stage in an empty auditorium to begin yesterday’s presentation.

 
The presentation as a whole
Of course, the online-only format of the presentation was probably the single biggest way the pandemic was on display at WWDC. Rather than opting for an onstage demonstration in the style that the company has been using for decades, COVID-19 forced Apple to reinvent its approach, with individual presenters describing and demonstrating its software across various locations.
At the end of the presentation, Apple took a moment to detail its commitment to health and safety during filming. Face coverings were worn by everyone on set aside from the on-camera presenter, social distancing measures were observed, and Apple says that when multiple presenters were featured, they were isolated from one another.
It was a refreshing change for a company that’s used the same approach for its demonstrations for years, dating back to the time of its late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. To me, it felt like a change for the better. The whole presentation was slick and densely packed with information, even if a little atmosphere may have been lost due to the lack of a live audience. 
It was a refreshing change of pace, and I’d like to see at least parts of this style stick around even when it’s safe for Apple to do public presentations again."

 Just when you thought dating during quarantine couldn’t get any worse The texts came nearly every morning. I love you. I miss you. I adore you. If Grace* didn’t answer immediately, Scott, her boyfriend — or beloved, as he liked to call himself — would get worried. Was she okay? Why wasn’t she answering her phone?
It had only been a few months, but Grace knew she and Scott were going to spend the rest of their lives together. They’d met on OurTime, a dating site for people over the age of 50. She was retired, middle class, a widow with three kids who all now had families of their own. He was a successful businessman who worked in solar energy, drove a Mercedes, and had two houses — one in Cuba and another in the US. He was wealthy and promised he would take care of her. There was just one catch: he was stuck in Havana because of COVID-19 and couldn’t access his money. Could she help? 
Of course she could. Grace was in love. She trusted him. And wasn’t she ultimately using his money? So yes, she wrote some very large checks to pay for Scott’s business ventures, through a checking account he’d opened in her name. But the money in those accounts was money Scott had wired in; she was just helping him access it. 
“I followed like a freakin’ sheep”

Then Grace started getting calls from the bank. The wires were being reversed; they were fraudulent. Grace was on the hook for more than $100,000. By the time she caught on to what was happening, Scott had disappeared, as had all of his online profiles.
“I followed like a freakin’ sheep,” Grace tells me. “I just can’t convey how humiliated and embarrassed I am. I’m just distraught that I got myself into this.”
But how could she not? The vision that Scott laid out in lengthy emails and text messages was one of comfort and closeness. “I can’t stop thinking about you and the future we have promised each other,” he wrote on February 13th. “lt has been the most amazing few weeks of my life, getting to know someone as loving and caring as you. l am opening up to you more and more. l love how it is happening naturally. l think about you a lot and just want you to know that. i can’t hold back the feelings growing inside me everyday for you. l hope you know that and feel it constantly too. My heart belongs to you now always and forever.”
Later, he began laying the groundwork for the financial fraud, which involved a joint business venture in Cuba. He framed it as an act of generosity — as the wealthier person in the relationship, he was sharing his resources with her. “All the money that l will ever make from now on l plan to put it into our common account together and plan the future and everything else we do with that,” he wrote. “l am completely open about my financial background with you in every way. l am trusting you with everything l am as a man now and forever.”
Grace had fallen victim to a romance scam, a complex web of fake personas, fraudulent wire transfers, and fictitious business opportunities. While these types of rackets aren’t new, they’ve grown more sophisticated with the advent of online dating and social media. Fraudsters like “Scott” use a network of online accounts — LinkedIn, dating sites, a bank, even Zillow — to make themselves look trustworthy and successful. Then they sweep the victim off their feet, quietly get access to their finances, and vanish. By the time the victim realizes what’s going on, it’s nearly impossible to find the scammer. 
The problem has been exacerbated by COVID-19, which has provided the perfect cover for romance scammers. Prior to the pandemic, it might have seemed odd to start a relationship with someone without ever meeting in person. Now, for many older people who are single and also more susceptible to the virus, online romance is the only option. 
The result is that people like Grace, who are savvy, well educated, and technically competent, are falling prey. Over the course of months, they’re seduced by the sincerity and openness of their suitor. The oddities that might otherwise have tipped them off — like the person being stuck in another country — appear ordinary and reasonable during quarantine.
“These scams are crimes, but for some reason the victim gets blamed”

To Grace, the damage is emotional as well as financial. “I don’t have anyone to talk to; I don’t want to tell my family I’m an idiot,” she says. It’s a level of shame that is typical for romance scams victims, says Amy Nofziger, director of the Fraud Watch Network at the AARP. “These scams are crimes, but for some reason the victim gets blamed a lot,” she says. “It can happen to anyone. These people are smart, they’re educated. They just fell in love.”
Grace moved to Northern Illinois a year ago to be closer to her two sisters and her son. She’d been with her husband for nearly 20 years before he died from cancer in 2017. She wasn’t lonely, but she also wasn’t ready to give up on the idea of finding love. So she signed up for OurTime. In January 2020, she met a handsome businessman who said his name was Scott F. Parker. 
“He was very smooth, very persuasive, and very attentive,” Grace says. They started out talking on the app, then moved to texting and talking on the phone. Communication was nearly constant, and before long, they were in a committed relationship. “I was just surprised because all these great things were happening and we had never even met,” she says. “We were going to live this great life and travel. He had all this money and was going to take care of me. Every text started out ‘I love you and adore you so much.’”
Scott was open about nearly every detail of his biography. He told Grace his birthday (October 16th, 1965), his home in Illinois (a stately four-bedroom in Oak Park), and his favorite cologne (Creed Aventus). He had her speak to his mother, Christina, on the phone so the two could get to know each other. He discussed what type of health care they should buy and described his new business in Havana: a 10-acre property that he was turning into a resort. He said it would be part of their retirement. 
Her children, when she told them, were skeptical. They pointed out that she’d never actually met Scott in person. But Grace had no reason to worry. Scott was the one with money, and he spoke of little else but when he’d be able to come see her. 
Then, in April, he started pitching Grace on the idea of going into business together. The resort in Havana could be their resort in Havana, he said. The lockdowns were extending so he couldn’t come home, but he’d send the paperwork so she could get things started in his absence.
Scott set Grace up with an LLC, which he registered on incfile.com. Then he opened three checking accounts. He explained that he’d be wiring in money, and the bank wouldn’t insure anything over $250,000. When Grace logged into one account, she saw a wire transfer for $339,000. He asked her to pay some vendors he was working with. So she started writing checks. 
It’s more work than most people put into a real relationship

For two months, everything seemed fine. If Grace had been skeptical at first, the amount of time that passed put her at ease. Then in June, the wires started getting reversed. The bank said they were fraudulent. “It totally blindsided me,” Grace says. She had to come up with the money for the checks she’d already written, which totaled more than $100,000. “That’s the part that scares the crap out of me,” she says. She’s still waiting to hear from the banks on whether they will come to collect. She doesn’t know what she’ll do if they do — she can’t afford to lose that kind of money.
It isn’t unusual for romance scammers like Scott to spend months gaining their victims’ trust. It’s what makes these crimes so difficult to execute but so lucrative when they’re successful. “When you think you’re in love with someone, it’s one of the most powerful emotions out of there,” says John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications, and fraud at the National Consumers League. “We pretty consistently see people losing their life savings and maxing out credit cards.”
Since 2015, financial losses associated with romance scams have increased sixfold. In 2019, they became the costliest scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission, with a record $201 million lost. And while anyone can fall victim, Nofziger says scammers tend to target older people, who hold the majority of wealth in the United States. 
Oftentimes, scammers operate in groups, with one person playing the man or woman falling in love and others acting as business associates or family members. After meeting the victim on a dating site, Nextdoor, or even Words With Friends, they’ll quickly try to move off the platform where the conversation can’t get easily flagged. Grace isn’t sure how Scott’s scheme worked, but she suspects that the money she sent to vendors was actually going to him. His mother “Christina” was a character designed to make Grace feel at ease.
One difficulty with fraud carried out on a network of online platforms is that it’s hard to catch the scammer without cross-company collaboration. Dating sites, social media platforms, and banks are all used in the scheme, but without a method to track the person across websites, it’s nearly impossible to find out their real identities. “Nobody seems to take responsibility,” says Breyault. “There’s no way to stop the transaction.”
Even with that collaboration, it can still be difficult for the victim to understand they’ve been tricked. Scammers like Scott spend months gaining their mark’s trust and showering them with love and affection. It’s more work than most people put into a real relationship, which might be the first sign that the romance is too good to be true. Scott might not have loved Grace, but he certainly loved the thrill of the chase. 
For Grace, the facade started to crumble when Scott failed to wire the money to cover the transactions that had been reversed. He stayed committed to the scam, telling her the funds were coming; the banks were just being difficult. But she knew in her heart it was a lie. She sent him an email calling him out on being a scammer and saying he was a despicable human. “My life was just fine before I met you. I certainly had more self esteem before meeting you,” she wrote. “I trusted you and believed what you’ve told me, the promises you made and that we could have this wonderful fantasy life. Congratulations on pulling a dirty scam and doing everything you did to make me suffer when I’ve never done anything to harm you.”
“How can you say those things about me?” he responded. He said he was about to fly home. She never heard from him again.
Grace had been alone before she met him, but now she was left more isolated, without anyone to talk to about what she’d been through. It’s one thing to be abandoned by someone who said they loved you. It’s another to be ghosted by someone who never existed in the first place.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Qualcomm expects smartphone shipments to fall 30 percent in the comings months due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company said today, cutting its previous projections for the next quarter.
Thats in addition to the 21 percent reduction in demand for phones that the company noted in the past quarter, which it reported in an earnings release this afternoon. Qualcomm did still manage to beat its Q2 revenue expectations despite that drop in demand, with Q2 revenue of $5.2 billion (compared to the projected $5.02 billion), but net income was down dramatically, dropping 29 percent year-over-year to $468 million. 
Qualcomm says there are three coronavirus-related factors that could impact sales in the coming months:
<ul><li>How the COVID-19 virus, and government policies around the world to prevent its spread, will impact business and consumer confidence</li><li>Demand for new smartphones sold by customers or licensees that use Qualcomm products</li><li>The state of the global wireless supply chain, distribution networks, and workforces </li></ul>The company also also cites other, non-coronavirus-related factors that may impact its revenue in the company quarter, including its licensing dispute with Huawei, network rollouts, and its dependance on a small number of customers and licensees and the premium-tier device segment of the market. 
Despite the expected drop in demand for new devices, Qualcomm is still sticking to its original estimate for 5G devices shipped in 2020, with the company expecting to see 175 million and 225 million 5G phone shipments this year. The nascent 5G market is a big part of Qualcomms business, with the companys modems serving as some of the only viable options for device manufacturers to support the next-generation network to the point where Apple was forced to settle its ongoing disputes with the company in order to get access to those modems for its upcoming 5G iPhones."

General Motors is delaying the upcoming reveal of the new all-electric Hummer truck, which was originally scheduled for May 20th because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker isnt yet offering a replacement date for the launch of the new electric vehicle, but it says that the production schedule isnt currently affected. The new Hummer is due out in late 2021. 
GM announced back in January that it was resurrecting the Hummer as a 1,000-horsepower electric truck under its GMC brand, and it teased it in a Super Bowl ad starring LeBron James. The vehicle line, which became synonymous with the excess of enormous gas-guzzling SUVs, was retired in 2010 as the automakers recovered from the financial crisis. The new EV version will be built at GMs Detroit-Hamtramck factory, which the automaker is retrofitting to make electric and autonomous vehicles. 
The new Hummer EV is just one of a slew of electric vehicles that GM is working on as part of a more than $20 billion push into the space. The company detailed that plan at its first EV Day in March. 
Automakers around the world have delayed events and product launches, shut down factories, and even pivoted to making ventilators and other critical equipment as the novel coronavirus turned into a pandemic. The worlds biggest auto shows have also been canceled or postponed.

Nuro, the autonomous vehicle startup founded by two ex-Google engineers, is using its small fleet of road-legal delivery robots to transport medical supplies around two California stadiums that have been converted into treatment facilities for people stricken with COVID-19. 
The coronavirus pandemic has forced self-driving car companies in California to temporarily shutdown their operations and ground their fleets, thanks to shelter-in-place orders that ban nonessential transportation. But Nuro realized it could still play a role in delivering goods for health care workers by using its R2 prototype vehicles. These lightweight electric vehicles are built from the ground up to be completely driverless and, with slight alterations, could also provide contactless delivery, said Dave Ferguson, CEO of Nuro. 
Robots are not solving this crisis
Robots are not solving this crisis, Ferguson said in an interview with The Verge. But by providing truly contactless delivery of goods Nuro can help provide essential supplies to frontline health care workers who are fighting the virus. Thats actually very beneficial for both parties [by] drastically reducing all possibility of contagion, he said. 
Nuros robots are ferrying food, personal protective equipment (PPE), clean linens, and other supplies to workers at two facilities in California: the Event Center in San Mateo and the Sleep Train Arena, which is typically home to the Sacramento Kings. Both facilities have been converted into field hospitals to handle the overflow of patients who have contracted COVID-19. 
Human workers load and unload the vehicles at either end of the route. Typically, Nuros vehicles require the delivery recipient to input a code on a touchscreen to make the doors open. But to make it truly contactless, workers are only required to give a thumbs-up to the vehicles camera and a Nuro operator monitoring the live feed will open the doors remotely. 
One of Nuros vehicles will be operating inside the Sleep Train Arena, making deliveries to workers at either end of the facility. The transport that were doing reduces the amount of transport that otherwise would need to be done by the healthcare staff, Ferguson said. This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area.
This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area
The vehicles at both locations are on fixed, preplanned routes on private roads, which minimizes the chance theyll encounter anything too complicated. While they are capable of traveling up to 25 mph, the R2 vehicles will be limited to 5 mph outdoors and 2.5 mph indoors. 
This represents a significant shift to Nuros typical operations, which are focused on grocery and food delivery in Arizona and Texas. In addition to a small number of R2 vehicles, the company also conducts deliveries using its fleet of retrofitted Toyota Priuses with two safety drivers in each. But due to social distancing rules, the company is only using one safety driver per vehicle for its delivery routes in Arizona and Texas, and is mostly operating its vehicle manually. Testing in California has been temporarily halted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place rules.
The company also has the distinction of being the first autonomous vehicle operator to receive a federal exemption to mass-produce driverless vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or sideview mirrors. Nuro also was recently approved to test its driverless delivery robots on public roads in California becoming only the second company to receive such a permit.
The pandemic has made it an extremely precarious time for self-driving car companies, especially those that have been unable to secure enough funding to sustain their operations through an extended shutdown. But Ferguson said that Nuro has so far been able to avoid layoffs and furloughs by developing tools that allow its operations team to contribute remotely from their homes, as well as investing in simulation that allows it to continue running its vehicle tests in a virtual world. (The companys nearly $1 billion from SoftBank probably didnt hurt to have either.)
Were feeling pretty good about this this being within our control, Ferguson said, and its sort of up to us to execute and make it happen."

 Amazon tech workers are calling out sick today in protest of the company’s treatment of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The action, which will consist of a live streamed series of speakers in lieu of a physical rally, is a sign that the protests at Amazon’s warehouses have galvanized portions of the company’s white-collar workforce. 
The protest is in part a result of Amazon’s aggressive response to worker organizing. In recent weeks, Amazon has fired six workers who have called for better safety precautions during the pandemic, including two long-time user experience designers. Both were prominent members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and had publicly voiced support for improving warehouse conditions. The two tech workers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, were fired shortly after a colleague sent an email inviting employees to an online event featuring warehouse workers speaking about their experience. (That employee had already given his two-weeks’ notice but had his network access terminated, Costa says.) More than 1,500 employees RSVP’d to the event, but it was quickly deleted from their calendars along with the email. 
“I was so shocked, I was shaking,” says Costa, who spent 15 years at the company and was fired in a brief video call. Costa says the HR representative told her she had violated the company’s non-solicitation policy, possibly referring to an email about warehouse working conditions she and Cunningham forwarded to colleagues in late March. She believes she was fired for speaking out, and that the firings show how threatened Amazon is by the prospect of its tech workforce collaborating with the warehouse employees from whom they are typically isolated. “They are absolutely siloed, and intentionally so,” Costa says. “Obviously, we tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”
In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company supports “every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies.” The spokesperson said Amazon terminated Cunningham and Costa for “repeatedly violating internal policies” but did not specify which ones. Amazon did not comment on the deleted emails and calendar events. 
“We tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”


The panel went forward and approximately 400 employees attended, along with warehouse workers from Minnesota, California, Poland, and elsewhere. But the firings prompted employees to organize a second event, this one a protest. “It’s like a walkout, but in the time of COVID, because we can’t really walk out together,” Costa says of the sick out. Instead, they will have a series of speakers — warehouse workers, as well as the writers Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben — discussing the pandemic, the climate crisis, racism, and Amazon’s retaliation against workers. It will be live streamed over the course of the day. “You can come for 10 minutes or stay for the day, or stay home and watch Friends reruns. We don’t care, but we actually have proper programming,” Costa says. 
“If they’re keeping everyone safe what do they have to hide?” 

The second event has also met with resistance from Amazon. Tuesday night, an employee emailed an invitation that was quickly deleted. A software engineer in Seattle who asked to remain anonymous “given Amazon’s recent history of retaliation” checked his email after receiving the invitation, only to have it vanish ten minutes later. He had found the earlier panel “eye opening,” particularly the disparity in how tech workers and warehouse workers are being treated during the pandemic: while he and his colleagues were sent home immediately after a coronavirus case was confirmed at Amazon’s headquarters, warehouse workers aren’t being informed when coworkers test positive and social distancing is haphazardly enforced. 
“Now that Amazon is firing tech workers for trying to connect with logistics workers, and going so far as to delete calendar invites to events where tech workers can hear directly about conditions from warehouse workers, it makes you wonder, if they’re keeping everyone safe, what do they have to hide?” the engineer says. 
Amazon has been vocal about the safety measures it has instituted over the course of the pandemic. In previous statements, the company has touted the “extreme measures” it has taken to keep its workers safe, including mandatory social distancing, increased cleaning, and more than a hundred other policy and operational changes. 
“It’s very clearly retaliation.” 

But workers say the safety measures have been far from adequate. Their jobs still frequently take them in close proximity to each other, and people are continuing to fall ill. Yesterday, workers at JFK8, the Staten Island fulfillment center that was the site of the first walkout, received a notification that seven employees had been newly diagnosed with COVID-19, bringing the total count to at least 27, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Amazon has declined to say how many workers at how many facilities have fallen ill, so workers and activists have been left to compile statistics from alerts and news reports. The group United for Respect says at least 130 facilities have confirmed coronavirus cases, some with more than 30 workers diagnosed with the virus. 
Amazon has a history of responding aggressively to worker organizing. Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that the company uses a heat map to predict which Whole Foods locations are most likely to unionize. Yet the company has never needed workers more, as it races to hire tens of thousands of people to meet surging demand and replace workers who have chosen to stay home. The result has been a dissonant public response. After workers at JFK8 walked out, Amazon fired the organizer, dismissed the protesters’ claims — and then made many of the changes they had called for. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed executives planning to smear the organizer, Christian Smalls, and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.” Throughout, Amazon has publicly referred to its workers as “heroes.” 
The company has fired outspoken workers at warehouses in Minnesota and Pennsylvania as well. Amazon denies these firings are connected to the workers’ activism, pointing instead to policy violations. But employees say policies are being selectively enforced to target organizers. After workers walked out in Chicago, several of them were given write-ups for violating a 6-foot social distancing rule, even though the impossibility of maintaining social distancing in the warehouse was part of the reason they were protesting. (Employees at the facility filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, which is looking into the claims.) “All the reasons they’re giving for write-ups are issues that occur daily, but they’re only targeting people who participated in the action,” a worker there says. “It’s very clearly retaliation.” 
“Have backbone; disagree and commit.”

That worker is optimistic about the sick out. “I think that’s great organizing to connect tech and warehouse workers. We all have the same employer, just different workplaces and conditions,” he says. “They’re broadening the perspective on how to organize and how to collaborate with warehouse workers, and Amazon sees that and is attacking them for that.”
In the past, Amazon has been more tolerant of dissent among its tech workers, opting for warnings rather than terminations. That appears to have changed in recent weeks, with the firing of Costa and Cunningham. But it’s unclear whether this will be a sustainable strategy for Amazon. The company’s warehouse system is highly regimented in a way that makes workers easy to replace, all the more so in a bad economy. The job market for engineers is far more competitive; they have more leverage, and can leave more easily. 
“I’ve also seen many co-workers respond with outrage and dismay at the company’s retaliation against workers who’ve tried to sound the alarm on safety,” says the Seattle engineer. “Amazon claims to value dissent, but they’ve tried to silence workers to protect their own image — that goes against everything tech workers are taught about leadership.” (One of the company’s fourteen leadership principles is “Have backbone; disagree and commit.”) 
“It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”

“Tech workers aren’t used to being threatened by their employer, emails and calendar invites deleted when Amazon wants to silence someone, firing long-time senior employees to save face,” the engineer says. “It shocked a lot of people. It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”
Costa plans to continue her activism from the outside, both on climate and workers’ rights, which she sees as intertwined. Despite her firing, she still thinks like a long-time employee — talking about Amazon, she kept referring to the company with “we,” before catching herself, and she expresses chagrin at what she sees as a squandered opportunity in Amazon’s coronavirus response. 
“No company is benefiting more than Amazon right now, the stock is hitting an all-time high, and they could have also been the hero in people’s hearts, they could have set the bar high for how you treat essential workers in the time of COVID,” she says. “I really was trying to make Amazon a better company, for my kids, and for the company I worked for for 15 years.”"

Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge
Two weeks after beginning to survey users about disease symptoms in an effort to track the spread of COVID-19, Facebook said Monday that early results showed promise and that the effort will roll out internationally beginning Wednesday. Carnegie Mellon University, which conducts the survey, said that 150,000 people a day are now submitting symptom reports after clicking on a link in the News Feed. The university does not share any information about symptoms back to Facebook.
In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that initial findings shared by Carnegie Mellon correlate with public data about confirmed cases of COVID-19, an important signal that symptom surveys will soon be able to forecast the diseases spread. Facebook will use aggregated data from the university to produce interactive maps based on symptom surveys and will update them daily.
Ive always believed that helping people come together as a community will help us address our greatest challenges not just by sharing our experiences and supporting each other in crises but also by working together at scale to solve problems, Zuckerberg wrote. The world has faced pandemics before, but this time we have a new superpower: the ability to gather and share data for good. If we use it responsibly, Im optimistic that data can help the world respond to this health crisis and get us started on the road to recovery.
Facebook also announced a partnership with the University of Maryland to begin collecting symptom data globally. If Facebook users report symptoms in their own countries at rates similar to their participation in the United States, the data could prove to be an effective map of potential hotspots around the globe, said Ryan Tibshirani, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who is helping to lead the schools partnership with Facebook.
In an interview with The Verge, Zuckerberg said that global maps could serve as a reality check in places where elected officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of COVID-19 within their borders.
Some of these governments, frankly, are not excited about the world knowing how many actual cases there might be, or indicators of how its spreading in their countries, Zuckerberg said. So getting that data out there is very important.
As the pandemic has spread around the world, Zuckerberg has sought to demonstrate how Facebooks massive global reach can be used to help elected leaders and public health officials make more informed decisions about their pandemic response. Last month, Facebook began inserting a COVID-19 Information Center into the News Feed, showing users vetted information from public health authorities. More than 350 million people have used the center to date, Zuckerberg said.
The moves come as Facebook remains under scrutiny for its practices related to competition, data privacy, and allowing the spread of misinformation. The company is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of states attorney general over antitrust and privacy issues.
As the pandemic worsens, Facebook has worked to show how aggregated, anonymized data collected at global scale can be a force for good. Earlier this month the company also released mobility maps that use smartphone location to illustrate the degree to which Americans are complying with state stay-at-home orders. (Google has released a similar tool using its own location data.)
At the same time, the company has come under continued criticism for its role in spreading misinformation related to the coronavirus, and more recently for its use in organizing protests against stay-at-home orders. On some level, Facebooks corporate initiatives to reduce the harms generated by the pandemic are undermined by the behavior of its user base and at this point its unclear which of those will prove more consequential in the end. 
In a separate announcement on Monday, Facebook announced additional partnerships with researchers to use machine learning techniques to do additional forecasting. In New York, the company is working with New York University and Cornell University to create forecasts for the spread of the disease at the county level, as well as predictions for how a rise in cases will affect demand for services, ventilators, and personal protective equipment at area hospitals. One approach will use machine learning technology from Facebook to analyze de-identified X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) scans in an effort to predict patient outcomes and equipment demand.
Zuckerberg said that while Facebook would not seek to interpret the symptom data it shares with researchers, its size has enabled it to make a significant contribution to the public health response. 
What we can do is help them get a survey out to a large number of people quickly, and on a daily basis, he said.

 In January, early reports out of China started to hint that people infected with the coronavirus were contagious before they started to show symptoms. That’s unusual for a respiratory virus like this one, and it worried public health experts all over the world: it’s much harder to control the spread of a disease if someone who has it can pass it along before they know they’re sick.
It’s since become clear that, yes, it’s possible for people who don’t feel sick to infect other people. What scientists still don’t know, though, is how often it happens. And that matters for managing the pandemic: if only a few people spread COVID-19 when they’re symptom-free, missing them probably won’t have a big impact on the course of the pandemic. If most people do, though, it’s more important to track them all down. 
For months, there have been regular dust-ups over just how likely it is for people without symptoms to spread COVID-19. The latest quarrel stemmed from vague comments by a World Health Organization expert at a press conference. After the expert suggested that asymptomatic transmission was “very rare,” the organization eventually stated that they just don’t have enough information yet. Getting a clear answer will be hard. It takes careful, meticulous detective work to figure out how often people carry the virus without symptoms and how likely they are to pass it onto others when they feel healthy. 
It takes careful, meticulous detective work

That’s been done a handful of times in the past few months, says Mark Slifka, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University studying viral immunology. But it’s not enough, and we need far more data to settle the debate. 
No symptoms — yet
The confusion started in January when a report in The New England Journal of Medicine said that a German businessman had caught COVID-19 from a colleague visiting from Shanghai. The colleague, the report said, didn’t have any symptoms while she was in Germany. Some experts took that report as the first sign that someone without symptoms (the Shanghai woman) could pass the coronavirus on to someone else (her German colleague). 
It turned out, though, that she did have mild symptoms: she felt a bit feverish and tired, with minor aches, during those meetings. 
The first challenge researchers face around virus spread from people with no symptoms is reflected in the NEJM mistake: it’s hard to tell if someone truly does not have any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they just have very mild symptoms. Some signs of COVID-19 might be easy to brush off, and someone with a slight tickle in their throat might not think that they’re sick. If scientists are trying to find out if someone with a positive test is symptomatic or not, they often rely on that person to say how they feel. Those self-reported symptoms may not be accurate.
If someone truly does not have symptoms, the next step is checking to see if they ever end up developing them. Many studies of COVID-19 cases check in on people just once, when they initially test positive. If those people don’t feel sick, they can sometimes get classified as “asymptomatic.” Many of them, though, eventually end up developing symptoms later on, which scientists classify as “pre-symptomatic.” 
“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’”

“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’” Slifka says. 
In order to get good data on the number of people with the coronavirus who really, truly never feel sick, researchers have to track them for at least 14 days. (The latest people usually get sick after exposure to the virus.) Without that long-term information, the data is no good, said Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Saint Andrews, and other researchers in an open letter. 
Infectious or just infected
Once scientists have that long-term data, they can start checking to see how often asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people actually infect others. Studies show that people have high levels of the virus in their throats before they develop symptoms. People who never ended up developing symptoms also had copies of the virus floating around in their noses and throats, one study found, but at lower levels than people who eventually felt sick. 
Those studies show that people without symptoms could, theoretically, pass an infection onto someone else. They have copies of the virus in their nose and throat, and those virus copies could make their way over to another person through droplets of spit or the occasional sneeze. That doesn’t mean, though, that they actually will. The amount of virus in a person’s nose is still just an indirect way to measure how contagious they are, Slifka notes. “It doesn’t mean they’re a good spreader.” 
Someone who doesn’t feel sick probably isn’t coughing or sneezing, for example, says Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response. “One may argue that once symptoms start, and you’re coughing more, and you’re expelling more respiratory droplets, that that may increase your transmission,” he says. 
Information on the amount of virus floating around in people without symptoms and estimates on how many respiratory droplets they produce can be used to estimate how they could spread the virus. Those are just models, though, and they don’t directly answer the question. Finding out, conclusively, if anyone actually caught COVID-19 from someone without symptoms requires detailed tracking and even more testing. 
If a group of people is being tested regularly — like in a sports league, for example — it’s easier to re-create the order in which an infection passed from one person to another and when that happened, Karan says. “If this player became positive on this day, and then played in a game, and these other players became positive on days four and five, you can really trace it,” he says. 
Re-creating events within a household where everyone was only tested once is harder. If two members of a family test positive on the same day, and one has symptoms and the other does not, it’s impossible to know which direction the virus spread. 
researchers also have to exclude all other ways people could have possibly gotten sick

In order to say a person got sick because of someone else who tested positive but didn’t have symptoms, researchers also have to exclude all other ways they could have possibly gotten sick, noted Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida, on Twitter. That’s hard to do in places with high rates of infection. If the virus is circulating through a community, that person could have picked it up by touching a doorknob in a public place or at the supermarket, for example. 
A few research groups have managed to sort through all the clutter. One such study followed people who contracted the virus while working at a call center in South Korea. During the investigation, some workers had symptoms, some developed symptoms later, and some never developed symptoms. No one who came into contact with the workers when they did not have symptoms ended up catching the virus. Another detailed study that carefully traced the path of infection for 157 people with COVID-19 in Singapore found that only 10 were infected by someone who hadn’t yet developed symptoms. 
No good answers
That early data suggests that, even if they have the virus in their nose, people who don’t have symptoms yet or who never get symptoms spread the coronavirus less frequently than people with symptoms. The studies are small, though, and aren’t enough to say for sure who is or isn’t likely to spread COVID-19. 
They also don’t change what scientists know: some people do spread the coronavirus before they develop symptoms or without developing symptoms at all. Before there’s more evidence, that’s enough for public health experts to recommend that everyone wear masks, even if they feel fine, in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. “We have to play it as conservatively as possible,” Karan says. 
“We have to play it as conservatively as possible.”

The coronavirus is still very new, and scientists still have a lot to learn about it. 
“We’re still figuring this out, we don’t have complete certainty on the exact amount of spread from pre-symptomatic cases, or asymptomatic, or symptomatic,” Karan says. “That’s why, while we’re still learning about the proportion of transmission by these different groupings, that we wear masks in high risk situations very consistently.”
While we’re taking those steps, researchers should keep searching for better data, Slifka says. In areas with low rates of COVID-19, public health officials can do the detailed contact tracing necessary to figure out if someone caught the virus from someone without symptoms. The more testing states and cities do, the more likely they are to find the people who are walking around carrying the virus without any symptoms. 
“We should be monitoring each of the cases, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic and symptomatic, and checking for that secondary attack rate,” Slifka says. “Then we’ll have an answer.”"

 In May, we saw the arrival of the first viral hoax of the COVID-19 era: “Plandemic,” a meandering 26-minute video which falsely asserted that vaccines “weaken” people’s immune systems and that wearing a mask would “activate” the coronavirus. Despite the best efforts of Facebook and YouTube, a single upload of “Plandemic” got 7.1 million views before it was removed. 
As I wrote at the time, the problem was not that the platforms were ignoring the video — it was that, at their scale, even the few hours it took them to research the issue were enough for “Plandemic” to get all the way around the world. “It likely won’t be the last piece of harmful misinformation about COVID-19 that becomes a blockbuster,” I wrote back then. “And when the next one comes, I wouldn’t be surprised to see that the pathway to virality leads straight through Facebook groups.”
Indeed, on Monday we got the sequel. And Facebook groups played a significant role. 
The video that captured the public imagination this week lacks a name as catchy as “Plandemic” — it was a live stream of a press conference organized by a group known as the Tea Party Patriots, who are funded by wealthy Republicans — but it was seen much more widely, in much less time. Here’s Sam Shead at CNBC: 

The video was created by right-wing media outlet Breitbart. It depicts a group of people dressed in white lab coats — who call themselves “America’s Frontline Doctors” — staging a press conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Those in the video claim that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus. 

“This virus has a cure, it’s called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,” one of the women in the video claims. “You don’t need masks, there is a cure.” 


All of that is false, but falls squarely into the category of “something people desperately want to believe,” and so it found a wide audience. NBC News’ Brandy Zadrozny reported that in less than 24 hours, it racked up 20 million views on Facebook alone. 
“That Breitbart video from the doctors claiming that hydroxychloroquine cures the coronavirus has been going crazy in anti-vax, anti-mask, reopen Facebook Groups today,” she tweeted. “It’s at >20 mil views on FB. And that doesn’t include all the private groups it’s been spreading through.”
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter all began efforts to remove the video — although, as we have come to understand, this will be an ongoing effort, as people continue to make minor alterations to the video and re-upload it. (The platforms are still finding new uploads of “Plandemic,” more than two months later.) 
And it took Facebook longer than even the company thought it should have. Here’s what the company told me about it when I asked:
“We’ve removed this video for making false claims about cures and prevention methods for COVID-19. People who reacted to, commented on, or shared this video, will see messages directing them to authoritative information about the virus. It took us several hours to enforce against the video and we’re doing a review to understand why this took longer than it should have. Since April to June we removed more than 7 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram for violating our policy against sharing harmful COVID-19 misinformation.”

Compounding the challenge for the platforms is that the video was shared by two of their most high-profile users: the president and his son. Twitter put temporary limits on the account of Donald Trump Jr., and removed several retweets of the video that President Trump himself had shared on Twitter. Here are Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford in the Washington Post:

Twitter said it ordered the president’s son to delete the misleading tweet and said it would “limit some account functionality for 12 hours.” [...]

Twitter removed the videos, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared, and even adding a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use.


By now you may be wondering on whose expertise the president and the president’s son have staked their reputations on promoting a COVID-19 treatment that the Food and Drug Administration has said is “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19.” The group of doctors who appeared in the live stream is known as America’s Frontline Doctors, which made a website less than two weeks ago. Its breakout star is named Stella Immanuel, and I’ll let Will Sommer at the Daily Beast tell you about her: 

Immanuel, a pediatrician and a religious minister, has a history of making bizarre claims about medical topics and other issues. She has often claimed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. 

She alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are cooking up a vaccine to prevent people from being religious. And, despite appearing in Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress on Monday, she has said that the government is run in part not by humans but by “reptilians” and other aliens.


So on one hand, yes, this is a platform problem. Because the platforms are so large, and because viral distribution mechanisms are built into every post, dangerous misinformation can spread globally within hours. For reasons I still don’t quite understand, the Immanuel video racked up nearly three times the views that the most-shared “Plandemic” video did in half the time. And that’s despite the heightened attention every platform has been paying to misinformation related to COVID-19.
It’s also a democracy problem. When the president of the United States is sharing videos that encourage people to believe that a “cure” exists for a disease that has already — needlessly — killed 151,000 Americans, the issue extends well beyond tech companies’ content moderation policies and enforcement efforts. And he reiterated some of these claims in a press conference Tuesday, which was carried on cable news — and not subject to whatever rules Facebook or Twitter want to make about COVID-19 posts. Everything about this presidency is a crisis, and platforms have their role to play in mitigating its very worst excesses, and yet to think about this only as a problem of content moderation would be far too blinkered. 
Still, the speed at which Immanuel’s rant spread offers cause for concern. When I asked Facebook today why this video seemed to spread so quickly, no one could give me an answer. The company often points to the huge investment it has made in trust and safety, arguing that breaking it up would only worsen the spread of harmful content on the internet. But when Dr. Demon Sex can get 20 million views hawking dangerous advice in an afternoon, what exactly do we have to lose?

⭐ The United States is seeking to dismiss the charges it brought against two former Twitter employees and a Saudi national for allegedly helping the Saudi Arabian government spy on dissidents using Twitter. Given how politicized the Department of Justice has become under Bill Barr, it’s hard not to read this story and assume corruption is involved. An outrageous story, reported by Clare Roth and Peter Bloomberg:

Prosecutors in San Francisco on Tuesday asked for a judge’s permission to drop the charges. The two-page filing doesn’t offer a reason but specifies that the dismissal would be “without prejudice,” meaning the government could file new charges.

The two former Twitter employees, Ahmad Abouammo and Ali Alzabarah, were accused of feeding the Saudi government information about Twitter users critical of it. They were recruited by a Saudi named Ahmed Almutairi, who lives in the kingdom and has worked for the royal family’s social media company, according to prosecutors. All three were charged with acting as illegal foreign agents. Of the three, only Abouammo, a U.S. citizen, is in custody. He has pleaded not guilty.


⭐ Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are preparing for their “Big Tobacco moment” on Wednesday, says Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the FCC. He’s referring to the 1994 congressional hearing where seven executives from America’s largest tobacco companies said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive. On the other hand, that hearing was not about antitrust! Anyway, here’s Cecilia Kang, Jack Nicas and David McCabe at The New York Times:

The hearing, which caps a 13-month investigation by the House subcommittee, will be closely watched for clues that could advance other antitrust cases against the companies. The Federal Trade Commission, for one, is preparing to depose Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives in its 13-month probe of the social network. The Justice Department may soon unveil a case against Google. And an investigation into Apple by state attorneys general also appears to be advancing.

As a result, preparations for the hearing have been frenetic — even with the event postponed by a few days this week to accommodate the commemoration of Representative John Lewis — as tech lobbyists jockeyed behind the scenes to influence the types of questions that lawmakers might ask.


A Senate subcommittee held a hearing on the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act, which would reform Section 230 by making social networks by creating new mandatory disclosures for technology companies.

 Massive PPE shortages pushed DIY volunteers to get creative On March 20th, as the coronavirus situation in New York City hurtled toward full-blown crisis, Madiha Choksi was packing a taxi with two Flashforge 3D printers and as much filament as she could fit. 
Choksi, a librarian specializing in research and educational technology, had received an urgent email the night before from Pierre Elias, a cardiology fellow at NYP-Columbia University Medical Center. Elias desperately needed to produce more protective gear for hospital workers treating COVID-19 patients. He hoped Choksi, the administrator for Columbia University’s 3D printing lab, might be able to help. 
“The email was very long and really concerning,” Choksi tells The Verge. Normally, she could help. “But I don’t have any printers,” she remembers thinking, “and we were already on day three or four of remote work.”
“The email was very long and really concerning.”

Thankfully, Columbia handed over its printers. “Within hours, they were like, ‘Yeah, of course,’” she says. Choksi got to work in her apartment producing prototype face shields by modifying an open-source design, from a company called Budmen Industries, and 3D printing the plastic visor that holds the shield and rests on the forehead with a piece of foam-like material in between. She used supplies purchased from Staples to slap together about six units she then handed off to Elias a day after receiving the email from the doctor. 
“He took them straight to the hospital and tested them out,” she says, “and he came back and said, ‘Can we have 1,000 more?’”

The US continues to struggle to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, both at a state and federal level. So DIY efforts from academics, hobbyists, manufacturing experts, and professional firms have coalesced around COVID hotspots like New York City to meet the needs of health care workers and others on the front line of the response effort. 
Some of these initiatives are highly organized, involving partnerships across state lines to source materials and make use of industrial-grade manufacturing facilities. Yet almost all began in the living rooms of people with access to a 3D printer and the ingenuity to put together stopgap measures as existing supply lines struggled to keep up.
“In a perfect world, we have coordination across the nation, where we have hotspots and we focus the resources there so the health care workers are protected and patients are protected. And as that dies down, we ship what remains to the next location,” says James Hudspeth, an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University and a COVID response lead at Boston Medical Center.
“The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth.”

That ideal world is far from reality. Face shields, which Hudspeth says are rarely used in standard medical environments outside surgeries and very select procedures, ended up being second in demand only to face masks, which have also been in short supply. “One way people get infected is by touching surfaces and then touching the face or mask. The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth,” Hudspeth explains.
The problem is that shields are only made by a limited number of manufacturers, some domestic but many overseas. And large manufacturers only ship units in batches based on orders from procurement offices of large medical institutions and local and state governments. 
“We have a central supply, and some of the states have the supply. But there isn’t the capacity to dictate where privately produced or purchased stuff is going,” Hudspeth says. “States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.” That’s left doctors, nurses, and health care workers across the nation scrambling to get as much PPE as they can, regardless of where it comes from. 
“States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.”

A face shield of the DIY variety typically consists of a molded or printed plastic semi-circle visor, sometimes called a bracket, that is attached often by glue to a piece of foam that rests on the forehead. The unit then attaches to a long sheet of transparent plastic film that sits just above the face. 
Everything is held together with a rubber band or a similar elastic device. It’s a simple way to protect someone’s face when interacting with a potentially COVID-positive patient. These shields can be cheaply manufactured, easily sanitized, and then reused. They also aren’t as complicated or bound by regulatory restrictions as, say, respiratory face masks. 
The lack of regulations surrounding face shields have made them an attractive option for manufacturers large and small looking for a way to pitch in. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced in early April that his company would produce tens of millions of face shields for California health care workers, and Apple’s website now features a tutorial for assembling the units.

In the Pacific Northwest, Nike, which has its headquarters just outside Portland, has repurposed materials and manufacturing processes for its running shoes to produce face shields, too. Countless other companies, from Jeff Bezos-funded rocket outfit Blue Origin to Alphabet’s life sciences division Verily, are putting resources toward emergency face shield production. 
The efforts aren’t stopping at just shields but extending to face masks and even ventilators, too. Razer, the gaming accessory maker, even built its own automated face mask production line in Singapore, equipped with vending machines for dispensing them around the city-state. 
It doesn’t hurt that out of all the PPE in short supply during COVID-19, face shields are among the easiest to produce — a single unit can be constructed with basic materials by anyone with a 3D printer or even a laser or waterjet cutter. “The nice thing about shields is that they’re easy to produce relatively quickly,” Hudspeth says. “People who have larger 3D printers and a relatively basic piece of plastic that is flexible enough to bend can make a face shield.” 
Nearly two months after she’d received that first, frantic email, Choksi and her fellow Columbia University librarians Alex Gil and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira now run a DIY volunteer effort called COVID Maker Response. So far, the group has assembled more than 19,000 face shields and distributed units to over 50 institutions, including hospitals, clinics, fire departments, and other groups of first responders. 
The operation now has an almost factory-like scale and sophistication. They moved from Choksi’s apartment to the 92nd Street Y, a historic community center in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. They have two official manufacturing partners: 3D printing design firm Tangible Creative, out of Newark, New Jersey, and Brooklyn-based 3D printer creator MakerBot. 
Both firms supply the single 3D-printed visor to which the shield attaches. After receiving the parts in large batches, Choksi has a group of 10 to 12 volunteers, mostly medical students, on four-hour shifts assembling the shields and ferrying them by taxi or car to hospitals.

Gil and de Sá Pereira, both data librarians and scholars specializing in areas like data visualization and digital mapping, have experience in rapid crisis response through their academic careers. Now, Gil handles incoming face shield requests and spends all day in communication with hospitals. And de Sá Pereira is helping manage the operation’s resources and ensuring they’re using Columbia’s funding as efficiently as possible. The rest of their limited free time is spent helping other groups in the US and overseas start their own DIY operations. 
“When this whole thing hit, first and foremost in most of our minds was the lack of PPE, which was pretty harrowing in those early days,” says Jason Hill, an emergency room doctor at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “In particular, I had a pretty crazy overnight very early on where I had to intubate,” he says, referring to the insertion of a tube into the body, “in the middle of the night without one of the face shields. It was early on and nobody was expecting the onslaught to be that intense at the time, and we burned through our entire stash during the day.”
Uptown at the Harlem Hospital Center, Stephen Nicholas, a doctor who came out of retirement to help treat patients during COVID-19, watched as the PPE shortage was fast becoming a crisis of its own. 
“After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly.”

“I cannot tell you how horrible it was,” he says of the situation in late March. His hospital began using a special emergency code, “777 Gold,” over the loudspeaker when a COVID-19 patient had entered respiratory arrest and needed staff attention immediately. The “gold” was to tell hospital workers to wear appropriate PPE due to the heightened risk of infection, but the building was burning through its stash of face masks at an alarming rate. “There were periods every 20 minutes you would hear overhead, ‘777 Gold.’” 
Nicholas, a former professor at Columbia, heard about Choksi’s efforts through his daughter, a medical student at the school. Gil began helping the doctor coordinate face shield deliveries for his colleagues. “After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly,” Nicholas says. “Second batch was 200. I was out of those in a day and a half. Next was 500, and that lasted about two days.” He says the PPE shortage is no longer as much an issue now that most workers have their own shields they can sanitize and hold onto. 
Hill, the ER doctor, also found his way to Choksi’s group through word of mouth. He says, as the crisis accelerated, every doctor became acutely aware that acquiring more PPE as fast as possible would be crucial to keeping health care workers safe. COVID Maker Response is now helping supply his hospital with hundreds of these shields every week. 
“Every few days, I’ll gauge the needs for our particular ERs and ICUs with some colleges and we’ll swing by and get a box of 200 or so of these face shields to drop off,” he says. “When I walk through the ER, the vast majority of people I see are wearing these face shields. At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.” 
“At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.”

COVID Maker Response is far from the only operation like this. Choksi and Gil tell me they’ve been in contact with at least three others around New York City alone, and they continue to field messages from others around the country and even overseas that are interested in doing the same. 
Countless groups have also spun up elsewhere in the US, typically around schools and libraries with the space and resources to set up these makeshift factories. Some, like the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub and the Illinois PPE Network, have taken similar approaches to coordinating massive, factory-like volunteer efforts that employ individuals in their homes all the way to corporate partners and universities. 
“Part of our model is not to become the one supplier of face shields,” says Gil. “The idea of this grassroots, distributed model is to help others be able to do what you’re doing so many more distributed teams can aggregate to some kind of impact. This is of course in the absence of industry or city stepping in.”

One hurdle facing the PPE-producing projects is knowing when to shut them down, as more conventional manufacturing methods continue to ramp up. Choksi and Gil say they’re still receiving daily requests for more face shields, and shortages will continue so long as the novel coronavirus continues to overwhelm the US health care system and its hospital and other frontline workers. 
“I think we’re just going to keep going until the need dies down,” Choksi says. “There’s so many other efforts we’re hearing about, and until we stop receiving requests, our plan is to just keep at it. Full speed ahead until the needs are met.”
For Choksi and her partners at COVID Maker Response, the willingness for her volunteers and partners to keep helping has been one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise awful and often grim situation. She says the maker community and 3D printing in general have shown that they can fill gaps and help vulnerable communities in times of need, using their expertise and ingenuity.

 From left to right, the core volunteer group has consisted of Jess Ho, Rin Allen, Elisa Mala, Joe de Jonge, Madiha Zahrah Choksi, Rajat Sethi, Matt Car, Victoria Colozzi, and Cullen O Brown.

 


“I think the situation has really shown what 3D printing is capable of, which is not long-term mass production, but filling a need for very rapid production, on-demand and highly customized items,” says Dave Veisz, MakerBot’s vice president of engineering, who now works closely with COVID Maker Response on the volunteer effort. “[COVID-19] has just shown the vulnerability in the global supply chain. The fact that these parts are needed so badly has been eye-opening, as well as the fact that a lot of these parts only come from a handful of factories.”
Veisz says that under normal circumstances, you would just injection mold a face shield design and have a factory spin up to mass produce it. “But these things take months,” he says. “It’s been eye-opening to the general public that 3D printing can be used as a stopgap for emergency needs like this and can be used to kickoff production for the item.”
Choksi says the novel coronavirus has been the kind of situation the maker community prides itself on coming together to fight. “It’s very organized and mobilized and fast moving and constantly iterating. If there is an emergency, a need for crisis response, there is a file out there that is open source, readily available for everyone,” she says. “We’re just humbled and grateful to put our wits and expertise to it and just go.”"

If you're generally too sick to eat, drink, or use the toilet, those are also signs to seek call your doctor or seek medical help.
If you aren't experiencing severe symptoms that warrant an emergency, the CDC recommends you stay in touch with your doctor, and call before leaving home to get medical care. Many less serious health visits are being done via telemedicine or over the phone, and a call gives them time to plan for your arrival, or discuss your situation.
If you have underlying health conditions like asthma, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or a compromised immune, consider talking to a health professional before your symptoms get too bad (via phone or email). If you have a doctor who specializes in one of these conditions, it's good to work out a plan with them.

Not everyone needs to be tested for Covid-19.
If you are a healthcare worker who has symptoms, or are hospitalized with symptoms, the CDC considers testing a top priority. Older patients in long-term care facilities, those 65 or above, patients with underlying conditions, and first responders should ask about getting tested. As resources allow, the CDC recommends critical infrastructure workers, and those with mild symptoms in heavily affected communities be tested. If you don't have symptoms, there is no reason to get tested.
Looking for a test? Unfortunately, there's no nationally standardized place to go at this time. Instead, you'll have to consult your state or local health department to see when, where, and if tests are available to you. WhileAtHome.org has a good state-level directory of numbers and websites.

At the time, he was a top virologist at Canadas National Microbiology Lab, where he became a critical player in the development of the early Ebola vaccine ZMapp. Now hes the director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at the Université Laval in Quebec City, his hometown. His lab helped with the early development of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Zika vaccine in 2017.
Today, Kobinger is among hundreds of scientists worldwide working on potential Covid-19 vaccines; he is working with Inovio and Medicago, another drug company. WIRED talked with Kobinger by phone last week. The conversation has been condensed and edited.
WIRED: You've been watching and helping with epidemics your entire career. How does Covid-19 compare to, say, the Ebola epidemic?
GARY KOBINGER: Well, it's on a global scale of course, so its more widespread than Ebola. But its also important to remember that this virus has a less than 5 percent fatality rate, versus 80 percent for Ebola before vaccines. [There were 28,652 Ebola cases during the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa and 11,310 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are more than 775,000 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. It has killed more than 37,000 people.]
But pandemics are so similar in the way societies respond. I went to many different countries in Africa because of Ebola outbreaks. And often we were accused of being the ones bringing in the virus and infecting the population. We have the same thing today, where countries are saying its the Army or a secret Defense Department plan or whatever to export the virus.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
We also see the same delays. Theres this natural optimism of societies, where you think the virus isnt going to come here, and you end up facing exactly the same last-minute urgent needs for things like PPEs [personal protective equipment like masks and gowns]. China had problems with PPEs in mid-January. So you could argue that we should have planned for that. Instead we are scrambling as if we never saw it coming.
The difference this time is, because Covid-19 is affecting so many countries, you see a lot more sense of urgency to develop countermeasuresvaccines, treatments, better supportive care like ventilators. Compare that to being in the middle of the tropical forest in Africa, like we were with Ebola. We would have liked to have had all that fancy equipment. But people were not that interested in what we were doing. With Covid-19, Ive had all levels of the Canadian government coming to me, saying, Gary, if you need anything, please let us know. We are here to help. I've never had that kind of support in my career.
There are dozens of labs worldwide working on a Covid-19 vaccine, including yours. Is that a good thing, or should we be coordinating and focusing that effort more to maybe get a vaccine faster?
Its a good thing. Its actually important to test a lot of vaccines. We dont want to put all our eggs into one basket, only to have that one vaccine fall short in clinical trials. If we could have five vaccines that are safe and work and are potent, that would be much better. It also reduces the chances for manufacturing bottlenecks. With five vaccines, maybe we could manufacture enough for everybody on the planet. But with only one manufacturer, I dont think it will be possible.
But it needs to be done the right way. If you develop a vaccine thats not powerful enough to counter the virus, it can actually make the infection harder to treat. What you could see are people becoming more susceptible to acquiring the infection and maybe more susceptible to severe disease. That's something to really watch out for.
""Its actually important to test a lot of vaccines.""
Gary Kobinger, virus researcher
Whats clear is that the development is going to be expensive. If we had done this work ahead of time, we could have done it for $500 million to $800 million. Now we're spending billions of dollars because we're rushing, in an emergency. When the virus was first emerging in China, I said this has the potential to show our level of preparedness. We will probably realize we are not very ready for this kind of event.
Is there any way to speed the development, which is expected to take at least 18 months? Thats a long time.
Yes. With some government and regulatory coordination, we can be faster than 12 months rolling out a vaccinenot for the planet, but maybe for target populations like health care workers. You could also target vulnerable populations like the elderly or those with co-morbidities by doing risk analysis for each of those populations. The track we are on nowwith a vaccine that needs to work for everybody with no side effectsis slower. We'll see. With Ebola in West Africa, we saw things happenpeople working together, work that got donethat were unprecedented. I hope we are in another of those moments.
What about therapies? If we made Covid-19 less lethal, that could do almost as much as a vaccine and provide relief much faster.
You need bothdevelop therapies and vaccines. Therapies are important, but you have to be reasonable with your expectations. You have to be very careful about creating false hope with therapies. On one hand, if you dont have a randomized trial, its hard to make any claim about their effectiveness. At the same time, its important to listen to health care workers who are using those drugs on the front lines. They have a very good sense of what may be worth pursuing and not pursuing in trials, even if they are not using it in a randomized trial. So with drugs like chloroquine and azithromycin that are already approved, lets put them in the clinic as soon as possible, and at same time design the best clinical study you can.
""It will get worse before it gets better, but a lot of the control measures are working.""
Gary Kobinger, virus researcher
But the ultimate goal is to find a vaccine that keeps people from getting the virus at all. Sometimes patients who get it are left with lung damage that's not repairable. And even if the virus recedes, it could come back worse later. In 1918 the Spanish flu in the spring was a very mild wave, and then it came back with a vengeance in the fall."

Caesar Augustus considered three censuses, in 28 BCE, 8 BCE, and 14 CE amongst his lifes achievements. The last recorded a count of 4,937,000 people, a number etched upon stone throughout the empire. In the biblical account of Luke 2:1, Mary and Joseph were called to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, because Caesar Augustus issued a decree, that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
Unlike todays censuses, ancient censuses rarely counted everybody, often including only, for example, men of fighting age. So while they dominate the theological account, Mary and the infant Jesus would probably have been excluded from the administrative record. Indeed Augustus's empire was far more populous than his census counts suggest, home to perhaps 50 million people. Around the same time, the first truly reliable census of Han China recorded 59,594,978 people, a number remarkably consistent with modern estimates.
Ancient censuses differed from modern ones in another way: They were usually used to establish and maintain individual entitlements or obligations, of taxation or conscription. People did not like being counted: It was often in their interest not to be, and they might avoid it if they could. But when modern states established national censuses in the 18th and 19th century, those individual obligations were left behind. Under the influence of ""political arithmeticians and later statisticians, the census became a scientific, statistical instrument. In the United States, it became an instrument fundamental to the operation of representative government. 
Over the 19th century, ever more questions were added to the American census. Coupled with a growing population, old methods of counting could no longer keep up. Census taking had become a formidable engineering problem. In 1890, the census saw perhaps its greatest and most influential technological innovation: counting by electric machine. The Hollerith tabulator, named for its inventor, a New Yorker named Herman Hollerith, was about the size of a writing desk. A tall cabinet stacked at its rear gave it the overall shape of an upright piano. The cabinet displayed forty dials arrayed in four rows and ten columns. Each dial had one hundred subdivisions and two hands, like a clock, which together could count up to ten thousand.
The machine was operated by a seated clerk. At the clerks right, on the desks surface, lay a sturdy contraption with a smooth wooden handle, which Hollerith called the press. At the left was a stack of stiff cards, each one representing a person, with round holes punched out to represent different characteristics of that person: black or white, male or female, single or married, literate or not.
The operator placed each card, in turn, on the lower surface of the press and then pulled firmly down on the handle. As the jaws of the press came together, spring-loaded pins pushed down against the card. Some were blocked, while others passed through holes, making contact with cups of mercury below, closing electric circuits and advancing dials corresponding to the holes.
For Frederick H. Wines, a census employee who saw the machine in operation, this process of counting and sorting people by electricity approached a religious experience. Under the mysterious influence of the electric current running through the machine, they organise themselves, as though possessed of volition. . . . I can compare this current to nothing less intelligent and powerful than the voice of the archangel, which, it is said, will call the dead to life and summon every human soul to face his final doom."

Now, it sounds like a dystopian surveillance nightmare that could also save millions of lives and rescue the global economy. The paradoxical challenge: to build that vast tracking system without it becoming a full-on panopticon.
Since Covid-19 first appeared, governments and tech firms have proposedand in some cases already implementedsystems that use smartphone data to track where people go and with whom they interact. These so-called contact-tracing apps help public health officials get ahead of the spread of Covid-19, which may in turn allow an easing of social distancing requirements.
The downside is the inherent loss of privacy. If abused, raw location data could reveal sensitive information about everything from political dissent to journalists' sources to extramarital affairs. But as these systems roll out, teams of cryptographers have been racing to do the seemingly impossible: Enable contact-tracing systems without mass surveillance, building apps that notify potentially exposed users without handing over location data to the government. In some cases, they're trying to keep even an infected individual's test results private while still warning anyone who might have entered their physical orbit.
""This is possible,"" says Yun William Yu, a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto who has worked with one group developing a contact-tracing app for the Canadian government. ""You can develop an app that both serves contact-tracing and preserves privacy for users."" Richard Janda, a privacy-focused law professor at McGill University working on the same contact-tracing project, says they hope to ""flatten the curve on authoritarianism"" as well as infections. ""We're trying to ensure that the way this rolls out is with consent, with privacy protection, and that we don't regret after the virus has passedas we hope it doesthat we've all handed over information to public authorities that we shouldn't have given.""
WIRED spoke to researchers at three of the leading projects offering designs for privacy-preserving contact-tracing appsall of whom are also collaborating with each other to varying degrees. Here are some of their approaches to the problem.
The best way to protect geolocation data from abuse, argues Stanford computer scientist Cristina White, is not to collect it in the first place. So Covid-Watch, the project White leads, instead anonymously tracks contacts between individuals based on their phones' Bluetooth signals. It never needs to record location data, or even to tie those Bluetooth communications to someone's identity.
Covid-Watch uses Bluetooth as a kind of proximity detector. The app constantly pings out Bluetooth signals to nearby phones, looking for others that might be running the app within about two meters, or six and a half feet. If two phones spend 15 minutes in range of each other, the app considers them to have had a ""contact event."" They each generate a unique random number for that event, record the numbers, and transmit them to each other.
Got a coronavirus-related news tip? Send it to us at covidtips@wired.com.
If a Covid-Watch user later believes they're infected with Covid-19, they can ask their health care provider for a unique confirmation code. (Covid-Watch would distribute those confirmation codes only to caregivers, to prevent spammers or faulty self-diagnoses from flooding the system with false positives.) When that confirmation code is entered, the app would upload all the contact event numbers from that phone to a server. The server would then send out those contact event numbers to every phone in the system, where the app would check if any of the codes matched their own log of contact events from the last two weeks. If any of the numbers match, the app alerts the user that they made contact with an infected person, and displays instructions or a video about getting tested or self-quarantining.
""People's identities aren't tied to any contact events,"" says White. ""What the app uploads instead of any identifying information is just this random number that the two phones would be able to track down later but that nobody else would, because it's stored locally on their phones.""
Bluetooth tracing has limitations, though. Apple blocks its use for apps running in the background of iOS, a privacy safeguard intended to prevent exactly the sort of tracking that now seems so necessary. The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can also remain on some surfaces for extended periods of time, meaning infection can happen without phones having the opportunity to communicate. Which means GPS location tracking will likely play a role in contact-tracing apps, too, with all of the privacy risks that come with sharing a map of your movements.
One MIT project called Private Kit: Safe Paths, which says it's already in discussions with the WHO, is working on a way to exploit GPS while minimizing surveillance. MIT's app is rolling out in iterations, starting with a simple prototype that allows people to log their locations and share them with health care providers if they're diagnosed with Covid-19. The current version asks users to tell health care providers which sensitive locations they should redactlike homes or workplacesrather than being able to do it themselves. But the next iteration of the app will build in the ability to sort all the recorded locations of any users diagnosed as Covid-19 positive into ""tiles"" of a few square miles, and then cryptographically ""hash"" each piece of location and time data. That hashing process uses a one-way function to transform each location and timestamp in a user's history into a unique numbera process that's designed to be irreversible, so those hashes can't be used obtain the location and time information. And only those hashes, sorted by what ""tile"" of several-square-mile areas they fall into, would be stored on a server.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
To check if a healthy user has crossed paths with an infected one, a Safe Paths user will choose ""tiles"" on a map that they've traveled in. Their app then downloads all the hashes of the timestamped locations of infected users within those tiles. It then performs the same hashing function on all the timestamped locations in their own history, compares those hashes to the downloaded ones, and alerts them if it finds that a hash matches with one of the downloaded ones. That match means they were at the same place, at roughly the same time, as someone who's Covid-19 positive."

A dry cough, to be specific, and it wasnt just her. The 4-year-old Malayan tiger lives in an exhibit in the Bronx Zoo with her sister, Azul, who had also started coughing at the end of March. Altogether, seven of the zoos big cats appeared ill, two Amur tigers and three African lions in addition to Nadia and Azul. They neglected their meals. They wheezed. And they worried their keepers. Fears over the spread of the coronavirus had led the zoo to close its doors to the public starting in mid-March, but essential staff had stayed on to care for the animals. They wanted to find the source of Nadias malaise.
Nadia was not coming around and was getting a little worse, so we anesthetized her in order to treat her, Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle says. We did x-rays and ultrasounds. We did blood work. We ran lots of tests, panels for normal domestic cat infectious diseases. Although the Covid-19 pandemic had hit humans living in areas around the zoo hard, it wasnt initially assumed to be the likely culprit. After all, no animal in the United States had been known to catch the disease. It wasnt even clear a tiger could contract it. But with so many cases in the city, the team decided to test for SARS-Cov-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, just to be sure.
Within a few days, Nadia had tested positive, making headlines as the first animal in North America to do so. The news that a tiger in New York had caught the coronavirus was eye-catching. Who the hell did a tiger know to get tested so quickly?
While New York has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world, it also has a test shortage, and most people experiencing symptoms live in uncertainty. Sick people who do not require immediate hospitalization have been encouraged to stay home, assume theyre infected, and wait things out. This is a frustrating and scary experience. So the news that a tiger could somehow definitely and swiftly obtain a test provoked indignation, as the care and attention shown to one animal contrasted so sharply with the neglect so many New Yorkers have felt.
The veterinary diagnosticians involved are quick to point out that the tests for the tiger were developed specifically in their labs to use on animals, so Nadia was not given a test meant for a human. And while its an unexpected development, the tigers infection is relevant for scientists trying to understand Covid-19. Since the beginning, weve known that this is a disease that started off in animals and spilled over to people, says Casey Barton Behravesh, the director of the One Health office for the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. It'll be important for people working on human health and animal health issues to exchange information.
While the exact origins of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 are still unknown, it is believed to have originated in bats and then to have jumped to humans via a Chinese market specializing in fish and meat, including live animals. It is on its most basic level a disease that requires both animal and human health specialists to understand. Testing a tiger might sound like a bizarre detour, but it is intimately intertwined with efforts to learn about how Covid-19 impacts humans as well as animals. This is especially true because the Bronx Zoo's working theory is that a zookeeper may have accidentally infected Nadia. While a few dogs in Hong Kong, a cat in Hong Kong, and a cat in Belgium have reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 after human exposure, it is still not at all clear how easy or common it is for humans to give the infection back to the animal world, or what that might mean.
Because the tigers well-being is now enmeshed with a public health crisis, there are plans to conduct contact-tracing on Nadia. The New York City Health Department is actively investigating the tiger situation further, Barton Behravesh says.
The Health Department will investigate. Right now this appears to be human-to-cat transmission, however, how that transmission occurred is something we still need to learn, Department of Health press secretary Patrick Gallahue confirms. To do that, Gallahue adds, the department will interview the zoos staff to find out the level of contact between people and animals, and try to determine when those contacts occurred. Like so much about this pandemic, its an unprecedented investigation.
This is a disease nobody knows about. Nobody has spent their lives studying this. There aren't labs dedicated just to this disease. We need to all work together and collaborate across states, across countries, across specialties to be able to get the answers that everyone needs to be able to fight this virus effectively and efficiently, says Sam Sander, the wildlife veterinarian who tested Nadias sample at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. There's also opportunities for vaccine development, for additional testing, for getting more specific with how this virus replicates and when it mutates.

Nadia actually tested positive for Covid-19 three times.
After she was peacefully knocked out, the Bronx Zoo collected samples from her nasal cavity, the back of her throat, and her trachea. The samples were then sent in duplicate to Cornell University and the University of Illinois veterinary labs, where they were processed immediately.
We used a similar molecular test as the human test, says Leyi Wang, the veterinary virologist who created the test used on Nadias samples at the University of Illinois. (When asked if his test could work on samples from people as well as animals, he said it could in theory, but policy does not allow us to test humans.) So far, in addition to Nadia, Wangs lab has also tested a gorilla, a chimpanzee, a cat, a dog, and an armadillo. But we only had a positive from the tiger, he says."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Amazon is reopening its six distribution centers in France beginning today, according to a reporter from CNN. The company shut down the warehouses in April due to a labor dispute with workers who alleged that the internet retailer wasnt doing enough to protect them from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The six warehouses are set to gradually reopen starting today, according to an Amazon spokesperson speaking to CNN. 
Amazon closed all six of its French warehouses on April 15th after a French court issued a ruling that threatened to fine the company 1 million per item for shipping out anything other than medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. 
The court ruling came after a complaint from French unions representing Amazons workers who argued that the warehouses were too crowded and that Amazon wasnt doing enough to protect them from the virus. Amazon argued that its operations were complex and varied and that the the risk was too high to try to only ship products that met the court ruling hence the total shutdown for the past month. 
A statement posted by the CFDT Services union gives more details on the agreement, which includes health guarantees, a voluntary return to work for workers, adjusted schedules to help with distancing, and increased pay of 2 per hour through the end of May. 
Despite reopening in France, Amazon continues to struggle with safe work conditions for its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there have been seven known COVID-19 deaths of employees at Amazon warehouses. The company is also being frustratingly opaque about how many workers have actually been infected or died from the virus, with Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark calling statistics on infections not a particularly useful number. Amazon has also fired some of its employees who staged a walkout over safety concerns, which led to a senior engineer and vice president resigning from the company in protest."

President Trump has suggested that the coronavirus outbreak will be gone by April because the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus, as reported by USA Today. He has appointed Vice President Pence to take charge of the U.S. response to the disease.
But, will the coronavirus be responsive to seasonal changes similar to the flu?
In short, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the spread of the disease will abate with warmer weather. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) notes that at this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.
COVID-19 is different from the virus strains that cause the flu even though it can lead to similar symptoms of respiratory problems. 
So, to glean some insights, we need to look backwards to comparable outbreaks.
The SARS epidemic, which spread in 2002 across Asia, started in November and continued into July. The outbreak was contained comparatively quickly only 8,000 people worldwide were infected. 
MERS began in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, a country with relatively higher temperatures. We dont see too much evidence of seasonality in MERS, Stuart Weston, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told National Geographic.
The CDC says it is is simply too soon to know how COVID-19 will react when it first encounters warmer springtime temperatures."

Outbreaks in Italy, Spain and Germany led President Donald Trump to announce new restrictions on visitors from 26 European countries (except the UK), for the next month. The limits, which take effect on Friday at midnight, dont include US citizens, although they could be subject to enhanced airport screening. ""This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,"" Trump said during an Oval Office address Wednesday night.
Trumps decision was sparked by an alarming rise in European coronavirus cases. In Italy, the government on Wednesday reported 200 new deaths for a total of 827 fatalities. with 12,462 patients testing positive for Covid-19. Because of a shortage of both hospital beds and ventilation equipment, Italian health care workers are applying wartime triage protocols and making tough moral decisions about which patients will receive care and which ones will be allowed to die.
The United Kingdom had its biggest one-day rise in cases this week, with a total of 460 coronavirus cases, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Wednesday that two-thirds of her nation could be infected before the disease subsides. Given a virus for which there is no immunity and no immunization, we have to understand that many people will be infected, Merkel said at a news conference. The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected.
Plus: How can I avoid catching it? Is Covid-19 more deadly than the flu? Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer your questions.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic and urged countries to get serious about stopping its spread. We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday at a press conference.
It appears that Tedros message was aimed at the lackluster US response, which until this week has been slow to ramp up both testing and social distancing. Now, some public health experts say they are skeptical that Trumps European travel ban will contain the spread of the novel coronavirus here in the United States. Thats because the virus is already passing from person to person through whats called community spread, and many social distancing measures are just now being put in place, weeks after the virus was already detected in most US states.
The US has recorded 1,323 Covid-19 cases as of Thursday morning, with 38 confirmed deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center map, which tallies numbers from the CDC as well as local media reports.
I think we are focusing on the wrong things right now, says Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Center for Global Health Security at Johns Hopkins University and associate professor of epidemiology. We have 40 states reporting cases, and the majority are local transmission. Its not a bad idea to postpone travel because of the chaos and uncertainty of government response. But I dont think travel restrictions are our way out of this right now given that we have so much transmission in the United States.
Nuzzo says Trumps January 31 ban on travelers from China may have lulled public health officials (and the public) into a false sense of complacency. Thinking we could keep the virus out of the US through travel bans prevented us from taking the urgent steps to address the spread of the virus in our country, Nuzzo added. We haven't adequately protected the elderly and people with underlying health conditions, who we know are at greatest risk of severe illness and death."

On each doorway, orange placards with that Vulcan-looking biohazard symbol keep visitors alert. Through one window, you can just make out the heads of two people dressed in Tyvek suits and respirators. They seem to be laughing about something, but their work is deadly serious. 
The pair are growing the SARS CoV-2 virus in round plastic dishes. In February, the CDC sent the Army about 10 drops of blood from one of the first Covid-19 patients, a Washington state man in his fifties who was the epidemics first US death. Since then, the Army researchers isolated the virus and have been making more of it to ship to other labs designing a vaccine or treatment against coronavirus.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
If any science lab should be poised to tackle the current outbreak, its the US Army Institute of Infectious Diseases, or USAMRIID. This squat tan-colored facility sits in the middle of the sprawling grounds of Fort Detrick, Maryland, about an hour north of Washington, DC. Its scientists have been handling the worlds most dangerous organisms since the late 1960s.
From the Rift Valley fever that struck Egypt in the early 1970s to the Zika outbreak in 2018, USAMRIID researchers have devised dozens of treatments and countermeasures, most recently an Ebola vaccine approved by the FDA and licensed to Merck in 2019. Its also had its share of controversy. In 1989, USAMRIID was involved in a near-miss Ebola outbreak that spawned The Hot Zone book and TV miniseries, as the researchers responded to an outbreak of a strain of ebola at a monkey facility in Reston, Virginia, that killed several dozen monkeys. (Several workers were exposed and got sick, but the virus did not spread.) Decades later, in a separate incident, FBI officials alleged that researcher Bruce Ivins was behind the anthrax terror case in 2001. (He died by an apparent suicide in 2008 just before agents arrived to arrest him, and investigative reporting has since raised doubts about the FBIs conclusions.)
Today, the germ warriors of USAMRIID are hunkering down to fight the novel coronavirus. They are figuring out how it spreads, and learning how it infects different lab animals. This information is vital in order to accurately test new vaccines and therapeutics against the virus. One of their main tasks will be to develop an animal model which can be used to test possible treatments before they reach human clinical trials. Senior science adviser Louise Pitt directs the aerobiology lab at USAMRIID and has worked on Ebola, anthrax, ricin and the Marburg virus in her 30-year career here. Pitt says her team is gearing up for an expected rush of work in the coming weeks as more vaccines and drugs candidates that are being advanced by academic and commercial labs come online. (Their lab has several dozen cooperative agreements to test contenders that arise from separate agencies, labs, and universities.)
Pitts team is developing an animal model for any vaccine or treatment. Because this is the first time humans have encountered this particular coronavirus, theres no established way to test vaccines to make sure that the progress of the disease (and the possible cure) in an animal mirrors how it will progress in humans. Not all animals get sick from coronavirus, says Pitt. You have to find the animal species that has a disease that looks similar to humans. If you give the disease to an animal and it just sheds the virus and doesnt get sick, it wont help you.
Commercially-available laboratory mice dont possess the same ACE2 receptor that the virus uses to enter and destroy human cells. So any drug or vaccine tests will have to use a genetically-modified mouse, which isnt widely available, or find a different kind of animal. Pitt says her team is considering other rodents, such as hamsters and ferrets, as well as a nonhuman primate, the African green monkey, which was identified by USAMRIID scientists last year as an animal model for test vaccines for the MERS virus. Its going to take a year to build up enough animals and get the data to know that its really relevant, Pitt says.
By this summer, Pitt expects more than 100 military and civilian scientists and lab technicians to be involved in the coronavirus effort. Many will be doing the important but tedious work of developing tests that determine whether or not an animal shows an immune response, and whether the vaccine or treatment is working against the virus. We have to develop the chemical assays to measure everything, Pitt says. We have to test for the immune response, the host response, and the disease progression. Because its a new virus, all the tools have to be built from scratch."

Attached was an image with a missive from Grande asking young people to take Covid-19 seriously, even if they thought the disease wouldnt have an impact on them. Thinking that way, she said, put people who are older or not healthy in a lot of danger. You sound stupid and privileged and you need to care more about others, she wrote. Like now.
In a weekend that felt like chaos coated with uncertainty and dusted with misinformation, somehow, Ariana Grande surfaced as the voice of reason. The morning after some bars and restaurants closed to protect their patrons from Covid-19 while others stayed open as if nothing had changed, Grande told her 72 million followers to behave. It mightve been the most clear-eyed message to come out of the weekend. Recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project anywhere from 160 million to 214 million Americans could be infected with the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic. To help the US stay on the low end of that estimate people need to practice isolation, social distancing, hand washing. Or, as Grande said in a reply to her own tweet, your hip-hop yoga class can fucking wait, I promise.
Before we go any further, lets get this out of the way: Oftentimes, celebrities chiming in on the State of the World is eye-roll-worthy. Stars can drum up a lot of support for candidates and causes, but they can just as easily be a distraction, or make the politician or issue seem less serious. Yet, with the spread of the coronavirus, the calculus has shifted. Lots of peopletoo many, most likelyarent taking the virus seriously, or theyre just misinformed. Having a pop star grab them by the lapels and tell them to grow up might be the best way to elicit behavioral change among people who are prone to feeling invulnerable. or something better. Everyone wants to feel that Covid-19 is a threat they dont faceand that in turn is a huge threat to the elderly, immunocompromised, and otherwise susceptible people in their lives.

Fairly soon after her initial post, Grande followed up to encourage everyone to support H.R. 6201 (yes, she actually used the bill number), the coronavirus relief measure passed by the House that Trump got behind, because it will provide people with necessary financial support in terms of paid sick leave / unemployment due to coronavirus. Her thread eventually got thousands of retweets and was written up in BuzzFeed, Rolling Stone, and Vulture, among others. Fans familiar with Grandes statements in the past are likely not surprised to see her involved in the politics of the moment.

If anything, her statements about Covid-19 are just the latest move in line with what she told Elle in 2018. Not everyone is going to agree with you, but that doesnt mean Im just going to shut up and sing my songs, she told the magazine. Im also going to be a human being who cares about other human beings; to be an ally and use my privilege to help educate people.
Obviously, a lot of celebs have stepped up to encourage best practices when it comes to mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. Hell, before most of them went on hiatus, it was a steady topic of conversation on late-night talk shows. But at a time when the Red Cross is making TikToks to get people to wash their hands, humanity needs all the help it can get spreading the word about the severity of Covid-19. (Your move, Taylor Swift.) Tweets arent vaccines, but spreading information about the importance of social distancing is one of the best weapons available to combat the virus.

In the United States, where would-be lovers are still free to leave their homes, citizens are more focused on whether dating during a pandemic is medically advisable. Stories about concerned and confused daters are everywhere, and peoples reactions to the outbreak range from seeking a hookup for the end of the world (and saying so in their dating app profiles) to instantly unmatching with people once they find out that their prospective mate has been on a plane recently.
Even the dating apps themselves have been swept up into the Covid-19 discussion. Tinder will interrupt your swiping to remind you that, while they want you to continue to have fun, you should also remember to carry hand sanitizer and maintain social distance. Queer-focused app Lex has also been reminding people to wash their hands and suggesting ways to keep busy and connected while quarantined.

The caution is appropriate. A typical date breaks just about all of the World Health Organizations Covid-19 prevention rules. Theyre public, and most restaurant tables arent 6 feet across. Its likely youll touch hands, which is something people all over the world are trying to avoid. WHO officials have shared alternative greetings like waving, bumping elbows, and bowing. Then theres kissing. The French government has officially warned its citizens against kissing each other on the cheeks, and Spain has instructed worshippers not to kiss statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, so you know this is serious business.
Considering coronavirus is carried in saliva and sputum, kissing is just about the most efficient way to transmit the disease imaginable, short of spitting directly into your dates mouth. (We wont yuck your yums, but maybe dont do that until Covid-19 is under control.) You could date someone new and make that connection high intensity, but you should then break many of your other normal contacts, especially those that end up reaching the elderly and infirm, says Robert Glass, who has researched social disease transmission at Sandia National Laboratories, which investigates scientific solutions to national security threats.

Still, activity on dating apps is holding steady, and is actually expected to increase as more people quarantine themselves.

The apps obviously see this as a good thing: Some hope that their platforms will become a way for people to stay connected and meet new people without ever leaving their homes, especially if they (like Bumble) offer voice and video calls through the app. In some cases, preparations are also being made to field any questions users might have about Covid-19 safety and refer people to WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines."

Middle-aged and older men, and those with underlying health conditions that affect the immune system, are being especially badly hit by the virus. And while scientists cant say for certain why the current pandemic is discriminating by sex, it isnt a total surprise. 
This story originally appeared on WIRED UK.
The discrepancy was first seen in China. An analysis of 44,672 confirmed cases from late 2019, when the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan, up to February 11, found the death rate among men was 2.8 percent, compared to 1.7 percent among women. Italywhose death toll surpassed Chinas on March 19has followed a similar trend with a case fatality rate of 10.6 percent in men, compared with 6 percent in women, according to the country's national health institute.
Men were also disproportionately likely to die during the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which were caused by similar coronaviruses. More women than men suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003, but an analysis of all 1,755 cases showed that the death rate among men was 50 percent higher. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people, adult men were also more likely to die than women.
While scientists dont know whats causing the gender disparity in this current pandemic, smoking and drinking have been floated as possible theories. Historically, men smoke more than women, and the difference is particularly large in China, where nearly 50 percent of men but less than 3 percent of women smoke.
People who smoke are more likely to develop chronic lung and heart diseases, which are tied to worse outcomes if they contract Covid-19. One of the main reasons for death is that your lungs are no longer working, and if your lungs are already damaged because of smoking, theres less reserve before the lungs no longer are sufficiently effective at keeping you oxygenated, says Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.
A study of 1,099 patients in China with Covid-19, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020, found that smokers made up about 26 percent of those that ended up in intensive care or died of the disease. Smokers are also more likely to contract the novel Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus in the first place as they transmit it from hand to mouth when touching their lips and because they may share contaminated cigarettes.
In Italy, however, the sex differences among smokers are much smaller than in China, with 28 percent of men and 19 percent of women smoking. This may suggest that there is some other, as yet unidentified, factor at play.
Women mount stronger immune responses than menexcept during pregnancy to avoid attacking and rejecting the fetus growing inside themwhich could be another plausible explanation for the emerging picture of male susceptibility to the Covid-19 disease. In a series of experiments in 2016 and 2017, microbiologists from the University of Iowa infected male and female mice with the coronavirus that caused SARS, and as had happened in humans, male mice were more likely to die. But when the team removed the ovaries from females, their death rates shot up, suggesting that the hormone estrogen somehow protected them from the disease.
Hormones could also play a part in how the novel coronavirus, whose genetic makeup is around 79 percent similar to the SARS virus, interacts with human airways. Ian Hall, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Nottingham, explains that Sars-Cov-2 uses a spike protein to attach to a receptor protein called ACE2 on the surface of human respiratory cells. There could be differences in the way in which the virus interacts with its key receptor in the airways, which might make male individuals more susceptible, he says, noting that its just one theory. Research on the shape of this spike protein and all the ways it folds and shifts with the ACE2 receptor could not only shed light on how the virus infects men and women differently but may also offer a route to treatment."

Among the casualties: Adam Schlesinger, Fountains of Wayne founding member, lead vocalist and songwriter; Joe Diffie, Grammy-winning country-music singer; Alan Merrill, best known for writing Joan Jett's 1980s anthem, ""I Love Rock and Roll;"" Manu Dibango, a Cameroon saxophonist whose riffs on the hit 1972 dance tune, ""Soul Makossa,"" helped spearhead worldwide interest in African pop; and Aurlus Mabelle, the Congolese song-and-dance man dubbed king of the eclectic blend of black pop genres known as ""soukous."" 
Of all music genres, however, it is jazz that's been struck especially hard and deep by Covid-19. Four musicians of varied ages have died in the last few weeks from the disease, the most recent of which are Ellis Marsalis and Bucky Pizzarelli, two master instrumentalists who found widespread fame relatively late in their storied careers and also passed their legacies on to their children. 
Marsalis, who was 85, was a fixture in his native New Orleans as a pianist doggedly advancing the cause of bop and other post-1940s jazz music in a city more inclined to embrace the pre-swing era of the 1920s. Over time, Marsalis' commitment, chops and reputation as a music educator won him respect and affection from the musical cognoscenti of his hometown. 
Of Marsalis' many prominent students, including Terrence Blanchard and Harry Connick Jr., the most celebrated were four of his six sons. The achievements of Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis were considerable enough to transform the Marsalises into the unofficial royal family of jazz. Along with their dad, they also were staunch and at times acerbic defenders of jazz tradition which by the time Branford and Wynton became breakout stars in the early 1980s, also encompassed the kind of hard bop music their father continued to play into his 70s and 80s. 
Bucky Pizzarelli, who died at 94, was a buoyantly lyrical guitarist who spent most of his early career as a session musician working in recording studios and with such bands as Benny Goodman's and the Tonight Show's NBC Orchestra. He became a fixture in New York nightclubs, playing in several small ensembles with such musicians as saxophonists Zoot Sims and Bud Freeman and violinists Joe Venuti and Stephane Grappelli. 
Most noteworthy of these professional affiliations was the one he shared with his son John, whose performances with his father, beginning in 1980 when John was 20, were also a kind of apprenticeship, enabling eventual renown in his own right as a guitarist and singer. Indeed, John Pizzarelli's fame reached the point that his dad proudly and happily played a supporting role in his son's own high-profile gigs. 
What made the deaths of these two father figures in jazz especially poignant was that they continued to play, teach and inspire deep into their senior years with the possibility of having even more to contribute to the music through the growth of their students.
Pianist Mike Longo, whose coronavirus-related death at 83 came March 22, was, along with Marsalis, a pianist and educator of comparable gifts and influence. His glittering resumé, including providing backup to saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and singer Nancy Wilson (among others), is dominated by his longtime association with trumpet great Dizzy Gillespie, who tapped him to be his musical director and arranger in 1966 and continued to work with him, formally and informally, until Gillespie's death in 1992. 
Besides his work as a writer, arranger and teacher, Longo directed the New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble, which he founded in 1998. He continued to perform music until almost the end of his life. 
Wallace Roney's death this past week at 59, hit the global jazz family especially hard because it came as he was building upon an already formidable reputation as a trumpeter, bandleader and composer. Along with Marsalis' two elder sons, Branford and Wynton, Roney was considered a prominent member of the so-called ""young lions"" at or near their 20s in the 1980s who were out to retrieve acoustic jazz music's once prominent place in the American mainstream. 
With his smoky blue tone, slippery timing and cagey dynamics, Roney was perceived at the outset as little more than a Miles Davis clone. Indeed, the usually truculent Davis enthusiastically declared Roney his protégé. Those listening closer, however, would hear other influences, from Clark Terry to Freddie Hubbard, filtering through Roney's playing. Over decades, Roney's voice would achieve a gritty agility and pensive romanticism that belonged to him and him alone. His intelligent and at times startling negotiations between jazz's past and present implied a future of greater glories -- now shockingly, painfully made inaccessible by pandemic. 
No one knows how long this coronavirus siege will last, or who else we may lose. But one can hope that the spaces left open by these musicians' deaths will be occupied over time not only with fresh new voices, but with a wider, deeper appreciation of how jazz nurtures and nourishes many lives at once -- maybe even your own, if you let it."

As COVID-19 continues to change how many workers and students approach their daily labors, demand for some remote work friendly products is booming. As TechCrunch recently explored, some startups are seeing interest accelerate for their products, services and wares.
The trend has become sufficiently acute that it’s common now to see jokes on Twitter from people fervently hoping that Zoom doesn’t crash as many American universities quickly move to leverage the popular video chat service.
Zoom reported earnings earlier this month, beating investor expectations for the past quarter, and forecasting revenues ahead of investor guesses for the current quarter and its full fiscal year. The 2019 IPO also noted that it could see gross margin erosion as usage of its product free tier accelerated ahead of monetization. The remote work boom is changing Zoom’s short-term economics, and, investors hope, its long-term growth curve.
Slack, another recent public offering and remote work friendly tool, reported earnings yesterday. Instead of it going well, shares in the American chat app quickly fell. TechCrunch noted at the time that this was likely due, in part, to its further forecast appearing light. After the report dropped, Slack posted a temporary recovery, opening down a more modest 6% today after posting a 20% drop after its figures first dropped. However, since then its shares have slid and are down 19% as I write to you.
This morning we’ll examine the company’s notes from its earnings call, mixing in fresh usage notes from Monday.com — another popular remote friendly software service, albeit one that is still private —  and take a peek at new data that could help us illuminate growth trends in Slack’s battle with Microsoft’s competing Teams product.
The picture that emerges is somewhat complex, with Slack’s usage rising, but the firm hesitant to forecast present demand as future revenue as the world changes. But we can explain why the company’s shares fell and staged a recovery, albeit a temporary one. Let’s go."

In May, a viral video that falsely claimed masks make people sick and that the coronavirus was created in a lab racked up millions of views before Facebook removed it. The scenario repeated itself last month when another video, which falsely claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure” for COVID-19, got more than 20 million views in a single day before Facebook took action against it. In both cases, copies of the videos continued to spread across Facebook and Instagram well after the removals began. 
Last week, Facebook removed a post from Donald Trump after he claimed that children are “almost immune” from COVID-19. That video was also up for several hours and was viewed millions of times before it was removed."

Some of his ominous predictions are now playing out as the deadly coronavirus spreads around the globe. The virus causes a disease known as COVID-19, which has killed almost 2,900 people and infected more than 83,000 others globally since December.
""In the past week, COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been worried about,"" Gates wrote in a new op-ed for the New England Journal of Medicine. ""I hope it's not that bad, but we should should assume it will be until we know otherwise.""
Gates referred to the outbreak as a pandemic, even though the World Health Organization has not yet made that declaration. The group has said instead that the virus has ""pandemic potential.""
""In any crisis, leaders have two equally important responsibilities: solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again,"" Gates wrote. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. We need to save lives.""
In the op-ed, Gates suggested the following list of solutions that could help slow the virus' spread:
<ul><li>Wealthy countries should supply low- and middle-income countries in Africa and southern Asia with trained healthcare workers to monitor the virus' spread and deliver vaccines. </li><li>Establish an international database where countries can share information.</li><li>Develop a system that screens for compounds that have already been safety-tested to use in a potential vaccine.</li><li>Governments and donors should fund manufacturing facilities that can pump out vaccines within weeks. </li></ul>Gates compared COVID-19 to the 1957 flu pandemic, which killed more than 1 million people, and the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people. The current outbreak, he wrote, is somewhere in-between. 
Gates predicted that large-scale trials for a coronavirus vaccine could happen as early as June. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's infectious-disease center, recently said that he hopes to start testing vaccine candidates in people by mid-April.
Associated Press
However, drug development is typically a multiyear process that can cost roughly $1 billion in the US. Gates said making vaccines affordable for everyone is the ""right strategy"" for containing the coronavirus outbreak.
""Given the economic pain that an epidemic can impose — we're already seeing how COVID-19 can disrupt supply chains and stock markets, not to mention people's lives — it will be a bargain,"" he wrote.
On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to promise that a future coronavirus vaccine would be affordable for all Americans. But he backtracked day later, saying that any vaccine developed in conjunction with the US government would need to be financially accessible to the public. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already contributed $100 million toward the fight to contain the outbreak. In his op-ed, Gates said warding off a pandemic will require billions of dollars. 
""There is no time to waste,"" he wrote.
Although China has seen a drop-off in its rate of new cases in recent days, the coronavirus has spread to at least 55 other countries. At least 72 people have died outside of mainland China.

Public health officials cant just pick a date on a calendar. Instead, they need data: most crucially, data showing how many people have been infected, recovered, and are now immune to the virus. But those kinds of studies require blood tests for antibodies, which are still in development. It could take months before such information becomes available.
In the meantime, if the Trump administration is serious about sending people back to work, theyll have to first get serious about beefing up testing, screening, and monitoring, says Hanage. Building more capacity is essential for healthcare workers to be able to effectively identify infectious people and encourage them to self-isolate. Shortages in supplies needed to run those tests are still plaguing efforts to expand testing to everyone who needs it.
The US learned of its first coronavirus case the same day that South Korea did, back in January. By last week, that country of 51 million had already conducted over 300,000 tests; a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the US, according to a recent report by The New York Times. In contrast, the US, with a population of 330 million, has just this week surpassed 270,000 completed tests, up from 4,000 a week ago, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
By testing early and oftenat 600 new screening centers and 50 drive-through swabbing stationspublic health officials in South Korea were able to quickly map how the virus spread through the population. This epidemiological detective work allowed health workers to isolate people suspected of being contagious, without having to order the entire nations population to stay at home.
On Monday, Trump hinted that he wanted the US to move closer to that model; continuing to restrict peoples movement in coronavirus hot spots while loosening up policies and letting people go back to work in places that have low numbers of infections. We can do two things at one time, he said.
Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, offered more details on how that might happen in the coming weeks, as increased testing capacity starts to paint a fuller picture of the scope and timing of individual outbreaks in places like New York, the Bay Area, and Washington State. If we get data by specific zip codes and counties, well be able to approach this in a very laser-focused way, said Birx. What we will eventually get to as a country is being able to simultaneously do contact tracing and containment at the same time as mitigation. Right now were just putting everything into mitigation.
Throughout the briefing, Trump repeatedly interjected a line he had tweeted out over the weekend. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself, he said, referring to a rapidly deteriorating economy, triggered, the president believes, by the nations adoption of social distancing policies. Last week the stock market took its biggest-ever single day tumble. On Monday, researchers at Morgan Stanley said they expect the unemployment rate to quadruple by next quarter. The president is worried about how soaring unemployment numbers will play with Republican voters in his 2020 campaign for re-election, according to reports in Bloomberg and The Washington Post.
These fears appear to be part of the motivation for the presidents desire to reboot the economy, even in the face of a public health crisis that is deepening daily. Health officials inside the administration have mostly opposed the idea of sending people back to work, including Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci, who has contradicted Trump in recent days, openly advocating for tough and prolonged distancing measures, was notably absent from the podium Monday night. When asked where he was, Trump replied, Hes not here because we really werent discussing what hes best at, but hell be back up very soon."

Microsoft has launched a new interactive Bing map to provide information on the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The map shows the amount of cases on a per country basis, broken down by the number of currently active cases, recovered cases, and fatal cases. In the US, meanwhile, you can view information state-by-state. Selecting individual countries or states will provide links to relevant news stories and videos. Unfortunately, the stories being promoted arent always the most timely or useful to understand the current state of the evolving pandemic.
Microsoft says the tool is pulling data from a collection of sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and Wikipedia. The tool itself doesnt say how frequently its numbers are being updated, but at the time of publication we found the data to have been updated in the last hour.
In the UK, the tool surfaced an old video which claimed there were no cases in the country.
Image: Bing
Although the case numbers the tool is pulling are consistent with those published by the WHO, Microsofts COVID-19 tracker appears to be having trouble surfacing relevant news stories. When we tried to check news stories that were relevant to the outbreak in the UK, for example, one of the reports it surfaced was about a series of home improvement stores closing in France and Spain. Even more strangely, the lead video was an old news segment from January 24th with the title No confirmed cases of coronavirus yet in the United Kingdom, despite the tracker listing 1,391 cases in the country.
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the most recent article on the Dutch map (when viewed from The Netherlands) is two weeks old, despite the fact that the countrys government took the major decision to shut down public places including restaurants and schools just yesterday.
Microsoft isnt the only tech giant which is looking to provide information resources amidst the pandemic. Google has said it will launch a website late Monday with information about the outbreak, including how to prevent its spread and links to local resources. It is also providing information on the novel coronavirus on its homepage, and via YouTube and Maps. The company is also launching a limited coronavirus screening website, which is currently only available to people in the Bay Area of California, in contrast to the nationwide service that the US government suggested it was building on Friday."

Amazon Alexa users in the US can now use the voice assistant as a first step towards diagnosing cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Amazon has announced. Queries such as Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus? or Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19? will prompt the voice assistant to ask about your symptoms, travel history, and possible exposure to the virus. It will then offer advice based on official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information.
The functionality is a step up from the information Alexa was offering previously. Earlier this month, Vox reported that Alexa would list off simple facts. Amazons announcement follows a similar move from Apple, whose Siri voice assistant has also been updated to offer diagnosis advice.
Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?
As well as offering advice on symptoms, Alexa can now also be asked to sing a song for 20 seconds to help you know when youve properly washed your hands. Alexas subpar singing voice means we cant see people using the feature much for themselves, but it might motivate children. Amazon says the feature is available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, the UK, and the US. CNET reports that Google has also added a similar hand-washing timer to its voice assistant.
More generally, Amazon has also kept its fulfillment centers running, which has helped populations to follow shelter-at-home mandates. However, in some cases concerns have been raised about how its gone about this. Workers in the companys warehouses, which are still operating to fulfill orders, including the delivery of COVID-19 test kits in the UK, have reported that management hasnt been proactively informing them when colleagues have tested positive for the disease. Instead, theyve often been hearing about them through rumors. Amazon has also been criticized for not providing enough cleaning supplies in its warehouses, despite assuring workers that it has ramped up its cleaning procedures."

The ghost of Theranos is still haunting the biotech industry, even in the middle of a pandemic. A shell company called Labrador Diagnostics LLC, which says it holds the rights to two Theranos patents, sued a company making COVID-19 tests for patent infringement. The lawsuit asked the court to force the company, BioFire, to stop making its tests.

The shell company is owned by Fortress Investment Group, which bought the Theranos patents in 2018. Fortress Investment Group happens to be backed by SoftBank, which said this fall that it would spend billions to bail out WeWork before backpedaling on that deal this week. 
Soon after TechDirt reported on the lawsuit, though, Labrador Diagnostics LLC said that it would allow third parties to use its patented technology to develop COVID-19 tests though its unclear how valid its claims would have been. Labrador wants to make clear that the lawsuit was not directed to testing for COVID-19. The lawsuit focuses on activities over the past six years that are not in any way related to COVID-19 testing, the company wrote in a press release. 
This isnt the only unscrupulous legal action taken against people trying to fight back the novel coronavirus pandemic. Two Italian startup employees used their 3D printer to make valves for ventilators used to treat COVID-19 patients in a hard-hit Italian hospital, and the medical device company that normally sells the valves for $11,000 threatened to sue them. 
Over 200,000 people have been sickened with COVID-19 worldwide, and over 8,000 people have died. Italy has the highest number of confirmed infections outside of China, and the US has struggled to ramp up testing to meet the increasing demand.

Grocery delivery company Instacart says it will provide its full-service shoppers with health and safety kits days after some workers walked out over a lack of protection during the COVID-19 health crisis. The kits, which workers can request through an Instacart website starting next week, will contain a reusable cloth face mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. Face masks will also be provided to in-store shoppers at certain retail locations, according to the company. 
Providing protective equipment like face masks has been a key demand of Instacarts workers, who say it could prevent them from getting sick, or else becoming carriers of the virus. Shoppers previously threatened to walk out over the demands, although Instacart later claimed that it suffered no impact as a result of the strike. 
Gig Workers Collective wants more assurances on sick pay
The provisions come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to advise all Americans to start wearing face masks in public. Its a big shift from its previous guidance, which said that only sick people and medical workers should be using them. Now, however, there are concerns that people without symptoms may be carrying the virus, and that asking everyone to wear masks may help prevent infections.
Responding to the latest announcement, Gig Workers Collective called the safety kits a step in the right direction, but expressed concerns about how many kits are available, and how long it might take shoppers to receive them. In a blog post, the group noted that when hand sanitizer was offered on Instacarts internal online store for Shoppers it had immediately sold out. Instacart had previously promised to distribute independently-developed hand sanitizer to its workers.
Gig Workers Collective also expressed concerns that Instacarts measures still dont go far enough to protect vulnerable workers during the pandemic. In particular, it reiterated its demand for a hazard payment of $5 per order to cover the risks associated with working for the company, and for the default in-app tip amount to be set to at least 10 percent. 
It also demanded that workers with preexisting conditions who are more at risk from the virus be provided with sick pay if they have to stay home, and for sick leave to be made more accessible. Previously, Instacart has promised to offer up to 14 days paid sick leave for workers ill or quarantining as a result of COVID-19, but organizers said these measures didnt go far enough. Concerns were raised that a requirement to test positive for COVID-19 is of limited use when tests are in short supply and wouldnt help workers without health insurance.
Delivery services like Instacart have seen a huge spike in demand as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as people obey social distancing guidelines by sheltering at home. CNN reportsthat Instacart plans to hire an additional 300,000 independent contractors as a result of increased demand."

Our FC operations are complex and varied, and with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high. We remain perplexed by the courts decision, which was made in spite of the overwhelming evidence we provided about the safety measures we have implemented, and have launched an appeal. 
with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high
Amazon has come under fire both in the US and overseas for its handling of health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis has only made the e-commerce giants services more vital as people shelter at home and rely more on online ordering and delivery of household goods, food, and other items. But more than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the Financial Times, and the company is now building its own testing lab to try to keep its operations running amid panic surrounding the viruss rapid spread through its warehouses. 
Throughout the crisis, Amazon has been criticized by workers, activists, and politicians for not properly communicating to warehouse workers when a co-worker has been diagnosed with the illness and for not taking enough precautionary measures to prevent the illness from spreading by closing down facilities and deep cleaning them. In some cases, Amazon workers say they only hear about a COVID-19 diagnosis from co-workers, and in Kentucky, the governor ordered Amazon to keep its returns facility closed after numerous confirmed cases among the workforce. 
In one particularly high-profile controversy, Amazon also fired a warehouse worker in New York City who organized a protest against the companys handling of health and safety issues related to COVID-19. The situation, in which Amazon claimed the worker violated the companys self-isolation guidelines to attend the protest, drew the attention of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and accusations of retaliation. It was later discovered Amazon executives internally planned how to smear the organizer in the media. 
In France, the Union Syndicale Solidaires trade union filed complaints pushing for more oversight of Amazons handling of health issues during the pandemic and calling for the closure of facilities due to overcrowding. Amazon now says it is asking its fulfillment center workers to stay home. Amazon employs about 10,000 people in warehouses in France, according to Reuters.
In the mean-time, we are working through what this courts decision means for them and our French operation, the statement reads. While we will do our best to minimize the impact on French small businesses, those who depend on our FC network to deliver their products will be negatively impacted by this ruling.
Amazon says it will continue to serve French customers using its Marketplace sellers and robust global fulfillment network. However, its not clear if that means French customers will have to order from Marketplace sellers outside the country and have those products shipped in without routing through a warehouse, or if French Marketplace sellers will be able to ship the items directly or through an Amazon partner."

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has been much deadlier in older people but more anecdotes are popping up of young, healthy people getting critically ill and even dying of the disease.
What do these cases tell us about the disease?
Two 29-year-old health care workers became seriously ill in Wuhan only one survived, a report in The New York Times detailed. Other stories about people under 50 coming down with serious symptoms are making the rounds on social media, along with questions about whether seemingly healthy young people ought to be more concerned. What do these cases tell us about the disease?
A dear friend in Madrid is in a coma with Covid-19. Hes under 40 and was in excellent condition. So much for it only killing the old and infirm. Why are NYC bars and restaurants still open?
 James B. Stewart (@JamesStewartNYT) March 15, 2020
There are reasons for people in every age group to be cautious, health experts say, but not because our understanding of who is most vulnerable to the virus is changing. Just because older people are more likely to develop a severe case or die from the disease, it doesnt mean some young people wont. That smaller number of severe cases among young people still doesnt disprove the data that shows that seniors are the most vulnerable.
The US will likely see more young people get really sick over the next several weeks simply because the pandemic is still growing. Days can pass before someone starts feeling the symptoms of COVID-19. So experts anticipate a jump in the number of cases in the US as those who have been in incubation periods start feeling ill and more people get tested for the virus.
I think its almost a math problem in some ways, right? says Benjamin Singer, an assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Even with a lower likelihood of younger people getting critically ill, a certain percentage will get critically ill, and since the denominator is growing and growing these cases are popping up more and more.
Underlying health conditions can also make younger people susceptible to a severe case of the virus. Where you find severe cases or even death in young people, we dont really have full information on these patients, says Lee Riley, chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Its possible that some of those people might have had medical conditions that we just didnt know about. Chronic conditions that can affect young people, like diabetes, can make it more difficult for someone to recover from the disease.
We cant do this without the young people cooperating.
Even younger people who feel perfectly healthy need to take the pandemic seriously because they can spread the virus even if theyre not feeling any symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. Dont get the attitude, Well, Im young, Im invulnerable. Fauci said at a press briefing today. You dont want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We cant do this without the young people cooperating.

Electric scooters are vanishing from more cities as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to roil shared mobility services across the world. Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world, said it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries. Bird said it would halt operations in six US cities as well as all of its European markets. And Spin, which is owned by Ford, has had to pause service in very few cities and universities.
The decisions to suspend service reflect the rapidly changing environment in the US and around the world in response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Just three days ago, Lime was the only scooter company to halt operations in two US states and three European countries. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts
Now, with shelter-in-place orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home, scooter companies are likely seeing a steep drop in demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a challenge for the money-losing scooter business, that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts. The company said it was winding down or pausing service in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. 
The companys scooters remain available in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Brisbane, Australia; Busan, South Korea; Christchurch, New Zealand; Dunedin, New Zealand; Hamilton, New Zealand; Selwyn District, New Zealand; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia. 
Bird said it is pausing service in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Portland, Miami, and Coral Gables. The company has also pulled its scooters from all of its European markets, which includes Annecy, Antwerp, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Krakow, Lisbon, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, Paris, Rimini, Sevilla, Stockholm, Torino, Verona, and Vienna.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale. Given our deep understanding of and empathy towards the cities, communities and people we serve, we are temporarily pausing our service in a variety of cities, a spokesperson said. This is very fluid as the response to COVID-19 evolves and is in line with voluntary, as well as mandatory measures set by local governments for businesses.
In contrast, Spin says it has been asked to step up by some cities to help fill transportation gaps after the public bus system was shut down. The Ford-owned company says it was designated as an essential service during the citys shelter-in-place order and encouraged to continue operations as a healthy mobility option. Still, Spin said it has also paused operations in very few markets, either because a city requested it or because a university campus has been shut down. (A spokesperson didnt specify which cities it had paused service.)
For the remaining scooters still available to rent, all of the companies say they have stepped up their sanitizing efforts and instituted new workplace protocols for employees to ensure social distancing in the warehouses that are still opened. 
Lyft is still offering scooters to rent in San Francisco, but it halted operations in Miami at the request of the city. Jump, which is owned by Uber, didnt respond to requests for comment. According to Streetsblog, Jump has only paused scooter operations in Sacramento, California. Last month, Lyft said in a regulatory filing that the outbreak in China has led to production delays of certain automotive parts and components of bikes and scooters.
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic. Public transportation ridership has cratered and fare revenue has practically dried up. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also seeing precipitous drops in gross bookings in cities hit hard by the disease. Three weeks of social distancing and warnings to stay at home have taken a huge bite out of the total number of trips taken with all modes of transportation. 
But as people avoid transit and shared modes of travel, the silver lining seems to be the number of personal mobility trips that are rising. In New York City, for instance, cycling traffic on the East River bridges is up over 50 percent and Citi Bike ridership is up almost 70 percent compared to this time last year. But city officials arent doing enough to protect those riders who are switching to bikes; cyclist injuries were up 43 percent between March 9th and March 15th, according to NYPD statistics obtained by Streetsblog. 
Cities have a unique opportunity during the pandemic to remake their streets to better prioritize these low-carbon forms of transportation. While staying at home and following government recommendations for social distancing is the first order of priorities, if you have to take a trip and do not want to ride public transport, or if public transport has reduced service, the bicycle can be a good alternative, Virginia Tech transportation expert Ralph Buehler said in an email."

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs philanthropic arm, has committed $25 million to a research fund designed to help identify and develop treatments for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, it announced today.
CZI, managed by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, is donating to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which will help coordinate research efforts to identify new drugs and treatments for the illness. The Accelerator is already backed by $125 million in commitments from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, health foundation Wellcome, and Mastercards Impact Fund, according a March 10th press release.
The Gates Foundation has committed up to $50 million
CZI says it will provide $20 million to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator and make another $5 million available based on future needs. The Gates Foundation and Wellcome each have committed up to $50 million, while Mastercards Impact Fund has committed up to $25 million. 
The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, organizations in both the public and private sectors, and global regulatory and policy-setting institutions to coordinate research efforts, according to the release.
Were excited to partner with the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard to help the biomedical research community quickly identify, develop, and test treatments for COVID-19, said Chan and Zuckerberg in a statement. The Therapeutics Accelerator will enable researchers to quickly determine whether or not existing drugs have a potential benefit against COVID-19. We hope these coordinated efforts will help stop the spread of COVID-19 as well as provide shared, reusable strategies to respond to future pandemics.
CZI and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which researches ways to cure and manage diseases, have already been working to help increase the number of COVID-19 tests in the San Francisco Bay Area. CZI said last week it is aiming to help the University of California, San Francisco support at least 1,000 tests per day in the coming days.
The Gates Foundation is also working to increase testing, partnering with the University of Washington to offer at-home COVID-19 testing kits for people in the Seattle area. However, its not clear when that program will begin. The Gates Foundations commitment to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator comes in part from its up to $100 million commitment to COVID-19 response announced on February 5th.

Fact-checking organization Snopes has been forced to scale back its routine content production and special projects, as the amount of misinformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed its fact-checkers. 
In a blog post that was later published as a series of tweets, the organization said the pandemic is overwhelming its small team and that it cant ask them to ramp up productivity at a time when everyones personal lives are being placed under such strain. Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive, the organization wrote, but exhausting our staff in this crisis is not the cure for what is ailing our industry. Going forward, it said it intends to focus its efforts only where we think we can have a significant impact.
Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive
Snopes isnt the only organization struggling to handle the amount of misinformation thats being spread about the novel coronavirus pandemic. Facebook, which until last year had partnered with Snopes to combat misinformation, pledged to remove coronavirus misinformation, only for a software bug to start marking legitimate news articles as spam. Twitter, meanwhile, has been inconsistent in its approach. It removed misinformation posted by several high-profile accounts but later refused to remove a misleading tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
In its announcement, Snopes offered some advice on how people could help to combat the spread of misinformation. It directed people toward official information sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) and asked people to support local news publications and businesses. It also called for people to support Snopes directly with donations and to lobby big tech platforms to do more to combat misinformation themselves.
As well as scaling back production on its regular content, Snopes says that its offering all of its employees a $750 cash bonus to help with any costs they may be facing, and it has said it will offer paid time off for people as they look after themselves and their families.
In the meantime, if youd like to check out the COVID-19 fact-checking Snopes has already done, you can do so here."

The last two decades have ushered in significant change and transformation. I believe the 2020s will be dispositive in redefining the pillars of our economy, and COVID-19 magnifies this greatly. As of this writing there are 3,611,394 confirmed cases, and the U.S. accounts for 33% of those. We are now dealing with a 4.8% Q1 GDP contraction and expectations for Q2s shrinking runs into the 25% range, more than 30 million unemployed and a $7 trillion federal intervention in a span of six weeks.
Eric Schmidt recently predicted that the coronavirus pandemic is strengthening big tech. It is hard to disagree with him; it almost feels obvious. Big tech and other digital companies are net beneficiaries of new habits and behaviors. Some of this shift will be permanent, and well-capitalized tech companies are likely to expand their power by grabbing talent and buying companies for their IP — then dissolving them.
With power comes political backlash and public wariness. One flavor of that counter pressure is already in full effect. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have proposed new legislation that seeks to curtail acquisition activity via the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act. Ill reserve judgment on their effort, but the theme is familiar: the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, which further widens gaps and calcifies disparity.
The COVID-19 shock is highlighting a chasm that has evolved over decades. The digital divide, lack of capital access, sporadic paths to education and microscopic levels of wealth accumulation in communities of color and the implicit/explicit bias against non-coastal elites are some contributing factors.
During the 2008 crisis, the combined value of the five biggest companies ExxonMobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&amp;T and Procter &amp; Gamble was $1.6 trillion. Microsoft is worth almost that today — all by itself. No need to talk about FAANG, because since the pandemics economic halt, Peloton downloads went up five-fold in a month, Zoom grew to 200 million users from 10 million in December and Instacart users grew six times in that period.
Roelof Botha of Sequoia Capital was recently quoted as saying, Like the killing off of the dinosaurs, this reorders who gets to survive in the new era. It is the shock that accelerates the future that Silicon Valley has been building. It is hard to argue with his views.
To be clear, I am a beneficiary of and a big believer in technology. Throughout my career I have managed it, invested in it and made policy on it. For example, one of the multi-billion-dollar programs I oversaw, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, has invested more than $50 billion in tens of thousands of startups, which have collectively issued 70,000 patents and raised hundreds of billions of capital — and 700 of them have gone public, including tech titans such as Qualcomm, Biogen and Symantec.
My point: I think about technology a lot, and, lately, about its repercussions. There is a massive shift afoot where more power and influence will be consolidated by these remarkable companies and their technology. Besides the economic consequences of the strong crushing the weak, there are serious ethical issues to consider as a society. Chamath Palihapitiya has been pretty vocal about the moral hazard of what is essentially a massive transfer of wealth and income. On one side you have mismanaged and/or myopic corporations and on the other, the counterparty is the American people and the money we need to print to bankroll the lifeline. I am not talking about Main Street here, by the way.
It is not hard to imagine a world in which tech alone reigns supreme. The ethical dilemmas of this are vast. A recent documentary, Do You Trust this Computer, put a spotlight on a frantic Elon Musk ringing the alarm bell on machines potential to destroy humanity. Stephen Hawking argued that while artificial intelligence could provide society with outsized benefits, it also has the potential to spiral out of control and end the human race. Bill Gates has been less fatalistic, but is also in the camp of those concerned with synthetic intelligence. In an interesting parallel, Bill has for years been very vocal on the risks pandemics pose and our lack of preparedness for them — indeed.
These three men have had a big impact on the world with and because of technology. Their deep concern is rooted in the fact that once the genie is out of the bottle, it will make and grant wishes to itself without regard to humanity. But, is this doomsday thinking? I dont know. What I do know is that I am not alone thinking about this. With COVID-19 as a backdrop, many people are.
Algorithmic sophistication and computer horsepower continue to evolve by leaps and bounds, and serious capital continues to be invested on these fronts. The number of transistors per chip has increased from thousands in the 1950s to over four billion today. A one-atom transistor is the physical boundary of Moores Law. Increasing the amount of information conveyed per unit, say with quantum computing, is the most realistic possibility of extending Moores Law, and with it the march toward intelligent machines and a tech first world. The march has been accelerated, even if peripherally, by the pandemic.
While the promise of technology-driven progress is massive, there are some serious societal costs to exponential discovery and unleashed capability acceleration. Dartmouths Dr. James Moor, a notable thinker at the intersection of ethics and technology, believes that the use and development of technologies are most important when technologies have transformative effects on societies. He stipulates that as the impact of technology grows, the volume and complexity of ethical issues surrounding it increases. This is not only because more people are touched by these innovations, they are. It is because transformative technology increases pathways of action that outstrip governance systems and ethical constructs to tame it.
So what? The twists and turns of technology application lead to consequences, sometimes unknowable and for that reason we should be increasingly vigilant. Did Zuckerberg ever imagine that his invention would have been so central to the outcome of the 2016 election? Unknowable consequences, exhibit one. Interconnected systems touch every aspect of society, from digital terrorism to bioengineering to brain hacking and neural cryonics to swarm warfare, digital assets, intelligent weapons, trillions of IoT connected devices — the list goes on.
As a society, we should be open to innovation and the benefits it ushers in. At the same time, we must also remain committed to sustainable tech development and a deployment mechanism that does not fail to shine a light on human dignity, economic inequality and broad inclusiveness. These seem like esoteric issues, but they are not, and they are being put to the test by COVID-19.
A fresh example of this thematic happened recently: Tim Bray, a VP and engineer at Amazons AWS, resigned because of the companys treatment of employees, and was quoted as saying, in part, Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only thats not just Amazon, its how 21st-century capitalism is done If we dont like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things.
Eliminating human agency has been at the core of innovation during the last four decades. Less human intervention in a call center, a hedge fund trading desk, a factory, a checkout line or a motor vehicle seems fine but in cases of greater importance, humans should remain more active or we will, at best, make ourselves irrelevant. In the past, labor displacement has been temporary, but it seems to me that the next wave is likely to be different in terms of the permanence of labor allocation, and big tech getting bigger will likely hasten this.
Innovative capability has been at the center of progress and living standard improvements since we harnessed fire. The worlds technology portfolio is an exciting one, but potentially terrifying to those who could be more hampered by it, such as the front-line workers on Main Street shouldering the health and economic brunt of the coronavirus.
Years ago, Peter Drucker pointed out that technology has transformed from servant to master throughout our history. Regarding the assembly line, he noted that it does not use the strengths of the human being but, instead, subordinated human strengths to the requirements of the machine.
In my opinion, Drucker’s quote is at the very core of our point in time, happening on a scale and speed that is hard to fathom and changing the digital divide amongst us into a digital canyon between us and technology."

Growing public concern over the coronavirus prompted the annual San Francisco trade show's organizers to pull the plug ahead of their March 16 start date. In a statement released Friday night, GDC organizers said that they would ""postpone"" the gathering until ""later in the summer.""
The decision came on the heels of numerous pullouts, as major companies like Microsoft, Sony, Epic Games, Facebook, and Amazon (among many others) confirmed in recent weeks that they'd be bowing out. The new coronavirus, which is formally known as COVID-19, hasn't infected huge numbers in the United States yet, but there are signs that that's changing. (The CDC already said it's ""inevitable."")
The GDC email notes that passholders who were planning to attend will be getting a separate email about ""next steps"" regarding refunds, which will be given ""in full."" Separately, some as-yet-unknown number of planned presentations from the show will be made available online for free. The organizers are also looking into getting guest speakers to submit video versions of their planned talks.
Unlike E3, the annual GDC trade show is built more around digging deep on the actual practice of making games. Talks and workshops explore the various disciplines that are tied to game development and publishing. There's also a big piece of the show that's geared around recruitment and hiring.
Even though it's more of an industry-focused event, GDC is still often a place where publishers and studios of all sizes come to reveal what they're working on. Mid-March may still bring an onslaught of such news, but it won't be against the backdrop of a bustling trade show.
SEE ALSO: Worried about coronavirus? Stop touching your face.
As of now, GDC organizers haven't said anything more specific about the timing or makeup of a possible summer version of the show. Like many things tied to this new coronavirus, a lot of those decisions will probably hinge significantly on how the illness continues to spread and whether or not the arrival of spring and the formal end of cold and flu season slows it down.
The full text of the GDC statement follows:
After close consultation with our partners in the game development industry and community around the world, weve made the difficult decision to postpone the Game Developers Conference this March.
Having spent the past year preparing for the show with our advisory boards, speakers, exhibitors, and event partners, we're genuinely upset and disappointed not to be able to host you at this time.
We want to thank all our customers and partners for their support, open discussions and encouragement. As everyone has been reminding us, great things happen when the community comes together and connects at GDC. For this reason, we fully intend to host a GDC event later in the summer. We will be working with our partners to finalize the details and will share more information about our plans in the coming weeks.

A person in Washington state died after contracting the novel coronavirus, health authorities announced on Saturday. It is the first death attributed to the virus in the U.S.
We are dealing with an emergency evolving situation, Amy Reynolds, of the Washington state health department, told the Associated Press. A spokesperson for EvergreenHealth Medical Center in King County, Washington confirmed to the AP that the patient died there, but gave no other details.
It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. 
We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.

It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends, Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, said in a statement. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.
The news of the death comes one day after three new cases of coronavirus with unknown origin were reported in the United States. Before this week, the only confirmed cases of the virus in the country originated after a person traveled to an area of the world hard-hit by the disease, or developed after a person had close contact with a confirmed case. Cases with unknown origins are alarming to health authorities because their presence indicates that the disease is likely circulating within the population. 
The virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has spread to 57 countries around the world since it emerged in China in December. The respiratory disease has infected more than 85,000 people and killed more than 2,900. In the United States, 66 people with COVID-19 have been identified.
The healthcare industry is bracing for the virus. In California, 124 nurses and other healthcare workers at UC Davis Hospital, have been told to quarantine themselves at home, a healthcare union said on Friday. They are believed to have been exposed to the virus at the hospital where one coronavirus patient sought treatment.

Here’s your Daily Crunch for February 28, 2020.
1. Facebook cancels F8 conference, citing coronavirus concerns
Facebook has confirmed that it has canceled its annual F8 developers conference over growing concerns about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. More specifically, the company says its canceling the in-person component” there may still be video presentations, along with live-streamed and local events, under the F8 umbrella.
At the same time, companies, including Microsoft, are pulling out of the Game Developers Conference over similar concerns. And the Geneva Motor Show was just canceled.
2. Clearview said its facial recognition app was only for law enforcement as it courted private companies
After claiming that it would only sell its controversial facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies, a new report in BuzzFeed News suggests that Clearview AI is less than discerning about its client base, and has in fact shopped its technology far and wide.
3. DocuSign acquires Seal Software for $188M to enhance its AI chops
Seal Software was founded in 2010, and, while it may not be a mainstream brand, its customers include the likes of PayPal, Dell, Nokia and DocuSign itself. (DocuSign previously invested in the company, too.) These businesses use Seal for its contract management tools, but also for its analytics, discovery and data extraction services.
4. Senate passes rip and replace bill to remove old Huawei and ZTE equipment from networks
Written as a response to recent concerns around Chinese hardware manufacturers, the bill would ban purchase of telecom equipment from embattled Chinese manufactures like Huawei and ZTE. It also includes $1 billion in funding to help smaller rural telecoms rip and replace existing equipment from specific manufacturers.

On Saturday the Washington Post reported that an agency within the State Department had compiled a report of two million tweets, which peddled conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.
Among the hoaxes compiled in the report and reported by the Post included the suggestion that the virus had been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or was the result of a bioweapon developed by the Chinese government.
In all, these tweets represent about 7 percent of the total tweets surveyed by the government, according to the Post’s reporting.
Critically, the report indicated that some of the misinformation spread online appeared to be the result of “inauthentic and coordinated activity,” the Post reported the document saying.
The report mirrors warnings from cybersecurity firms like Check Point Software, which issued a report tracking the launch of new websites linked to themes around the coronavirus outbreak earlier this month.
According to the company’s Global Threat Index for January 2020, “cyber-criminals are exploiting interest in the global epidemic to spread malicious activity, with several spam campaigns relating to the outbreak of the virus.”
The company correlated Google search terms with what it deemed to be “malicious discussions” about the virus, and showed them to be tightly correlated.
In one instance, a hacking campaign targeting web users in Japan distributed malicious email attachments by pretending to be a Japanese disability welfare service provider. The email provided misinformation about the spread of the coronavirus in several Japanese cities, and when a user opened an attachment to the email, they downloaded a modular, self-propagating Trojan virus onto their computer.
Email campaigns represent one threat, but another one that the security firm tracked was new websites with domain names linked to the virus.
The company already spotted one fake website, “vaccinecovid-19.com”. It was first created on February 11, 2020 and registered in Russia. According to Check Point, “the website is insecure, and offers to sell ‘the best and fastest test for Coronavirus detection at the fantastic price of 19,000 Russian rubles (about US$300)’.
Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter have all taken steps to remove misinformation about the novel coronavirus from their platforms including advertisements offering purported cures for the disease.
Earlier this month, the big tech companies met with representatives of the World Health Organization to come up with a plan and coordinate on ways to combat misinformation and scams online.
Earlier this week, Facebook issued the following statement about its continuing response to misinformation campaigns on the site:
As world health officials issue new guidance and warnings about coronavirus (COVID-19), were continuing our work to connect people to information from regional and local health organizations and limit the spread of misinformation and harmful content about the virus.
Connecting People to Accurate Information and Helpful Resources
Anyone who searches for information related to the virus on Facebook is shown educational pop-ups on top of search results connecting them to expert health organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO). Weve launched these globally over the last few weeks in all languages on Facebook, directing people to the WHO. In several countries we are directing people to their local ministry of health. For example, in the US we are directing people to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in Singapore, were directing people to the Singapore Ministry of Health. Moreover, in countries where the WHO has reported person-to-person transmission and deaths, weve shown additional messages to people toward the top of News Feed with more information."

Most of the major sponsors have withdrawn.
5 with 5 posters participating
Attempts to contain and mitigate the spread of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 are wreaking havoc on travel plans around the globe, and the annual Game Developers Conference is no exception. The majority of major sponsors for GDC 2020 in San Francisco have already pulled out a little more than two weeks ahead of the event's scheduled March 16 start. As of publication time, however, the event is still on, which raises the question: what would it take to make the GDC cancel?
On February 28 (Friday), GDC posted an update saying, ""We are closely monitoring the COVID19 (coronavirus) situation and want to assure everyone that your health and safety are a top priority. If our assessment of the situation changes, based on new and evolving developments or updated information, we will promptly update this statement regarding the status of GDC 2020 accordingly."" 
Sony and Facebook both backed out on February 20, the first of the dominoes to fall. Since then, other cancellations have followed rapidly. EA and Kojima Productions both backed out on February 24, then Unity, Microsoft, Epic Games (and Unreal Engine) bowed out on February 27, with Amazon and Activision/Blizzard following on February 28.
Most of those companies are not only major presenters and presences at the conference, they're also major sponsors. While the companies that have backed out represent only a small fraction of the total planned exhibitors, they occupy an outsize amount of space at the showextremely literally. A map of the show floor, where the scheduled booth space of companies that have cancelled is blacked out, looks dire:
Enlarge/ There be absolutely no digital dragons here, because the companies that render them aren't coming. (As of 3:00pm Eastern, Friday Feb. 28.)
GDC is not the first event to have to make the go/no-go call in the face of COVID-19, and it will not be the last. The world's biggest telecom show, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Spain, was cancelled earlier this month after vendors backed out. The Geneva Motor Show was also cancelled after Switzerland put a temporary ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Nor are smaller gatherings immune: The Eve Online fanfest, scheduled for April in Reykjavik, has also been cancelled, as has Facebook's own F8 developer conference, which would have started May 5."

With the dizzying international spread of the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization Friday announced that the global threat of COVID-19 has increased. The risk of spread and risk of impact has now risen from high to very high on a global scale, according to the organizations latest assessments.
Between Thursday and Friday, five additional countries identified their first casesBelarus, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Nigeriaand large outbreaks in Italy (888 cases) and Iran (388 cases) continue to export cases. So far, at least 24 cases in 14 countries link back to Italy and at least 97 cases in 11 countries link back to Iran, WHO reported Friday.
Worldwide, there are more than 85,400 cases and 2,924 deaths, with 53 countries reporting cases in addition to China, as of Saturday morning. While China still has over 90 percent of those cases, the daily case counts outside of China are now exceeding those within.
On Friday, China reported 331 new cases, while there were 1,027 cases reported elsewhere, according the WHOs latest situation report. The largest outbreak outside of China is currently in South Korea, which has reported 3,150 cases. Italy has the second-largest cluster of cases, followed by the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess, which has now reached 705 cases.
The continued spread and rising case counts outside China are clearly of concern, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday in a media briefing.
Wake up
Yet, while that spread ratchets up risk, he and his fellow experts at WHO also saw reason to be hopeful: most of the cases cropping up in new places can be clearly linked back to known contacts and clusters of casessuch as those from Italy and Iran.
We do not see evidence as yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities, the director-general, who goes by Dr. Tedros, said Friday. As long as thats the case, we still have a chance of containing this virusif robust action is taken to detect cases early, isolate and care for patients, and trace contacts.
And theres clear evidence that containment can work. In addition to Chinas dramatic decline in cases over this month, eight countries with identified cases have gone two weeks without reporting new cases, Dr. Tedros said. And, as of the time of publication Saturday, 15 of the 53 countries with cases were reporting only one new case. Another 19 countries with cases tallied 10 or fewer.
Moreover, Dr. Tedros made a point of putting the global cases in perspective: there are 6,000 or so cases among the more than 6 billion people outside of China.
This virus is serious and dangerous, but it can be contained, Dr. Tedros emphasized.
In fact, the move to increase the threat level should get that very point across, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, said in the briefing.
This is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up. Get ready. This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready. You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world, to be ready, and I think thats what this alert says. It says we can avoid the worst of this, but our level of concern is at its highest.
Not ready
Such readiness to avoid the worst has, unfortunately, not been on display in the United States, so far.
As of Saturday morning, the United States has reported four COVID-19 cases that may represent instances of community spread. That is, the four people may have picked up the infection from people in their own community as the virus spread undetected through the general public. In all four cases, the infected people had no known exposure through travel and had no contact with a person known to be infected.
Its an alarming sign that the USdespite its prominence on the world stage and the time it has had to prepareis failing to detect and contain the virus.
Among the four cases, two are in California, one is in Oregon, and another is in Washington state. Three of the cases (excluding one in California) are considered presumptive for now, meaning that health authorities in the individual states have tested the patients and found them positive, but final confirmation from CDC testing is pending.
The cases, if all are confirmed, bring the countrys tally to at least 66. Of those, 44 are in passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess, and three are in people repatriated from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began in December.
Thirteen cases appear to be travel-related, and two additional cases were contracted from person-to-person spread in the US from a known travel-related case.
The four remaining cases were possibly community spread. One of those casesa California woman who lives in Solano Countywas announced earlier this week. The news cycle was still reeling from it when, late on Friday, news broke of the other three cases.
Testing, testing
The Solano County womans case is particularly worrying because it highlights several weaknesses in the countrys COVID-19 preparedness. The woman reportedly checked into a local hospital with flu-like symptoms February 15. The patient was initially suspected of having COVID-19. But the woman wasnt tested until February 25, largely due to a low availability of testing and federal recommendations that testing focus on people with known exposures (and she had no known exposure). Between that time, her condition deteriorated, and she was intubated and put on a ventilator.
The first clear weakness is the low availability of testing, which has mainly been done in labs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has sent testing kits to states, but some states reported problems with their kits. The CDC has been trying to work out an unspecified glitch in the kits, but the process has been slow. So far, the CDC has reported testing 459 people, which is just a fraction of the number of people that have been tested in other countries.
This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a press briefing Friday. She reported that the CDC has come up with a workaround that will allow states to increase testing.
Increased testing capacity is critical for identifying new cases and preventing further spread of the virus within the US, particularly with the possibility of community spreadand the community in which the first case was identified points to another weakness.
Suspicious spread
The first case of potential community spread occurred in Solano County, California, which just happens to be were hundreds of repatriated citizensat high risk of carrying the virushave been quarantined. Repatriated citizens began arriving at Travis Air Force Base, located in Solano, at the beginning of February, a week or two before the woman developed symptoms. The potential community spread near where high-risk groups of people have been housed raises the possibility that the quarantine failed.
That concern was reinforced by news of a whistleblower allegation that the Department of Health and Human Services sent untrained personnel without proper protective gear to handle those high-risk repatriated citizens. If true, HHS put employees at risk of contracting the virus and then spreading it to their families and communities.
According to the whistleblowers complaint, 13 unprepared employees were sent to Travis Air Force Base in Solano between February 2 and February 7, when planes loaded with repatriated citizens were arriving. The complaint alleges the employees were not tested for coronavirus afterward and returned to their normal offices and duties, with some taking commercial flights back to their stations in various, unspecified parts of the country.
The CDC did not respond to questions from Ars regarding the potential that the quarantine at Travis Air Force Base closed.
The three other, potentially community-spread cases appear to be unconnected to the Solano woman, according to The Washington Post. One case is in a 65-year-old woman from Santa Clara County, California. The case in Oregon was in a person from Washington County who had spent time in an elementary school near Portland. That school has now been closed for cleaning. The case in Washington state is in a high school student from Snohomish County, just north of Seattle. That students school has also been closed, and students with known contact are being isolated at home for 14 days.
The cases are an alarming sign that the US has failed its duty to be ready and has already lost control of the virus.
Communication breakdown
Last, reports this week raised concern of yet another weakness in the countrys preparednessthat information about the virus and the situation in the United States may be being censored by the Trump administration. According to a report Friday in The New York Times, all statements and appearances from federal officials regarding the coronavirusincluding, it seems, those from CDC officialsmust now be filtered through the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who President Trump appointed Wednesday to lead the coronavirus response.
The move has reportedly buttoned up leading experts, notably Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the countrys foremost experts on viruses and infectious disease and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. According to the Times, Dr. Fauci has told colleagues that the White House instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.
Likewise, in the CDCs briefing Friday, Dr. Messonniers comments sounded more carefully vetted than normal and included a conspicuous reference to President Trump. It marked the first time the CDC had referenced the president in a briefing on COVID-19 cases, according to transcripts of the briefings.
As always, President Trumps and our number-one priority is the health and safety of the American people, Dr. Messonnier said in her opening remarks Friday.
The CDC declined to a request to comment from Ars on the reported censorship.
According to CDCs archive of transcripts, Dr. Messonnier had only mentioned the word trump on one other occasion, on February 3, when she said, And certainly, what Ive seen in situations like this, science should trump everything else."

The company has confirmed plans to cut a large portion of its workforce after the union representing Kickstarter employees said it had ratified a layoff agreement on May 1st. Layoffs could affect up to 45 percent of Kickstarter staff. 
Last week, Lyft laid off nearly 1,000 of its employees, and rumors suggest Uber may have to address its headcount, again, soon. GoPro and Magic Leap have also adjusted their staffing levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It’s a time of mixed fortunes. We’re in the middle of earnings season, and tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Apple have had mixed fortunes. The latter has suffered from reduced hardware sales -- that happens when your stores are closed -- while Microsoft saw ‘minimal’ impact on its business and Facebook has seen a jump in its audience figures as people stay indoors and connect to their screens.

Tesla has applied for a license to become a UK energy provider 
The company may bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain.
Tesla has reportedly applied for a license to become an energy provider in the UK. That means it might bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain, much as it did with its 100-megawatt installation in South Australia. It may also be a way for the company to introduce a platform called Autobidder, which allows renewable power suppliers to trade energy.
The company hasn’t confirmed any plans for large-scale PowerPacks in the UK, but the country generates 40 percent of its energy from renewables, including wind and solar, which means the system would make sense, smoothing out gaps in renewable energy production. 
Tesla could also deploy its new platform, Autobidder, which uses machine-learning tech and cloud platforms to optimize power distribution. It’s a dry topic but could make power production more efficient. Continue reading.

Juul may exit France, Spain and other European markets
It reportedly has nothing to do with COVID-19.
Juul is preparing to leave five European countries within the year.  Unlike all the shutdowns and layoffs reported over the past months, BuzzFeed’s source says the decision didn’t have anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic.
The e-cigarette maker is reportedly planning to pull out of Austria, Belgium, Portugal and Spain in July, followed by France at the end of the year. Juul enjoys relatively high sales in Spain and France compared to the rest of the continent, but not high enough to justify the costs and the trouble of dealing with regulators. The European Union has stringent requirements when it comes to e-cigarette products, as the publication notes, requiring companies to stick to a nicotine limit of 20 milligrams per milliliter of fluid. Meanwhile, in the US, a single Juul pod can contain up to 59 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter. Continue reading.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)How bad will it get? That was the question this week, but it applied to several things: the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus around the world, the resulting stock market plunge and the concern about whether America's political leaders are up to the challenge.
An outbreak of the disease is inevitable in the US, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tuesday: ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but ... a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."" 
Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner, wrote that the disease ""will test our government's response and resiliency. How we weather the outbreak also hinges on our trust that the government has our best intentions at heart."" She added that, ""we don't yet know if the trajectory of COVID-19 will be mild, moderate, or severe"" but it makes sense to prepare for the worst case. 
Wall Street apparently agreed, with the Dow plunging 3,583 points, making it by percentage terms the worst week since October, 2008. In the Perspectives section of CNN Business, Paul LaMonica recalled covering that financial crisis. ""That was a terrifying time but this seems a lot scarier,"" he wrote. ""Yes, the Fed can do lots of things to help soothe frayed nerves when stocks are in free fall, but there is little that the Fed or President Trump and Congress, for that matter can do to solve this biological crisis for the markets and the economy.""
""Even if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That's because China has become a global economic powerhouse."" And by now the virus has gone well beyond the borders of China.
""The best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts -- not to the President. He's not telling the truth. He's gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts,"" Ghitis wrote. She noted, ""It's not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump's 'black swan,' the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection.""
In the Washington Post, David Ignatius wrote that, ""one of President Trump's failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors...Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner's suggestion that the CDC was 'exaggerating' the threat."" Taking it further, at a South Carolina rally Friday, Trump said, ""the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus"" in what he called ""their new hoax.""
Presidents are called upon to reassure the nation in the wake of traumatic events, wrote Joe Lockhart -- Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn after the 9/11 attacks. So far, Trump is failing that leadership test, Lockhart said. ""He has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home.""
Chelsea Clinton and the co-author of her book on global health, Devi Sridhar, noted that, ""President Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress."" 
Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the effort to combat the virus. ""It's hard to imagine a worse choice for a job that requires respect for public health,"" wrote Pence biographer Michael D'Antonio. ""In addition to his climate-change skepticism...he is known for penning, when he was running for Congress, what could be generously termed a nutty article that said, 'despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill.'"" 
As we wait to see the extent of the virus outbreak, here's some useful advice from Dr. Colleen Kraft, the associate medical director of Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: ""Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers.""
The Democratic primary is at a critical moment. Joe Biden scored a decisive victory Saturday in South Carolina, but will he have the momentum to unseat Bernie Sanders as the Democrats' frontrunner? 
""Moderate voters may well snap back into the Biden camp,"" wrote Jeff Yang, ""and other centrist candidates may feel the pressure to make an increasingly hard decision: Whether to stay in the race and continue to fragment the vote against Sanders or bow out and lend support to Biden."" 
On Super Tuesday, March 3, roughly a third of the delegates will be chosen and the race could be decided within weeks -- or remain hotly contested until the Democrats meet for their convention in Milwaukee in July.
Elliot Williams summed up the moderates' feeling: Sanders ""struggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). He all but ensures that his Republican opponent will make the election a referendum on socialism...Attack ads from President Donald Trump and his allies assailing Sanders' views on Fidel Castro and Soviet Russia practically write themselves. And don't get me started about the conduct of some of his supporters and even some of his staffers online."" 
""Take a deep breath"" anyway, Williams added. ""Bernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump -- maybe even a better one."" 
When Sanders praised some aspects of dictator Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, critics called it an unforced error and said it would hurt him badly with Cuban-American emigres in Florida. Rebecca Bodenheimer agreed that it was ""ill-advised"" but argued that it wasn't wrong: ""Both the things he said were true: the Castro regime (and the successive iterations of it under Raúl Castro and now Miguel Díaz-Canel) was and is authoritarian...And, early on in the 1960s, Castro initiated a grassroots program that resulted in a massive increase in literacy in Cuba, as well as building a strong universal healthcare and educational system.""
Sanders is stirring excitement around the country, Dean Obeidallah noted: ""Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000. Two weeks ago, the night before the New Hampshire primary, Sanders packed more than 7,500 into an arena, with USA Today noting that this 'event easily marked the largest in the Democratic contest in New Hampshire.'""
The Vermont senator could win it all, wrote John Avlon, but he has a hill to climb because he's out of sync with much of the country ideologically. ""Bernie Sanders has built a movement and he has momentum. But there are plenty of rational reasons to think that nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk -- and could deliver Donald Trump a second term."" 
A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent contemplated the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race with real dread. ""Both represent two sides of the same coin,"" Dent wrote. ""They both appeal to anger. They scream that the system is rigged, you're a victim, and that they can give you your country back if only you follow them."" 
Millions of voters are in the middle, between the left and the right, he said. They ""want a candidate who believes in capitalism, reasonably regulated market-based solutions to problems, social tolerance and acceptance, and constructive international engagement...Most of all they'll want someone who conducts himself or herself in a thoughtful, deliberate and measured way. They want stability, not chaos and recklessness."" 
A food fight in South Carolina
The Democrats' South Carolina debate was fierce, with the moderators letting candidates talk over each other. It ""was somewhere between an episode of 'The Jerry Springer Show' and a 'Real Housewives' reunion: messy, chaotic and embarrassing for nearly everyone involved,"" wrote Raul Reyes. 
""It was inevitable that, as the stakes have grown higher in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, there would be a greater sense of urgency among the candidates to stand out. But that did not mean the event had to devolve into a free-for-all."" 
""Moderates across the country exhaled a collective sigh of relief after Tuesday's debate,"" wrote Tara Setmayer. ""Joe Biden is back. It was clear the former Vice President was much more comfortable and cogent on the debate stage this time around in South Carolina.""
Elizabeth Warren picked up where she left off at the Nevada debate, with blistering attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg. But the former New York mayor seemed much more prepared this time. ""Mayor Michael Bloomberg fought his way back into contention in the Democratic primary for president by obeying a simple rule: never let an attack go unanswered,"" wrote Errol Louis.
The sheer force of Bloomberg's money cascade is keeping him a major factor in the election. He could wind up spending billions on advertising in pursuit of the presidency, wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, who argued that whatever its political impact, it is a financially savvy move. 
""As an aging billionaire many times over, Mayor Bloomberg sees the clock ticking."" Bloomberg's fortune has been estimated at more than $60 billion. Whatever he doesn't spend or give away will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax.
So if he spends $5 billion to get to the White House, the US Treasury will ultimately lose out on $2 billion in taxes, McCaffery pointed out.
""This is in no way a condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg, who has presumably earned his money legally, and can spend it however he wants, again perfectly legally... It is, rather, a condemnation of a tax system that both allows some billionaires to amass wealth and to spend it, tax free and with no questions asked."" 
After the Harvey Weinstein verdict
The onetime Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault and rape charges that could send him to prison for a minimum of five years. It was a win for the #MeToo movement, wrote Caroline Polisi. 
The ""verdict will encourage more victims of sexual assault to come forward and report their abuse, with the knowledge that although the road to justice will not be easy, it will at least be a possibility. And that is so much more than they ever had before."" 
Two things have to happen now, wrote Kara Alaimo. There needs to be more visibility about non-disclosure agreements that have been used to bury allegations against powerful abusers, she said.
""Second, lawmakers need to help victims learn their rights and avenues for redress -- especially those who are most disenfranchised. If it's hard for Hollywood actresses like Ashley Judd -- whose sexual harassment case against Weinstein was thrown out of court by a judge and characterized as not justified by Weinstein's attorney -- to pursue justice, consider how difficult it would be for people with far fewer resources.""
A raid on the fifth grade 
Wazhma Frogh is nearly 40 but she can't forget the raid on her Kabul public school when she was in fifth grade.
""I still remember the exact words of those bearded men, Kalashnikovs on their shoulders, batons in their hand -- as they yelled, 'Get out of here. Girls don't belong in schools!' I can even remember the cries of several of our teachers, who were wearing skirts and were beaten in their legs, as the Mujahedeen shouted that their skirt wearing days were over.""
It was the start of a civil war that closed down the schools. Frogh, now the leader of the Women and Peace Studies organization in Kabul, wrote that she ""never saw my classmates or my teachers ever again.""
She argued that, as the US embarks on a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, it's vital that the experience of the early 1990s -- ""when civil war and extremist forces came to dominate our politics and our lives"" -- not be repeated. 
Peter Bergen wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. ""For the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and he could just as easily pull the plug entirely."" The agreement calls for a full withdrawal over a 14-month period but officials say that is dependent on what the Taliban does.
Katharine Johnson, an American hero
Katharine Johnson was so central to NASA's exploration of space that, as Reshma Saujani wrote, ""Astronaut John Glenn famously asked Katherine to personally recheck the calculations made by electronic computers before his Friendship 7 mission to space. 'If she says they're good,' he said, 'then I'm ready to go.'"" On that mission in 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.
Johnson, who died this week at 101, lived to see her story told in the Oscar-nominated film ""Hidden Figures."" She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson. ""In a world that all too often tells girls -- especially black girls -- that they don't belong in STEM, Katherine Johnson was exactly the icon our girls needed,"" wrote Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit.
""Katherine was the epitome of bravery. When she was told that women didn't participate in the briefings at NASA; she asked whether there was a law against it. There wasn't. So Katherine started attending briefings. She asked questions. She, bravely, put herself in the rooms where she knew she deserved to be."""

As researchers investigate, musical ensembles prepare for the show to go on.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-behind-orchestras-careful-covid-comeback/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5edac37e609ca7f4d498988b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_orchestra_974087896.jpg",2020-06-08T11:00:00Z,"Last month, members of the Berlin Philharmonic returned home to their concert hall after weeks of isolation. They sat onstage in a loose constellation, dispersed according to local virus regulations. Only 15 players could be onstage at a time. The strings sat two meters apart. The woodwinds and brass sat five meters aparton account of them blowing great quantities of air during a global respiratory virus pandemic, without the benefit of masks. They played music by Ligeti, Pärt, and Barber. And at the end of the performance, they bowed, smiling vaguely into an empty, silent hall. A classical music critic for The New York Times, watching the performance live from his apartment, described it as awkward but also inspiring.
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
Sebastian Nordmann, the director of the Konzerthaus, home of another Berlin orchestra, watched their return to the stage with interest. His orchestra had done its share of virtual experiments: a streaming concert with the pianist Lang Lang; a series of one-on-one recitals between orchestra musicians and listeners who called them on the phone. Nordmann had also given a virtual tour of the historic Konzerthaus building, which turns 200 next year. But he was growing tired of listening at a distance. Digital is entertaining but it gets boring, Nordmann says. Thats not our real focus. Our focus is analog concerts in our hall. Its a different quality of listening. The questionfor him and for musicians everywhereis how to do that safely.
On the list of human joys we hope will return once the world is through the worst of Covid-19, orchestras are usually at the end. This is a matter of managing expectations: orchestras, after all, are a very large crowd of people, coming together in intimate proximity indoors, many of them blowing into instruments vigorously for hours at a time. Plus, musical gatherings have already been implicated in viral spread. In Washington state, a single sick person attending choir practice is thought to have caused 52 additional infections. At churches, hymn-singing congregations have been hotbeds of viral spreading, too (even if the White House doesnt want to hear about it).
The epidemiological evidence is compelling, says Shelly Miller, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Colorado. But still, from the standpoint of a lab scientist like her, its anecdotal. The precise means of transmission during those choral-linked episodes requires more investigation. Was it infectious spittle spewed as the singers enunciated their hard ts? Or was it something unique about the breath involved in singingthe way they forced air from deep in their lungsthat did the trick? That might have played a role in generating aerosols: very small particles that hang around in the air and produce a cloud of infection that is inhaled. Or perhaps it wasnt Verdi or Mozarts fault at all. Maybe the singers all just convened around the same ill-fated snack table.
For the risks of singing, there are clues in the scientific literature, primarily from studies on breathing and talking that go back to the 1950s, when the primary interest was in stopping measles. One observation is that loud vocalizations mean more aerosols. (In the choral super-spreader events, Miller suspects inhalation of aerosols is the major culprit.) But for instruments, researchers lack even that basic background to assess the risks and proper precautions, she says. At the behest of a group of school music associations, she began a study on the question last week.
The primary concern lurks in the back of the orchestra: the woodwinds and brass. Its a diverse bunch of instruments. How do the emissions from the enormous bell of a tuba compare with a straight-shooting flute? The coiled tubes of a French horn with an oboe? In many ways they dont, really. There are differences in the way the air flows through the instrument, and in how the players draw their breathsdo the droplets come from the mouth, or deep in the lungs? Some instruments require blowing through reeds, or wider metal mouthpieces. Those factors likely affect what kinds of particles are produced, how long those particles hang in the air, and the amount of infectious virus they ultimately bear. For each instrument, a new set of questions needs to be asked. And until now, no one really has."

In New York, thousands are planning a rent strike for May, while landlords ask for a federal bailout.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-rent-strikes/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5eab4b42b94d688c19aebbb8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Cul-rentstrike-AP_20092709811232.jpg",2020-05-01T15:34:45Z,"To prevent people from losing their homes while shelter-in-place orders remain, many cities and states have issued eviction moratoria, including New York state. We were initially encouraged that states and localities were taking action to try and keep people housed amid the pandemic, Alieza Durana, a strategist at Princetons Eviction Lab, says. But the rickety nature of these Band-Aid measures soon became apparent.
There are some pretty substantial gaps in terms of who is covered, where they're covered, under what conditions, Durana says. For example, while losing a job can make people eligible for rental assistance programs, these patchwork relief options can be hard to access and insufficient at covering costs. The backlog is enormous in some states.
Moreover, these measures are a small comfort for the newly unemployed, who often do not know how they are going to pay a single months rent, let alone catch up on missed payments. The idea that families would somehow have saved enough to anticipate a global pandemic that no one knew was coming is, frankly, ridiculous, Durana says.
And yet: management at both Jeffers and Thorntons buildings have already sent letters to tenants explaining that they are expected to pay up. Jeffers worries about what will happen when the moratorium lifts on June 20, and landlords demand back pay. Court is going to be filled, she says.

While the concept of a strike is often framed as radical, the action is essentially pragmatic, especially for tenants who feel they have no other recourse. A rent strike is a bid to gain leverage over landlords through collective bargaining. Sometimes tenants strike to push for building repairs or to discourage planned rent increases. In this case, the ultimate goal is to shape government policy. If a critical mass of tenants refuse to pay, advocates think it will push landlords, particularly powerful real estate companies, to use their lobbying weight to advocate for housing bailouts. Its a tactic to shift the financial burden away from individuals and towards institutions. Its a risky onepeople who participate in the strike could be evicted after the moratorium liftsbut the agitators are hoping the united front and moral imperative are persuasive.
Rent strikes are already happening at a commercial level, although they are not always being framed as such. The Cheesecake Factory, for example, sent a letter to the landlords for its franchise locations explaining that it was not paying its rent because of the extraordinary events of the pandemic. This is not necessarily because The Cheesecake Factorys leadership has embraced a leftist ideology; it is more probably because not paying rent is simply the most rational option when theres no money in the bank. (The Cheesecake Factory declined to comment.)
Several tenants WIRED interviewed described how theyd first attempted to negotiate for lowered rents before choosing to strike. At Thorntons building, which is owned by the management firm Guardian Realty, the tenants say they originally asked their management for a temporary 50 percent rent reduction during the shelter-in-place order. We were completely shut down, Thornton says. Instead, management informed tenants that they were expected to continue full payments on time. With so many tenants unable to do so, around 20 of the 47 units in the building decided to participate in a formal rent strike.
In Crown Heights, Brooklyn, writer and editor Maxwell Paparella and his neighbors also attempted to negotiate a rent discount after realizing a substantial portion of the people in their 36-unit mid-rise building would struggle to make payments this spring. That proposal was rejected, Paparella says. Two-thirds of the units have decided to participate in a strike action, and delivered a notice to management in April. Many tenants simply do not have the funds to pay. Others are withholding rent in solidarity. The buildings landlord, Isaac Schwartz, controls a hefty real estate portfolio. We believe he can shoulder at least some of the burden of this crisis, Paparella says. (Schwartz and Guardian Reality did not respond to messages seeking comment.)
Graduate students at Columbia University are planning to strike for rent relief from the prestigious institution following similar logicthe school has a $10.9 billion endowment, and is better equipped to deal with any potential financial fallout from withheld rent than cash-strapped academics. They have a lot more money on hand than a traditional landlord, law student Gus Leinbach says. Theyre in an easier situation to cancel rent for three months for us.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, rent strikes are not popular among landlords. When you're talking about rent strikes, you're talking about actually hurting your fellow tenants as much, if not more than landlords themselves, says Jay Martin, the executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an advocacy group representing 4,000 landlords. Without bailouts for landlords as well as tenants, Martin envisions a New York with banks as the largest landlords, mercilessly seizing buildings across boroughs and tossing out delinquent renters and owners alike."

Departing
On the night of March 13, before my flight from Philadelphia back to China, my Airbnb host stopped by my room to say goodbye. I was squeezing a stack of masks and a few bottles of hand sanitizer into my suitcase. They were the remaining stock of coronavirus protective items that I panic-bought in early February as soon as I landed in the U.S. As China’s production picked up speed, I gave away most of my supplies — which I had planned to bring back to my family in China — to friends and relatives in the U.S.
I had also asked my host, a slender, high-spirited botanist in her early fifties, whether she needed any supplies when I arrived at her house in early March. She gave a relaxed smile and said she wasn’t worried. There had barely been any cases in Philly, so there was no need. Plus, she had never worn a mask.
“People think you’re sick if you wear one,” she refused politely. “Why do people in Asia wear them?”
I explained that there’s a big debate on whether masks were necessary for the public. The consensus was that they were effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Health officials in the West had for long recommended them only for patients or someone in contact with those who were sick, though the U.S. has recently moved to suggest mask-wearing for everyone in public.
In Asia, however, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the disease’s incubation period could be as long as 27 days, which meant many people could be unwitting carriers, wearing masks became an act of solidarity to protect others. Chinese cities had early on mandated mask-wearing in public. For me, they worked both as a placebo and a reminder not to touch my face.
Within a week’s time, the disease had advanced rapidly across the U.S., adding dozens of new cases in Philadelphia. All large events were suspended, and my host suffered from a handful of canceled stays.
I decided to ask her again whether she wanted any protective products. “Yes, that’d be great. I don’t have any sanitizers with me. No masks, either.” Her eyes lit up this time. “But how do you wear one?”
I handed her the items and realized that I was about to flee coronavirus for the second time. When I planned my visit to the U.S. a few months back, I had not the faintest idea it would spiral into two great escapes: first leaving China where the disease just began to spread, and later leaving the U.S. where a similar crisis was taking form.
Weeks 1-2: Fears in parallel worlds
I was getting restless when I left for the U.S. some 50 days ago. Objectively speaking, my chances of contracting COVID-19 were slim. I was previously in lightly-hit cities like Taipei (which was an early mover in putting effective control in place). And 99% of the passengers on my flight departing Hong Kong had masks on. But the sum of uncertain events triggered by the epidemic — from abrupt changes in border controls to canceled flights without notice — elevated my anxiety.
Things felt uncannily normal in Texas when I arrived. It was three weeks before the U.S. reported its first community transmission in late February. None of the screening I anticipated was present at immigration: no temperature checks or even questioning if I had been in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first coronavirus case appeared. I felt relieved and immediately chucked the mask I had worn on the plane. “It’s safe here,” I thought to myself, seeking solace in the sight of the bare-faced crowd, even though I knew my decision was largely prompted by the prejudice against masks in this part of the world.
My relaxation was short-lived. In fact, I would live the next eight weeks swinging between reason and paranoia.
The relatives and friends with whom I had planned to stay could no longer host me. Their employers, both of Asian descent, had introduced a new 14-day self-quarantine rule on staff who came into contact with visitors from China even though Texas had no such regulation.

Technically, I could roam free, but fears amongst the local Chinese community were too visible. The digital tools that kept the diaspora emotionally close to home also distanced them from their physical reality abroad. Consuming a flood of fearmongering posts on WeChat, many Chinese expatriates began hoarding household products long before the U.S. saw an outbreak. Chinatowns became ghost towns. My mother was shocked to learn only Asians were wearing masks and messaged me daily saying I should wear one and avoid crowds.
I followed only the latter advice — avoiding crowds — and voluntarily opted for 14-day social distancing, not because I was scared of getting infected but because I was paranoid about passing it onto others asymptomatically. My compulsive information seeking in hopes of better understanding the epidemic only reinforced my angst. No silence I had dealt with felt as unbearable as the isolation amid the immense uncertainties that coronavirus brought to all of humanity.
Weeks 2-5: Coming to terms
When I finally allowed myself to resume socializing two weeks later, I would disclose to people that I had recently been in China out of courtesy. The reactions I received were a mixed bag.
Most of my American friends expressed sympathy for China’s situation and were pleased I was in a safer place. A local dentist refused to see me until 21 days later — then the longest time for a patient to display COVID-19 symptoms — because he lived with someone who was frail. Some Chinese friends living in the U.S. jokingly congratulated me on my escape from the plague, which wasn’t my intention but I admitted I was lucky. A fifty-something Chinese acquaintance avoided shaking my hand and gingerly asked how long I had been in the U.S.
I tried not to be bothered by people’s hint of mistrust. After all, their response was driven by the human instinct to survive. Trust had also eroded with the spread of the epidemic in China, where neighbors avoided conversations and a person’s sneeze in the elevator would make others cringe. Though understandable, these small shifts in behavior could take a toll on social interaction and people’s mental health in the long run.
By then, I knew I probably had a clean bill of health. It helped that Texas was run on wheels and I could easily practice social distancing walking on empty, tree-lined streets. As my mind restored to peace, and I moved to Philadelphia for the second part of my U.S. trip, I began to devour the expanding trove of Chinese-language writings on the disease; they were perhaps one silver lining behind the dark virus cloud.
Trapped indoors, Chinese people were forced to contemplate difficult questions — though sometimes leading to unintended consequences like a rise in divorce cases. The unusual level of civic engagement and discussion sparked by the crisis provided some consolation. Stories of ordinary people fighting illness were vividly told by institutional and citizen journalists. The death of whistleblower Li Wenliang set off an unprecedented amount of anger on the internet. Another enthralling moment came when internet users rushed to preserve a censored interview using coded text.
The unusual, collective outcry against Chinese authorities soon gave way to a fragmented digital world. As China’s heavy-handed lockdown began to bear meaningful results, online users rushed to trumpet the country’s contingency plan. Others submerged in the more mindless activities of mobile gaming and video streaming to pass time. Meanwhile, schools and businesses moved to resume digitally with IT support touted by private tech firms.

The offline world in China was also inching back to normalcy. Physical shops were allowed to reopen and restrictions on movement were being eased nationwide. People increasingly ventured out of their homes, taking masks off to sneak sips of fresh air when guards were out of sight.
For others, the daily routine hadn’t changed much, though life had become more precarious. While it was easy for high-earning professionals to attend virtual meetings and celebrate the remote working boom, those working in services, manufacturing and logistics had not been able to stay home but worked round the clock to sustain society’s lifeblood. They were also unlikely to have paid leave and many lacked employer-provided health insurance. As it turned out, this is just one manifestation of disparity exposed by the health crisis.
Week 6: The price of seeking safety
I knew China was on the horizon as soon as I arrived at my flight’s departure gate. The crowd was uniformly wearing some kind of a face protector. I hadn’t put one on yet. I had been adjusted to a maskless environment for weeks by then and it didn’t seem necessary to wear one during the layover in Chicago, where I cautiously kept a distance from others. There were barely any masked travelers at the airport other than the passengers en route to Hong Kong and Mainland China.
I put on one nonetheless in the spirit of solidarity. But others’ ammunition of protective equipment immediately put me to shame. Many donned surgical gloves, some in lab goggles and even plastic rain ponchos, disinfecting any surface their bodies touched. Drinking water with my mask dangling off one ear now felt transgressive, not to mention I broke a taboo by having in-flight meals.
More than impressed by people’s precautions, I was intrigued by the discrepancy in their access to masks. Paying exorbitant prices could secure the robust but scant N95 respirators. Most had the less expensive surgical masks, but even those became hard to find without connections to a supplier. A few wore the dubious varieties like the sponge mask, the washable cartoon cloth mask (I wore a Hello Kitty one to my elementary school during the 2002 SARS epidemic) and even DIY ones like a fashionable shawl.
Flights also became a microcosm of the disparity in protection: first-class cabin passengers were seated at a supposedly safe distance from one another, while the elbow-to-elbow economy travelers fretted the risk of flying amid an outbreak would outweigh the benefit of returning to what they perceived as a safer country.
Even getting a seat on the plane was a privilege. While airlines were suffering overall due to travel bans, demand could surge temporarily around major policy shifts. Following the W.H.O’s declaration that COVID-19 was a global pandemic, schools around the world moved classes online and shut dorms, prompting international students to go home. Flight tickets skyrocketed. Those who wanted to go home but couldn’t afford the price were stranded.
Week 7: Battling uncertainties

While our plane was traveling across the globe, my home city of Shenzhen announced expanded compulsory quarantine for arrivals from four to eight countries — adding the U.S. to the list — in an effort to contain imported cases as the epicenter of COVID-19 shifted overseas.
At 8 PM, the Shenzhen customs checkpoint resembled a hospital waiting room with a barely moving queue a few hundred meters long. Screenings were underway to detect coronavirus cases. The updated policy had not been officially announced, and many travelers were still expecting their family on the other side of the border. Impatience and confusion filled a hall that was lit by nauseating fluorescent lights. Will everyone be tested for the virus at the border or later at a quarantine base? Will foreigners receive the test for free? Will people have to pay for the quarantine?
Even the immigration staffers had few details. China’s containment measures were in flux just like the spread of the virus. The flood of inbound returnees was quickly squeezing the country’s medical resources and filling budget hotels repurposed as quarantine facilities. 
At 1 AM, I was finally called upon for a temperature check. I filled out a dozen forms asking similar questions about my travel history and health condition, each going to a different government agency. I wondered why, with China’s alleged technological prowess, this grunt work hadn’t been digitized or streamlined. Are resources for public monitoring going into other areas the government prioritizes?
I felt exhausted, but not more than the customs officer examining me, who had been toiling away for more than 12 hours. Despite having full-body protection, he was unaware his mask had slid beneath his nose.
“When do you get to go home?” I asked. “Who knows? There are so many of you coming back. China can’t afford another outbreak. We have no choice but to work,” he said nonchalantly.
Once my paperwork was sorted, I proceeded to cross the border. China immediately welcomed me with a text message, reminding me to register with the public security bureau as location data from my telecoms carrier showed I had recently been in “epidemic-stricken” America. The virus outbreak was giving Beijing more reason to monitor individuals. The question was why, given the government already commanded abundant citizen data, it seemed to have struggled in their early efforts to track people traveling from Wuhan.
As @thisboyuan reminds me, that the govt is scrambling to track peoples movement during the epidemic shows what Beijing has put in place for a national surveillance system still has considerable limitations

I was placed in a group of 20 travelers, most of whom were overseas Chinese students, to wait for the shuttle that would take us to the quarantine hotel. We bonded quickly by grumbling about the surreal eight-hour border crossing, but no one was actually angry. Instead, there was an outpouring of genuine gratitude for frontline health and immigration workers.
Famished, one of us volunteered to put everyone in a WeChat group so we could order food delivery together. The WeChat group, aptly named “3.14 Quarantine”, turned out to be useful for trading information and supporting each other through the erratic quarantine period. A street-sweeping truck was humming at a distance. The clock struck 4 AM as our bus pulled up in front of the hotel.

Week 8: Embracing chaos
Adjusting to the Chinese time zone became virtually impossible as my day confined to the hotel room was punctuated by a string of sporadic events: temperature checks, meal deliveries, nucleic acid tests, phone calls from various government agencies, and transfers to new quarantine locations. One night, we were given half an hour to pack up and got on a bus that took us to the edge of Shenzhen. There we underwent a virus-detecting test, only to be transported back eight hours later, at 3 a.m., to another hotel in the same area where we had previously stayed.
My quarantine peers were growing impatient with the unpredictable circumstances and began calling any relevant phone number they could find. As we shared in our WeChat group snippets of information we had collected from hotel staff, local officials, relatives and friends, something became clear: The quarantine system was the result of mass mobilization and complex coordination between public and private organizations, ranging from health workers and the Communist Party’s base-level administrative organ (called neighborhood committees) through to government-subsidized hotels and residential complexes.
When policymakers imposed frequent changes, the players implementing them on the ground often ended up scrambling, leading to miscommunication and such counterproductive measures as shuffling us around in crowded buses. They were briefed only on their part of the job rather than the entire process, which remained opaque, so getting close to policymaking power was critical. Calling a relative who worked in the disease control department was probably more useful than asking a hotel staffer. Personal ties seemed to matter even more in China when one sought control in times of uncertainty.
Some of us with insider information learned how to game the system. Before being dispatched to quarantine bases, we had to self-report our household address, for each district government was in charge of quarantining its own returning residents. The more deep-pocketed district normally provided higher-standard lodging and food, a piece of information precious to desperate individuals fighting for marginally better treatment.
I fall into the camp of people embracing chaos, as trying to stay informed and in control over continually updated guidance from above could quickly make me cross the line into anxiety.
There is already an abundance of self-care tips floating around, but having outrun the coronavirus twice, I could at least attest to their efficacy: Pare down your information sources to one or two trustworthy outlets; stay physically active; call people; keep a sense of humor; take deep breaths and perhaps spare some time for a mindfulness talk. It’s better to reserve grit for any long-term changes caused by COVID-19, which are looking increasingly likely.
On the afternoon of March 29, staff from my neighborhood committee came knocking on my door. Clad in blue hazmat suits, they gave me a final temperature check and granted me a piece of paper declaring my completion of the quarantine. I immediately put on a mask and went downstairs.
Things seemed intact at first glance, but a closer look revealed subtle but long-lasting changes since I had left two months prior.
Everyone was wearing a mask — even drivers alone in their cars. Premises had temperature checks and sanitizers at the entrances. Many small restaurants looked deserted; the ones back in business had more food deliverymen waiting about than people dining in. War-like propaganda posters dotted the street, reminding people that the battle against the plague wasn’t over. The world would never be quite the same."

Knowing who's legit and who's an opportunist can save lives.,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-dont-be-fooled-by-covid-19-carpetbaggers/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e87c9f7845a6c00080f0ed7/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/OpEd-COVID-19-Expert-1215356017.jpg",2020-04-05T16:00:00Z,"Last week, FiveThirtyEights Nate Silver teased his latest project on Covid-19 to his 3.2 million Twitter followers: Working on something where you can model the number of detected cases of a disease as a function of the number of actual cases and various assumptions about how/how many tests are conducted.
While his attempt at Twitter epidemiology was criticized mostly by academic scientists, it was hardly offensive enough to warrant anything more than an eyeroll. For all of the tweets ironySilver built his reputation by calling out the naivete of bad interpretations of polling datahis attempt was harmless, exploratory, and he didnt make any claim to being an expert.
C. Brandon Ogbunu (@big_data_kane) is an assistant professor at Brown University who specializes in computational biology and genetics.
That Silver appears to know his place as an outsider on the topic is more than can be said for thousands of people who have rewired their brands, credentials, industries, and research interests to become Covid-19 experts overnight. The growth curve of experts mirrors the exponential increase in Covid-19 cases, creating a multiverse of thousands of projections, models, ideas, recommendations, therapies, solutions, and scenarios. Much of it is ripe with dangerous misinformation, and threatens to worsen the pandemic.
There are many reasons for the big bang of Covid-19 expertise. Those wading into the pandemic forum include people who study related topics, or have expertise in some scientific domain. Pleuni Pennings, an evolutionary computational biologist and assistant professor at San Francisco State University, says many academics are initially responding to demands from personal and professional circles: Our students and friends and family members are coming to us for advice. For example, even though I work on HIV, early on, my non-science network came with many practical questions such as: Do you think I can still see my grandchildren?
For others, many of whom are not professional scientists, the motivation to participate comes from classical do-gooderism: People with resources, which include both skill sets and time, want to help in some way. And while the road to hell can be paved with good intentions, a world of overnight epidemiologists comprising only highly skilled, magnanimous polymaths would be tolerable (if still exhausting): It would be nice to know that all of these new experts were at least smart and caring.
Unfortunately, the majority of Covid-19 carpetbaggers are at the very least opportunists, and sometimes nefarious propagators of misinformation. They seize on the opportunity to use the topic that everyone is talking about to make a name for themselves, which is beneficial in whatever realm they operate in.
One story of a suspected Covid-19 opportunist involves Aaron Ginn, a Silicon Valley technologist whose five minutes of fame arrived in March after he wrote a contrarian essay proposing that evidence didnt support the hysteria over the consequences of the pandemic, that the problem might be sorta bad, but not really, really bad.
Ginn flaunted some unusual credentials in support of his authority on the matter: a talent for making products go viral. Im quite experienced at understanding virality, how things grow, and data, he wrote. The logic here would only be amusing if it wasnt potentially harmful.
Ginns story became a lightning rod for the expertise debate: After his piece was panned by critics (including one especially damning refutation by Carl Bergstrom, coauthor of the upcoming Calling Bullshit), it was removed by Medium, a decision that was criticized by The Wall Street Journal as an act of censure. The editorial is off-base, of course, as Ginns missteps were not simply a matter of a preference; poorly vetted ideas and misinformation are often propagated and promoted in digital spaces, which can influence behavior.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
While Silicon valley has been roundly criticized by the scientific community over this style of aggressive parachuting into Covid-19, tech bros arent the only ones guilty of opportunism. In fact, some of the worst offenders are academic scientists with strong (even stellar) reputations in their own fields who suffer from a serious case of covid FOMO.
One of the most high-profile examples of a well-regarded academic jumping the Covid-19 shark would be the rise and fall of Stephen Quake, armchair epidemiologist. Notably, Quake, is professor at Stanford and a superstar biophysicist by every professional metric. He doubles as co-president of the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, a $600 million collaborative research initiative, a role that amplified the influence of, and backlash to, his March 22 Medium essay How Bad is the Worst Case Coronavirus Scenario?
Based on the popular model developed by Neil Ferguson and colleagues, Quake compared the 500,000 possible Covid-19 cases to other major causes of death, and seemed to suggest that because a comparable number of Americans die of cancer, that the fuss around the number of potential Covid-19 deaths is unwarranted. Quakes argument reads like a Thanos-inspired All Lives Matter manifesto: People die a lot anyway, and this unusual way of dying will be solved in a short while, so what's the big deal? Quakes attempt at a I bet theyve never heard this provocation, was only successful in telling us that he is either a bad person, or didnt think very clearly about the problem (maybe both)."

Once the A100 is installed in Argonne, researchers there will “be able to screen 1 billion drugs in under 24 hours,” Kimberly Powell, Vice President of Healthcare at NVIDIA, told reporters in a briefing. Without the added computing power, researchers would need close to a year to screen the same number of therapeutics.
“This supercomputer is going to combine both accelerated computing and artificial intelligence,” Powell continued. “Critical applications in molecular dynamics simulation, where you can understand how molecules interact with drugs, how to interfere with the virus protein binds to the cell protein and how to block it with a molecule. And then how can we screen as many drugs as possible so we can more quickly get that drug candidate into experimentation and into clinical trials.” Up to 140 A100s can be run in parallel, pooling the combined power of their GPUs into a “DGX SuperPOD” that boasts more than 700 petaflops of processing capability. 
NVIDIA also announced a host of other new services it plans to roll out to hospitals across the country. Using its line of Clara Parabrick GPUs, NVIDIA has managed to reduce the time needed to analyze an entire human genome from around 30 hours to less than 20 minutes. The company is also teaming with more than a dozen industry partners and 50 hospitals around the globe to help better protect frontline medical staff through the use of remote monitoring, video conferencing and at-a-distance body temperature monitoring in a program called NVIDIA Clara Guardian."

After speaking with medical professionals, he believes that the issue isn’t COVID-19, but “organ failure through chronic hypoxia.” Essentially, a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream means that people’s bodies slowly suffocate to death over a period of days. 
The issue is often compounded by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), inflammation of the lungs, which makes breathing difficult. “Their lungs are compromised to the extent that, even with a ventilator on pure oxygen breathing for them, it’s impossible to get enough oxygen.” Reynolds believes that the solution isn’t more ventilation but to make breathing easier for patients in respiratory distress. And for a person with expertise in diving and diving equipment, the obvious answer is a hyperbaric chamber.
Hyperbaric chambers work by increasing the pressure outside the body, and they’re commonly used to treat breathing-related conditions. First, the lungs work less to breathe because the air pressure is so much greater that air forces itself in. Second, at higher pressures, oxygen is more soluble, so every breath gets more oxygen into the bloodstream. And higher levels of blood oxygenation, according to the Mayo Clinic, can “promote healing and fight infection.”
“Hyperbaric oxygen [therapy] is known to reduce inflammation,” said Dr. Reynolds, which could mitigate the effects of ARDS, too. Unfortunately, hyperbaric chambers are not common and are only used in very specific medical and diving-related scenarios. “There are not anywhere near enough hyperbaric chambers to cope with thousands of patients,” said Dr. Reynolds. Since it’s impractical to quickly mass-produce these chambers, Reynolds and his team started looking for alternatives.
Enter the grounded aircraft.
When a plane is in flight, it reaches heights where the air is very thin, and the air pressure is far weaker than at sea level. That means it’s doubly hard for a person to breathe at altitude, so planes are pressurized to near sea-level. Since planes aren’t in use, can already adjust their internal pressure and have oxygen routing capabilities, it’s plausible that they’d do the job. 
Reynolds suggests having a series of beds inside the cabin, with medical professionals in attendance, just like a normal ward. There would be a 90-minute cycle in which the cabin pressure would be increased to between 1.6 and 2 atmospheres. During this time, each patient would be breathing high-pressure oxygen through a mask in the hope of improving their condition. At the end of each 90-minute cycle, the plane would be depressurized and staff and equipment could move in and out as required.
Dr. Gerado Bosco is a professor at the University of Padua, specializing in hyperbaric therapy and biomechanics. He is one of a handful of researchers waiting for approval to begin testing hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. In trials, his team would expose patients to different pressures in 90-minute cycles and examine their response. The hope is that patients find it easier to breathe, their ARDS is mitigated and their immune response improves. 
He says that the plan to use grounded aircraft as hyperbaric treatment centers is “intriguing,” but that it’s far too early to comment. He does believe that, if the treatment is successful in trials, it may lead to a “tremendous decrease in ventilatory response.” 
The International Hyperbarics Association has published information relating to a study from Wuhan, China. According to the report, which we have not yet been able to confirm, Dr. Zhong Yangling, treated five COVID-19 patients, two in critical condition, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. All of them showed signs of hypoxia before the course started, and all five are said to have improved after the first two sessions. 
A study is being prepared in the US, and Dr. Bosco’s Italian study is working in partnership with a Canadian trial led by Dr. Rita Katznelson at Toronto General Hospital. The latter has started a JustGiving page to get funding for the trial -- and hopes to raise $250,000 (USD). 
As for the planes themselves, Technion University Aerospace researcher Neta Blum says it is possible to pressurize a cabin to up to 2.5atm if boosted by the pressure at sea level. She mentioned the one issue may be that repeated cycles of pressurizing and depressurizing the cabin could cause “fatigue cracks” in the plane’s fuselage. That may deter airlines from loaning their craft to the effort, especially if it renders them unusable in future. 
But nothing can, or should, be done until the science -- which, at present, is pretty flimsy -- is properly tested. If those studies show promise, however, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may prove to be a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19."

Just last week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said that only 45 percent of travelers asked intended to fly “within a few months of the pandemic subsiding.”
Perhaps the biggest casualty of COVID-19 so far has been the Airbus A380 and the flying it represented. This “superjumbo” jet, competition for the Boeing 747, was designed to offer mass transit in the skies, to convey huge volumes of people around the world in its double-decker cabin and a potential capacity of more than 850.
Work on the A380 began in the early ‘90s, with the first vessel entering service in 2007, and it’s instantly recognizable. Less a plane and more like a bus, it hauls people between major hub airports, where they get a single-aisle craft to their destination. The idea of air travel, back at the A380’s genesis, was that you’d fly to, say, JFK, and then get an A380 to Cape Town, Paris or Shanghai.
A number of carriers have A380s, but it’s become synonymous with Emirates, which has a staggering 115 of the craft in its fleet. But despite the plane’s relative youth, launching just over a decade ago, the virus has hastened the A380’s demise. Airbus announced last year it would stop manufacturing the plane, and according to Bloomberg, even Emirates, its biggest booster, no longer wants its remaining deliveries. 
Other carriers are also swinging the axe on their A380s, including Air France-KLM, which brought forward the “definitive end” of A380 operations by two years. In a statement, the airline said that doing so would make its fleet more competitive, with a “significantly reduced environmental footprint.” In its place would be smaller planes, like Airbus A350s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. 
Business Traveler said that Lufthansa is speeding up the phase-out of its own A380s, reducing its fleet of the superjumbo by half. Qantas, similarly, has said it will use smaller single-aisle planes on its long-haul routes until at least September — with eight of its 10 A380s grounded until then. 
From an airworthiness perspective, the A380’s retirement is premature — very premature. For comparison, a Boeing document from 2013 says the operational lifespan of its commercial aircraft is around 30 years. AerSale, a company offering aftermarket support for planes, says that “from purchase to retirement,” a plane should last “between 20 and 36 years.” If the A380 disappears from the skies by 2022, it will have lived — in total — for not even half of its potential lifespan. 
The problem with the A380 is that Airbus had banked on a “hub and spoke” model for international travel, but failed to spot the flaw in that plan. Taking a short hop to a hub airport and then on to another on the other side of the world will always add hours to a journey. It’s something that rival Boeing did pick up on. And it went in the opposite direction. 
Back in 2002, Boeing’s Peter Rumsey, then head of new airplane development, wrote that passengers “demonstrated a preference for flights that take less time.” He added that it was “common sense” to take people “where they want to go,” and what passengers wanted more than anything else was more direct flights.
At the time, Rumsey was hyping Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser concept, a new plane with a delta wing formation that would cruise at Mach 0.95 (around 729MPH). The Sonic Cruiser would fly higher than existing planes, with reduced turbulence and faster speeds. And, crucially, rather than trying to build a plane to cater for 800-plus passengers, Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser would transport between 200 and 250. 
The Sonic Cruiser project did not survive, with a post-9/11 slump causing interest in the project to dry up. But its original spirit, and some of the ideas, trickled down to Boeing’s next big, albeit far less radical, new aircraft: the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 is made of lightweight composite materials, has a higher internal pressure (for passenger comfort) and is far cheaper to run than similarly sized rivals.
The A380 had other problems, too. Its sheer size meant that airports had to make special alterations to their gates to accommodate such a plane. It also meant that it required larger crews and more engines, increasing the cost of each flight. One Forbes report said that every hour the A380 was in flight cost between $26,000 and $29,000. A Dreamliner, by comparison, costs closer to $11,000 an hour to fly.
Airlines will likely replace the A380 with smaller aircraft from Airbus and Boeing to reduce emissions and to deal with a drop in expected passenger numbers. What we won’t see, in the eyes of at least one aviation expert, is news of a next-generation airplane in the near future. 
Bill Blain is a market strategist at Shard Capital with a focus on the business of flying. He feels the aviation industry has badly misjudged the market. “It’s a right bloody mess,” he said, with both companies obsessing over making bigger, more capacious aircraft. Blain said that, while the Dreamliner is a “wonderful plane,” a better bet would have been a smaller plane.
He believes that airlines were always going to want planes closer to the 737 — a narrow-body plane with a capacity around 200 — than the bigger 747. “If you [as an airline] can get a small plane that you can make economical with 200 people on board,” then you’re golden. Blain said that Boeing’s failure to properly replace the 737 with a brand new aircraft has led to tragedy. The 737 Max, which modified the existing 737 design, led to two crashes that claimed 346 lives.
Airlines will need to pay for these early retirements, but Blain said they can’t simply raise ticket prices. The post-COVID economy is likely to be in recession or at least stricken enough that money is tight for everyone. “There’s not going to be the money available [in the economy] to hike airline prices, and airlines need bums on seats,” he said. 
What’s missing, however, is a next-generation advance that could really move the aviation market forward. Blain said the planes airlines will buy, like Airbus’ A320/321 and Boeing’s 737 Max, use “old tech” and aren’t very fuel efficient, both things airlines crave. He adds that both companies have neglected to invest in training new engineers to replace the experienced ones who are reaching retirement age. 
Airbus and Boeing declined to comment for this story, but both companies have new aircraft in the works. The latter is working on a “New Midsize Airplane,” which will reportedly seat between 220 and 270 passengers. However, Reuters reported in April that the program halted while the company scrambles to fix the 737 Max debacle.
Airbus’ next-generation craft could have been the hybrid-electric E-Fan X, co-developed with Rolls Royce. But that initiative died in April, a year before the aircraft was expected to take to the skies. The company is also working on a delta-wing concept, MAVERIC, with a bigger cabin but with a 20 percent reduction in fuel burn. But that won’t be ready for decades, if ever, and there’s still a need for aircraft that can ride the rough skies that COVID leaves behind."

When players arrive to Disney World’s “Life inside the Bubble” — tentative date July 30 — to restart the NBA basketball season, they’ll be met with a buffet of futuristic gadgets they can voluntarily use to prevent and detect the deadly coronavirus.
These gadgets include wearable proximity alarms that beep when you’ve been within six feet of someone too long, pulse oximeters, thermometers, and that hot $300 titanium smart ring everyone’s talking about, the Oura. The ring tracks and analyses data like sleep, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory function, and more. The NBA reportedly bought over 1,000 Oura rings for the season restart.
Players will also have plentiful at-will testing, too, making them the envy of most Americans.
Yet it’s Oura in all the headlines, the sci-fi wearable everyone suddenly wants. The ring’s hype in press is that it detects coronavirus symptoms up to three days in advance with 90 percent accuracy. That claim comes from a May press release basically promoting an app made by Oura, The West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI), and WVU Medicine. The app came out of a study between Oura and RNI about the ring’s potential to predict coronavirus among front-line healthcare workers. It’s a pretty cool idea, but my point is that it’s the app making the claim, and not necessarily the ring.
Oura, to its credit, has also been partnering with other teams at the forefront of COVID-19 research, like the USCF TemPredict study.
There are so many caveats here. For one, these studies are funded by the company selling the product. You could play buzzword bingo with every Oura press release until your eyes cross. Plus all the questions people like me have about Oura’s technical implementation and security implications (especially regarding Bluetooth), false positives, what Oura means by data sharing for in-app advertising, why they seemed to let their Android app languish, is it watching us masturbate like Ceiling Cat, and just how buggy is this magical wearable anyway? And, of course, what they think about making one for poor people. Because thanks to COVID-19, we’re going to have a lot more of those, too.
So we have questions. Lots of them. But we’re also really, truly in a life or death situation. So the deeper question is, are wearables finally getting to the point where they could detect COVID-19 symptoms before they appear (or provide a form of confirmation at the onset)?
Meet the biohacker who survived COVID-19
Biohacker Mikey Sklar had an unfortunate opportunity to find out for us when he contracted COVID-19 in the second week of March while using two fitness trackers: the Garmin Venu watch and Oura Ring.
“On the evening of March 16th, some anomalies started showing up even though I was not yet symptomatic,” Sklar wrote. “I would proceed to sweat through the night and wake up with a killer headache, terrible body aches, chills and a diminished sense of smell.” He then detailed some pretty obvious differences in his biometrics on the Garmin between his “normal” and “sick” states. 
His testing ordeal was intense, though Sklar told Engadget via email “Getting tested was more complicated at that time.”
If you use a sleep tracker like the Garmin or Oura, and you want to know what to look for regarding possible COVID-19 symptoms, Sklar noted his differences between “normal” and “sick” as: 
<ul><li>Resting Heart Rate increased by 15 BPM (lower is better)
</li><li>Heart Rate Variability decreased 30 BPM (higher is better)
</li><li>Average Overnight Body Temperature increased by 3.3 degrees fahrenheit
</li><li>Respiratory Rate increased by 2.7 breaths per minute
</li></ul>Sklar was one of the lucky ones. “My symptoms were limited and pretty much just being uncomfortable for a little over a week,” he wrote. Even so, he connected with developers of sleep app Bioloop, “who had been working with Stanford and Oura Ring data to find anomalies in a persons biometric history. They were looking for the same sort of jumps in biometrics I mentioned above RHR, HRV, body temperature and respiratory rate,” he added.
At the end of it all, Sklar concluded that “fitness trackers cannot tell us what we have,” but that they “can give us a little bit of warning when our bodies start fighting.” 
It’s a pretty even-handed take from someone who is really into hacking and tracking themselves. Some NBA players, on the other hand, are not cool with that at all. While using Oura rings is voluntary and the NBA is making data privacy promises to players, Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma tweeted, “Looks like a tracking device.”
A coronavirus panopticon (on your wrist)
Kuzma is right to be suspicious; he’s absolutely correct. Oura isn’t all that different than other sleep and wellness trackers, yet these devices gather and record a wealth of deeply personal data, they use security-problematic things like Bluetooth, anyone who knows what they’re doing can poke at the data to get more info like location, and companies get sold (as well as pressured by governments). 
From every technical perspective, something like the Oura represents an elite, thorough, and worryingly accurate tracking device bar none, terrifying if it were to be used for evil (or by Palantir, or Facebook for that matter). Moreso now that one country is taking coronavirus wearables in a very Orwellian direction — and that country is Singapore.
Not everyone in Singapore is using the country’s contact-tracing TraceTogether app. Use among the population never made it past 25% saturation, partly because not everyone has a smartphone, and largely because Singapore’s app doesn’t work on iPhones. That’s because TraceTogether breaks a serious security “best practice”, namely that Apple does not allow iPhone apps running in the background to access Bluetooth.
Singapore’s new solution to this mess of its own making is to release a wearable contact-tracing tracking device to its citizens and threaten to make it compulsory for the entire population to wear.
“Whether circumstances would ever require mandatory adoption we cannot say,” said Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative Minister-in-charge Vivian Balakrishnan on June 5th. “I am going to do my best to push participation rates up without having to go down the mandatory route.”
A petition was immediately created, with 52,000 signatures as of this week for “Singapore says ‘No’ to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing.” It explains how easily the device will be able to surveil citizens, and states:
The Government looks to the Covid-19 pandemic as the perfect excuse to realise what it has always envisioned for us – this country’s populace: to surveil us with impunity, to track us without any technological inhibitions, and maintain a form of movement monitoring on each of us at all times and places. And to do so by decreeing it compulsory for all law-abiding persons to become ‘recipients’.
We – as free, independent, and lawful members of the public of Singapore – condemn the device’s implementation as blatant infringements upon our rights to privacy, personal space, and freedom of movement. We reject the notion that the non-efficacy of the Trace Together initiative be superceded by a regime that could potentially require all members of the public (regardless of their age, susceptibility to disease, or health status) to give up these rights under fear – not of infection from Covid-19 – but of prosecution by the state.
The point of showing you all of this is not to scare you. We’ve had enough of that, and we should probably brace for more. It’s also tempting to think that I’ve taken you to these vistas of dark possibilities because I get off on terrifying readers, or desire a reputation for traumatically scaring my readers. I do not.
There is a lot going on and it is more than some people can take. If you use fitness trackers, hopefully Mikey Sklar’s experience can help you (he will also tell you what he did while surviving it, all you have to do is ask him).
But I’m also looking into the face of all this injustice, unfairness, greed, madness, and unnecessary heartbreak here on this page because, well, anger is a form of hope -- and we need as much of that as we can right now. As inconceivable as it is, the US has officially unflattened the curve, so terribly that the world is readying to quarantine us to our own soil. I think we can be forgiven for being angry, being scared, and for there being just an overwhelming sadness in everything we do.
I also think it is entirely appropriate to talk about why and how we DIY our way through this, whether it’s learning from fitness tracker hackers, demanding answers for people who can’t access these technologies because of inequalities tech startups refuse to acknowledge, or seeing the people of Singapore oppose invasive digital tracking and learning from it. We are no longer bewitched by shiny gadgets that offer convenience and connectivity. It’s time to make those gadgets work for us, instead."

It's 2020 and yes, full grown adults still need to hear it. 
Health officials in Washington confirmed the first death from the new coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, on Saturday. The virus is highly contagious, and as of Saturday, has infected 85,641 people worldwide and is responsible for 2,933 deaths. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
As panic around the virus rises, preventative supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer are becoming increasingly difficult to buy. They're out of stock in most drugstores and big box stores like Walmart and Target. On Amazon, brands like Purell and Germ-X are only available through third party sellers at high mark-ups. Frustratedshoppers on social media warned others of the hand sanitizer shortage, crowdsourcing lists of stores that still had an inventory. 
But hand sanitizer and face masks can only do so much compared to just washing your fucking hands. 
To prevent the spread of the novel virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and washing your hands. The CDC, in fact, ""does not recommend that people who are well"" even bother with wearing face masks as protection from respiratory diseases like the coronavirus.
While sanitizing with alcohol-based gels like Purell and Germ-X can reduce the number of microbes on your hands, they're not as effective as decent hand washing. The CDC says that hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol are effective to a degree, but people don't use enough for it to make most microbes inactive. Furthermore, studiesshow that hand sanitizer isn't as effective as hand washing to make germs like C-Diff and norovirus inactive. A 2008 study concluded that hand washing reduces respiratory illnesses by 21 percent. 
And besides, you should be washing your hands regularly regardless of whether or not we're facing a potentially devastating virus outbreak. It's just good practice, no matter what the state of global health is at the moment. 
Others on Twitter echoed a similar sentiment. 
just a friendly reminder you should also wash your hands when theres not a mass-hysteria virus panic

 Alex (@dirtbagboyfren) February 29, 2020
Despite emphasizing effective hand washing methods since childhood, Americans are still nasty. It's estimated that 95 percent of people don't wash their hands effectively, if at all, a 2013 study from Michigan State University concluded. The study found that 7 percent of women didn't wash their hands, and of those who did, 79 percent used soap. Another 15 percent of men didn't wash their hands at all, the study found, and only 50 percent of those who did used soap. 
That is disgusting. 
Hand washing shouldn't be and really isn't that hard. Singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice and gently scrubbing under warm, soapy water takes virtually no time and can prevent major disease spread. But it shouldn't take the threat of a potential pandemic to get adults to wash their hands after touching public doors or taking a dump. That should just be a societal expectation! This shouldn't be a public service announcement in the first place! 
Stop being nasty and just wash your hands."

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled us to experiment with edtech, but it’s still unclear whether attending school virtually with a laptop at the kitchen table offers the same benefits as being in a classroom. One recent study found that only 27% of schools asked teachers to monitor student attendance and 37% were required to do 1:1 check-ins on an ongoing basis.
Can education in a post-pandemic world become more accessible, asynchronous and persistent? Or will our digital divide deepen existing inequities in our educational system?
To consider the issue, four TechCrunch staffers looked at the future of edtech and remote learning:
<ul><li>Devin Coldewey</li><li>Natasha Mascarenhas</li><li>Alex Wilhelm</li><li>Danny Crichton</li></ul>When I was a kid, we played SimCity in computer class once we’d finished our typing lessons, five-paragraph essays and so on. I always thought I was pulling a fast one by zipping through the assignments and getting straight to building my city, but the truth is I was learning just as much with one as the other. The game fooled me into learning about city infrastructure, taxes and other civic concepts that I probably would have fallen asleep had I been reading about them.
As a preschool teacher I found myself on the other side of this phenomenon, finding ways to impart learning on my little charges without boring them and they were easily bored. It was always better to learn by doing, but kids don’t do anything unless it’s fun.
The pandemic isn’t just affecting higher education; 4th-graders and middle school kids are being thrown for a loop as well not to mention their teachers. Gaming has to be part of the solution.
Our education system has a sort of built-in fun-to-learning ratio that gets smaller as the years go on, because many of the tools we use to teach core concepts are dated and static. There are a few “edutainment” products if kids are lucky enough to have the iPads or laptops to use them on, but not enough, and they’re plainly of a lower order than the real games kids play all the time. When a kid’s hobby is playing something like Fortnite or Breath of the Wild, does an algebra worksheet dressed up like a 2002 Flash game really seem like anything more than work?
Educational games are stuck on the idea of adding fun to old methods of teaching instead of rethinking how learning can be accomplished outside of those methods. Yet the possibilities of teaching using remote presence and virtual worlds are staggering.
A simple and laudable example is Ubisoft’s educational mode, present in its last two Assassin’s Creed games set in ancient Egypt and classical Athens. For all that they came up short as AAA games, these astonishingly detailed sandboxes offer an entire college course’s worth of anthropology and history; in fact, a special non-violent mode exists just for exploring those aspects of the game.
Imagine telling a classroom full of 14-year-olds that their assignment was to play Assassin’s Creed for an hour a day, find something interesting, look it up and write a paragraph about it. Or build a functioning rocket in Kerbal Space Program. Or finish a set of puzzles in The Witness and list the hidden rules that govern them. Or work with three other kids to build a model of the school in Minecraft or Roblox .
Right now, that’s practically unthinkable (outside a few forward-thinking classrooms), partly because the culture around gaming is weird, toxic and few people take the medium seriously for educational purposes. But if remote learning is going to be part of K-12 education from now on and we’d better plan for that we need to meet kids where they are, not try to contort them into a mold cast a century ago.
It’s difficult to visualize because “real” games aren’t built for education except as a secondary consideration. But virtual worlds are becoming venues for more than competition, and embracing that from first principles, by involving educators and students to see what is needed and how those needs can be met, will be a fruitful path for the industry to pursue."

The ventilator, which has an acronym because this is NASA we’re talking about, is called ‘VITAL’ (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally) and its design is being offered for free, licensed use for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.

The design provides for use for between three or four months, however, rather than years for traditional hardware, and is meant specifically for COVID-19 patient use, hence its simpler design vs. models that are made to serve in a number of different medical situations.
NASA’s JPL is seeking commercial manufacturing partners for the hardware now that it has its authorization, however, in order to get it built in large numbers for distribution to hospitals in need.
This is one of a number of different emergency ventilator hardware design and development projects that have been spun up to address hardware needs in light of increased usage due to COVID-19. With NASA JPL’s pedigree, and its ability to serve in cases of most dire need, NASA’s definitely seems like one of the better engineered options out there."

TechCrunch spoke to Schwazze CEO Justin Dye following his company’s recent rebrand. He joined the company when it was Colorado’s Medicine Man Technologies (MMT) in late 2019 and is revamping the organization, including changing its name to Schwazze and acquiring a handful of companies to create a healthier, vertically integrated cannabis company.
The cannabis market is experiencing a correction after a period of rapid expansion. Shops are feeling the pain, and public valuations are settling under IPO levels and this was before a pandemic swept the world. Cannabis media outlet Leafly laid off 91 employees in late March, and Eaze, an early mover in on-demand pot delivery, is experiencing major trouble after raising serious cash and recently losing a top partner in Caliva. In several states, efforts are underway to prop up the cannabis market by asking for the federal government to allow these businesses to be eligible for federal financial relief.
According to Dye, there are several things CEOs of cannabis companies of every size should work toward. His advice echoes what TechCrunch has heard in other verticals, as well: During the COVID-19 crisis, cannabis companies must hunker down and lean on strong teams to weather the storm. Once the skies start to clear, capital will be available to the survivors.
One, the cannabis market is looking for financially sustainable companies, Dye said.
“This next reset in the cannabis industry will not only be aspirational, but it’s going to be coupled with a requirement for performance in terms of executing against a plan and driving profits or driving it to create free cash flow to be reinvested in the business and product experiences.”"

Rowe Price &amp; Associates, is laying off nearly 8% of its more than 1,800-member workforce today as it tries to reduce costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The layoffs will affect employees in Cruise’s product, marketing and rideshare business units, according to a memo sent by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann and viewed by TechCrunch. Bloomberg was the first to report the cuts.
Employees who are laid off will be offered severance and their healthcare benefits will be paid for by the company through the end of the year, according to the memo.
Cruise spokesman Milin Mehta confirmed the cuts.
“In this time of great change, were fortunate to have a crystal clear mission and billions in the bank. The actions we took today reflect us doubling down on our engineering work and engineering talent, Mehta, said in an emailed statement.
The layoffs are part of a broader strategy outlined in the memo to shift resources to where its needed most during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cruise is also closing its Pasadena, Calif. office, where it worked on lidar. The lidar team will be moved to the San Francisco office.
Even as layoffs occur, Cruise will continue hiring engineers, according to the memo.
The company will “continue to hire aggressively in the most critical areas within engineering, which right now means doubling down on senior leadership and senior IC roles to further support out improving core tech objective,” Ammann wrote in the memo. “From here we expect to recruit and grow across our engineering teams for the balance of the year.”"

The hub has already seen significant usage by those requesting food, supplies and information about local resources, as well as use by volunteers and groups willing to lend a hand. Now, Facebook is adding more features to the hub to allow people to support local businesses, blood banks, nonprofits, and more.
As part of Facebook’s efforts with GivingTuesday, it will roll out these new additions on May 5th, it says.
Typically, the GivingTuesday charitable giving event is held on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the U.S. — after Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales wrap. But in response to the unprecedented need caused by the pandemic, GivingTuesday announced an emergency day of giving, called Giving Tuesday Now. 
This new event happens tomorrow, May 5th, and already has a number of partners and supporters, including Facebook, as well as PayPal, America’s Food Fund, Ford, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, CDC Foundation, LinkedIn, United Way, GoFundMe, and many others.
Starting tomorrow, Facebook users will be able to go to Community Help at Facebook.com/covidsupport in order to buy gift cards to local businesses, sign up to donate to local nonprofits and fundraisers, sign up to be a donor at local blood banks, and find local job opportunities.
In some cases, Facebook already had built the technology and formed partnerships needed to launch these features. For example, Facebook began its work to connect Facebook users with blood banks back in 2017, then expanded the blood donations feature to the U.S. last June.
It also offers a fundraising platform of its own and announced last month it was working on tools that would allow businesses to offer gift cards to their customers via its platform. It’s been working on its jobs portal since 2018, too.
On Tuesday, these efforts are being centralized in the Community Help hub, which will give them increased visibility.
Facebook is not the only platform helping local businesses and nonprofits by rolling out new features.
Neighborhood social network Nextdoor also recently launched tools to allow businesses to promote their fundraisers and gift cards; Yelp just added a way for businesses to promote their virtual services; Instagram has introduced a range of tools for businesses, including those for connecting customers to Facebook’s gift cards or stickers for food ordering and more.
The revamped Community Help section will be live tomorrow, May 5, 2020."

The company reported revenues of $2.374 billion, down 2% on a year ago, with earnings per share of $0.64 on a GAAP basis and $0.77 non-GAAP, on a continuing operations basis.
This was a mixed result. Analysts on average were expecting $2.38 billion in revenues on earnings per share of $0.72. Ebay itself was expecting sales of between $2.31 billion and $2.36 billion with an EPS range of $0.72 to $0.75. In other words, eBay missed on sales in terms of analyst average projections, beat their expectations on EPS, and beat both of its own internal targets.
At the time of writing, eBay’s stock was down 7 cents in after-hours trading.
“During these unprecedented times, I am extremely proud of how our team has come together to support one another, our buyers and sellers, our communities and the business,” said Scott Schenkel, eBay’s interim CEO, in the earnings statement. “As we look at Q1, I am pleased that we delivered on all of our commitments for the quarter, with key metrics such as Buyers, GMV and Revenue performing at or better than our expectations. Over the past several months, we have remained focused and clear-eyed about the strategic direction of the company and have driven substantial changes to position the business for sustainable and profitable long-term growth.”
“I appreciate the team’s hard work in the first quarter and their efforts to maintain focus amid so many factors affecting the business and the industry,” said Jamie Iannone, the new permanent CEO that it headhunted from Walmart, in a separate statement. “I’m thrilled to return to eBay this week as CEO and I look forward to building on the positive momentum in the business, continuing to evolve the Company’s strategy and maximizing value for our shareholders.”
As expected, the company — like other e-commerce giants — has seen a boost in buyer demand from the throngs of consumers who are currently being ordered to stay at home, but who still need to buy things, and specifically try to source items that they’re finding a challenge to find in more local stores. eBay noted that active buyers are up by 2% and now total 174 million global active buyers.
Despite that, however, gross merchandise volume (GMV, or total sales volume before any cuts are taken) was $21.3 billion, down 1% on an as-reported basis. We might assume that the decline might have been significantly steeper without the current climate, or that it has at least offset other kinds of declines.
Within that, its Marketplace generated $2.1 billion of revenue, down 1%, while Classifieds saw $248 million of revenue, down 3%. That Classifieds business is on the block as part of the company’s wider efforts to restructure. “eBay continues to explore potential value-creating alternatives for its Classifieds business, is holding active discussions with multiple parties, and anticipates having an update by the middle of the year,” the company noted. 
There is a cloud hanging over many e-commerce businesses, even those that are seeing strong demand. The reason for this is that the economy is very shaky right now, and we don’t fully know what the coming months will hold, in terms of public health, government rules on how we can move, whether we will have jobs and money to spend. And all of that is playing into how companies like eBay will perform under its new CEO and continuing pressure from its activist investors.
With all that in mind, Ebay also updated its guidance for the next quarter and reiterated figures for the full year. Q2, it expects, will have revenues of between $2.38 billion and $2.48 billion, with GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.50 – $0.57 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.73 – $0.80.
The full-year figures are unchanged at between $9.56 billion and $9.76 billion, with GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $2.20 – $2.30 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $3.00 – $3.10.
“Given the dynamic environment, we are not revising our full year revenue and EPS estimates,” the company notes. “This guidance reflects management’s expectations for operational performance and the impacts seen in both of our Marketplaces and Classifieds platforms to date, but given the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict what may result as shelter-in-place guidelines are eased and lifted and how global consumer demand, the effects of COVID-19 on the general economy, seller inventory and advertising spending may evolve over time.”
More to come."

Samsungs results for the first-quarter of 2020 was in line with the guidance it released earlier this month. Operating profit was 6.45 trillion Korean won (about $5.3 billion). Revenue fell about 7.6% from the previous quarter to 55.33 trillion won, due to a seasonal drop in demand for displays and consumer electronics, and the impact of the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 3 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 217,000 deaths, and resulted in shelter-in-place orders in countries around the world and a global recession.
Samsung said that because the pandemics impact through the second half of 2020 remains uncertain, it plans to make flexible investments and adjust its product mix to adapt. Because it expects competition among manufacturers to increase as they try to recover from a weak first half, Samsung said it will continue to launch premium products like a new foldable and Note devices, and expand 5G to more mass-market smartphones.
Samsung’s display panel business saw a decline in earnings during the first quarter due to weak seasonality and lower sales in China during COVID-19 shutdowns, and it expects demand to continue being impacted by the pandemic and postponement of major sporting events like the Summer Olympics.
On the other hand, Samsung expects to see solid performance in its memory business as remote work, online education, online shopping and streaming entertainment services continue putting more demands on cloud providers and data centers. As a result, Samsung will speed up its transition to 1Z-nm DRAM and 6th-generation V-NAND flash memory.
Samsung also said it plans to offset store and plant closures around the world through flexible supply networks, improving its online sales capabilities, and tailoring promotions and logistics for different market."

Behemoths like Stripe and Square edged out banks while newbies like Brex nonchalantly raised nine-figure rounds. Today, however, the state of the financial technology industry feels more wobbly some healthy startups in the genre are faring better than ever, while others are feeling the strain as consumers tighten their wallets and change their spending patterns.
Its clear that were going to see some fintech startups struggle in the near future, but venture capitalists claim not to think in a short-term manner. We ran our last fintech VC survey in November 2019, so we wanted to get their take on where fintech is today. We turned to eight top VCs to better understand the state of the industry, which market signals they’re tracking and where opportunities still exist within the already-crowded pool of financial services:
Next week, well publish the other findings we received from these investors, focusing on fintech’s future in a post-COVID-19 world.
What follows is a collection of themes we noted from the investors, followed by their at-length responses.
Investing pace, flight to quality, varied impacts and uncertainty
Our first theme deals with investing pace. More investors than we expected were willing to note that their investing pace into fintech companies was slowing for one reason or another. While it’s become a cliché for private investors to state that they are open for business as a market signal, that doesn’t appear to mean that investments into fintech won’t slow.
The reasons why investors are slowing their pace of deals is varied, with some noting issues on their end (difficulty to reach conviction while operating remotely, etc.), and some detailing that some fintech companies are more internally focused today than reaching out to raise new capital. Investors also noted an expectation for fundraising to take longer and lower valuations. While that’s not great for founders, it’s also not the worst news; there is still money out there to be raised, and many investors claim they are writing checks of the same size as before.
The second theme deals with an expected flight to quality, with investors stressing that startups in the space should curtail spend that isn’t core to survival (marketing spend around branding was raised, for example), focus on key business metrics (unit economics, aggregate profitability), and monitor leading business indicators more closely. This is not a surprising set of advice, per se, but it is one that matters. If founders will listen remains to be seen, but investor are clearly signaling a return to more sober business operations.
Our third theme deals with how varied the impact of COVID-19 has been on fintech companies. As TechCrunch has reported, fintech companies have seen a distributed set of results since the pandemic closed much of the U.S. economy. However, when reading through investor responses, the true scale of this divergence became clear. The new reality is not merely that some fintech companies are doing a bit better or a bit worse. Instead, it’s that some are sharply down, some are flat, and some are soaring. This is perhaps a good argument for tightening what fintech means, or perhaps dealing with the category on a more tailored basis; fintech may have become too broad a bucket to treat as a group.
And finally, our fourth theme is uncertainty. Our investor group this morning isn’t expecting the economy to snap right back. But when it will return, and in what form, are far from clear. 2020 could be a lost year, said Brendan Dickinson from Canaan. The market recovery will not be swift, said Matt Harris of Bain Capital Ventures. And Charles Birnbaum from Bessemer Venture Partners said that “economic shocks” all “play out quite differently from one another.”
With that collection of notes, let’s begin. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.
Matt Harris, Bain Capital Ventures
What portion of your fintech portfolio companies is thriving? What portion is struggling?
Recently, weve started to look at our portfolio along two dimensions. The first dimension is the vulnerability of the company in general, considering things like cash balance and level of burn, fundraising needs and durability of revenue. The second dimension is the impact of COVID-19 on that company. Fortunately, a good portion of our portfolio fell into the positive end of both dimensions, and we were quick to focus our attention on companies with either high vulnerability or high COVID-19 impact.
Businesses that relied more on transactional revenue and exhibited urgent need for capital that couldnt be solved by cost-cutting measures are the most vulnerable, while businesses centered on consumer investing and spending, or those companies serving highly affected sectors like restaurants and travel tend to be most impacted."

Fact-check articles will begin appearing in relevant search results, using informations pulled from a dozen or so third-party publishers, including The Dispatch, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The site is leveraging ClaimReviews article tagging system, which is also used by Google Search/New, Bing and Facebook. 
In the post, YouTube specifically cites concerns around COVID-19-related misinformation as a driving force in the features expansion, noting the difficulty in keeping up with a rapidly changing news cycle. 
Our fact check information panels provide fresh context in these situations by highlighting relevant, the company writes, third-party fact-checked articles above search results for relevant queries, so that our viewers can make their own informed decision about claims made in the news.
The move doesnt directly involve the takedown of offending videos. Instead the plan is to offer users context as they search for information on a given subject. The feature will no doubt have mixed results, depending on how committed a user is to a given theory or source. People who are already dug in on notions of COVID-19 as a hoax are not likely to be swayed by contextual information from PolitiFact or the Washington Post. That’s just the nature of the post-information hellscape in which we all currently reside. 
It echoes a similar move from Facebook earlier this month, which alerts users when theyve interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus. Twitter, too, has expanded its own guidelines around coronavirus related tweets, removing some of the offending misinformation around theories involving things like 5G.
YouTube says the new feature “will take some time for our systems to fully ramp up.” That involves both refining the system, the features efficacy and eventually rolling it out into even more markets."

This is the second antibody study in a short span of time in California that suspects infections are far more widespread than previously thought, and a good justification for continued social distancing measures.
The LA County study does contain some good news, if the antibody testing proves to be accurate (we aren’t entirely sure what they show for sure at this point, especially in terms of immunity), in that the mortality rate of the infection is actually much lower than the official diagnosed case data would suggest. The infection rate found via antibody testing through the USC study is also remarkably close to the rate found in a Stanford study published last week about the number of infections in Santa Clara County, which found that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in that part of California could’ve had and recovered from the infection.
Whereas the LA study found around 2.8 to 5.6 parent had antibodies, accounting for the margin of error and extrapolating from results to the entire population, the Stanford research found between 2.5 and 4.2 percent of residents carry antibodies for the infection. Those numbers are based on the test kits’ performance, as well as the demographic makeup of the sample population tested.
Neither new research papers have yet been peer-reviewed, so it’s worth taking them with a grain of salt. But the close alignment between the numbers in both, along with early results from similar studies being conducted globally, does seem to suggest that the number of actual cases of COVID-19 far undershoots the published numbers, which typically only include confirmed diagnoses most of which represent individuals showing moderate to severe symptoms.
The higher rate of undetected infection definitely should not be taken as a sign that COVID-19 is less serious than it appeared, however; this new info only means that its transmission from people who showed no outward symptoms and never subsequently never sought any medical care or were identified for quarantine or contact tracing is probably a lot higher than anyone guessed.
That means social distancing measures are more important than ever, since it’s likely harder than ever to identify who might be a passive carrier of the virus that leads to COVID-19 without realizing it. Eventually, understanding the nature of the spread should help with refining measures to avoid the greatest potential risks of exposure, but for now, this new info just means that COVID-19 is much more effective at moving through a population without raising early warning signs than we previously understood."

Telemedicine wasnt generally listed as one of the primary applications for the companys first commercial product, but Boston Dynamics is only one in a long list of tech companies thats found itself shifting on the fly as the COVID-19 pandemic has become an all-consuming part of life. 
The company says hospitals have been reaching out since early March, asking if there might be a way to incorporate its technology to help with remote health. 
Based on the outreach we received as well as the global shortage of critical personal protective equipment (PPE), we have spent the past several weeks trying to better understand hospital requirements to develop a mobile robotics solution with our Spot robot, the company writes. The result is a legged robot that can be deployed to support frontline staff responding to the pandemic in ad-hoc environments such as triage tents and parking lots.
Fitted with an iPad and a two-way radio, Spot is being used as a mobile teleconferencing system, allowing doctors to check in on patients without risking the spread of the highly contagious virus. Its a fairly simple task and one that a number of robotics companies have actively cracked. 
While ultimately price-prohibitive for many healthcare facilities, Spots four-legged locomotion makes it possible for the robot to visit areas inaccessible for wheeled systems. The modularity always means it has the potential to accomplish further tasks. Boston Dynamics says it’s working on outfitting the robot with a system to detect vital signs like temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate and oxygen saturation. 
In the future, a UV light could also be mounted to the robots back to serve as a mobile disinfecting station."

The updated projects, which take into account the most recent information, show that with around a 30 percent decrease in social contact we could be nearing a national peak of new cases for now by the end of April but that if you decrease social contact by just 20 percent, the picture changes drastically, with a late peak that extends into mid-May and grows the number of new daily cases to as many as 30,000.
The Columbia projections are used to advise the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New York City and many other governments across the U.S. These updated projections also note that while we may hit a peak in the coming days, that also means that hospital and ICU capacity will be at their max in the same period. Again, Columbia researchers note, too, that this info doesn’t take into account local variances in when peaks arrive, and that some areas could have different peaks at different times even with a consistent 30 percent social contact reduction.
The model developed by the Columbia research team includes transmission and fatality numbers, movement by populations across city and state lines, and information like the capacity of emergency field hospitals, all info that was not available when the original modelling was done. You can take a look at the interactive graphs and daily estimates resulting from the model yourself here via Columbia’s website.
This is one of a number of recent updated projections from public health experts, epidemiologists and medical researchers that predict the impact of a relaxation of social distancing measures now could have disastrous consequences in terms of prolonging and worsening the spread of COVID-19, and also on taxing healthcare resources (not to mention frontline workers).
MIT also projected a similar impact from the relaxation of measures currently in place, predicting an “exponential explosion” would result. Meanwhile, some states are already implementing such restriction relaxations, despite consensus from informed experts and researchers indicating it’s too early to begin such rollbacks."

“We want a good solution for a resource-limited environment,” says ChromaCode founder and executive chairman Alex Wilkinson, a serial entrepreneur who has worked with CalTech researchers spinning out companies since the early 2000s.
The technology was based on research conducted by California Institute of Technology graduate student Aditya Rajagopal. A former researcher at Google[x] working on novel medical imaging methods, Rajagopal is the inventor of HDPCR, the tech at the heart of ChromaCode’s product.
With the help of Wilkinson, Rajagopal spun out the technology he’d developed to form ChromaCode in 2012, according to Crunchbase, and raised its initial capital to develop a diagnostic tool that could use algorithms and new sensing technologies to increase the number of targets that can be analyzed by traditional PCR analysis.
The polymerase chain reaction tests were invented in 1985 by Kary Mullis, who was working as a chemist at the Cetus Corp., and use copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences that are amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes. It’s one of the foundations of genetic analysis. 
While traditional PCR testing relies on differentiation of targets by color, the HDPCR technology developed by ChromaCode’s co-founder uses signal intensity to identify multiple different targets and signify them as curve signatures encoded into a single color channel. Think of the technology as using color gradients to identify multiple targets in a test instead of just one color.
“It’s like image compression,” Wilkinson said.
For COVID-19 specifically, the use of ChromaCode’s technology could expand available testing capacity threefold, the company said.
“Right now the basic test looks at three different things,” said Wilkinson. “These machines have wells and they can do 96 tests at a time. The challenge is that you would typically use three of those wells for each test. We let them do all of the test in one well, which would give you a three times multiple.”
That means instead of testing 32 individuals using existing PCR equipment, labs would be able to perform 96 tests at a time.
Even more significant is the ability for ChromaCode’s technology to identify other illnesses alongside COVID-19. “What we’re planning for is the fall when we will be taking the existing COVID test and layering in flu and other diseases,” says Wilkinson.
The ability to test for multiple pathogens has important implications for the ability to adequately test, track and trace the spread of the disease in the low and medium income countries that are now undergoing their own outbreaks. “The problem in Africa is that someone has a fever and it might be COVID or that might be Dengue fever,” said Wilkinson. Using ChromaCode’s technology, diagnosticians and physicians can tell the difference without having to use new machines.
It’s the ability to work on existing technology that sets ChromaCode apart from competitors like BioFire Diagnostics and Cepheid, according to Wilkinson and his co-founder Greg Gosch.
“The supply chain on the tests will continue to be strained so people will be looking for more efficient mechanisms,” said Gosch. 
Adjuvant Capital, the investment fund spun out from a collaboration between the Gates Foundation and JP Morgan Chase, had already identified ChromaCode as a potential investment target well before the pandemic hit, according to managing partner Jenny Yip.
The investment firm began speaking with ChromaCode in the summer of 2019, and was drawn to the company for its ability to expand testing capacity well before the COVID-19 outbreak brought the problems of adequate testing into stark relief.
“From a global health perspective, ChromaCode’s technology ability to be installed in the existing technology base is very powerful,” said Yip. Given the low resource base in some of the countries where testing is needed the most, requiring the installation of an entirely new suite of hardware and software tools is untenable — let alone developing a supply chain that can service and maintain the technology.  
The lack of adequate testing in the United States remains the biggest obstacle to safely fully re-starting the country’s economy and ensuring that any future outbreaks of the disease can be managed successfully, according to experts.
Testing is your first fundamental step in a plan to keep infected people from susceptible people, Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told The Atlantic.
Theres a strong sense that the White House knows the amount of testing we need is far more than we have right now, he said. It is really stunning and disappointing."

Everlywell then became intent on working with the FDA to secure a proper Emergency Use Authorization for its kits before sending any to consumers, and that approach has paid off with the U.S. drug regulator issuing an EUA for Everywell’s tech today.
Everywell‘s COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit is the first standalone sample collection kit to be granted a proper EUA by the FDA. Other kits have been in use through physician-prescribed and directed collection, and others still have been authorized specifically for use with one test (where provider of both kit and test are the same). This approval is unique because Everlywell is offering its sample kit independent of any specific testing lab, and can work with a variety of labs to potentially provide a broader testing footprint.
The test kits are then sent to one of two labs currently authorized under separate EUAs for COVID-19 testing, and the administration notes that this could expand to other test providers in future should they file for an EUA and provide the requisite data that goes along with the verification required for that emergency approval. The FDA cites Everlywell’s work in collecting and presenting data from studies including those supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to show that samples collected at home using its nasal swab collection method remain stable during shipping.
That data is also now available to others looking to provide similar test kit offerings, the FDA notes, which should reduce the burden of proof on anyone looking to gain authorization for a competing product. That could potentially open up testing even further, reducing a bottleneck that many public health professionals see as one of the key drivers of a successful recovery.
The authorization of a COVID-19 at-home collection kit that can be used with multiple tests at multiple labs not only provides increased patient access to tests, but also protects others from potential exposure, said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health in a statement provided to TechCrunch . Todays action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic."

Vice is hardly alone, of course. Even as more people have their eyes glued to computer screens and news reports, revenue has declined during the COVID-19 crisis. Reporting on itself, The New York Times noted its own revenue struggles, even as digital subscriptions have climbed, 
In keeping with a trend that has affected other news organizations during the pandemic, The Times attracted new readers while the money it brought in from advertising plummeted. Overall ad revenue fell more than 15 percent, to $106.1 million, in the quarter. Digital ad revenue declined 7.9 percent, while print ad revenue had a drop of 20.9 percent.
Its a familiar and frustrating refrain across the board. Even with readership up for some, companies simply arent spending on ads during the pandemic. Times likes these, the ad revenue model feels like a precarious house of cards on top of which media empires have been built. Buzzfeed, Vox and Bustle have all announced either layoffs, pay cuts or employee furloughs in recent weeks, leaving many to ponder at the future of the already precarious world of digital media.
Its true that publications suffer every time a slight gust of wind upsets the state of the economy, but the COVID-19 recession feels different in virtually every way. In addition to the 36 million Americans who have filed unemployment since the start of the crisis, the pandemic has had extraordinarily far reaching impacts on ever aspect of the economy. Not even ad giants like Facebook and Google are immune from the effects. A report from late March noted that the internet giants could see a combined loss of $44 billion in ad revenue before years end. 
Digital media has felt like a precarious industry for some time. The effects of economic recessions and feelings of distrust against media sowed by the White House have made the last few years particularly difficult. The addition of the unprecedented uncertainty of COVID-19 is adding rocket fuel to that fire. 
Weve reached out to Vice for comment."

Grab, Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailing company, has also been impacted, but the company has adapted by quickly transitioning many of its ride-hailing drivers to its on-demand delivery verticals and expanding services needed by customers during social distancing measures.
The company told TechCrunch that its ride-hailing drivers saw their incomes decrease by about a double-digit percentage in April 2020, compared to October 2019, in line with a double-digit drop in gross merchandise volume for Grabs ride-hailing business in some markets. Between March and April, more than 149,000 Grab ride-hailing drivers switched to performing on-demand deliveries. In some markets, the transition was done very quickly. For example, in Malaysia, 18,000 drivers moved to delivery in a single day. The platform also saw an influx of new driver requests, many from people who had been laid off or furloughed, as well as merchants who needed a new way to make income.
Russell Cohen, Grab’s regional head of operations, told Extra Crunch that to redeploy driver capacity to delivery verticals, the company worked with governments in its eight markets to understand how different COVID-19 responses, including stay-at-home orders, affected on-demand logistics. Anticipating shifts in consumer behavior, it also started adding new services that will continue after the pandemic.
Grab currently has about nine million “micro-entrepreneurs,” or what it calls the drivers, delivery, merchants and agents on its platform. Cohen says the company began to see an effect on ride-hailing and transportation patterns in January and February as flights out of China, and air travel in general, began to decrease. Then COVID-19 started to have a material impact on its ride-hailing business in March, with a sharp drop after countries began implementing stay-at-home orders."

— Zach Rael (@KOCOZach) May 24, 2020
As a spokesperson from the company noted in a message to TechCrunch, the nature of such a PR pitch isnt out of the ordinary. Companies upload stuff to PR wires all of the time, in hopes of having their story told their way on local news outlets. Amazon suggests that sending out such a neatly wrapped package can give stations access to their fulfillment centers in a time when many arent traveling outside of the studio. 
We welcome reporters into our buildings and its misleading to suggest otherwise, the company says in a statement. This type of video was created to share an inside look into the health and safety measures weve rolled out in our buildings and was intended for reporters who for a variety of reasons werent able to come tour one of our sites themselves.
Whats notable here, however, is how many stations more or less went with the straight script on this one. At least 11 appear to have followed suit. The below video from Courier edits the stories together into a handy package: 
Millions of Americans staying at home are relying on Amazon to deliver essentials like groceries and cleaning products during the COVID-19 outbreak, the script opens. For the first time, we’re getting a glimpse inside amazon’s fulfillment centers to see just how the company is keeping its employees safe and healthy…while still delivering packages to your doorstep.
Tell me more.
Obviously gathering one’s own video is ideal, so as to avoid as much corporate influence as possible over a story — especially one with important consequences such as this. Still, it’s not unusual for local stations to rely on footage from companies for those places they’re otherwise unable to access. That seems to go double these days, when media resources can be inadequate for local stations. Keeping such a close read of material created for the sole purpose of placing a corporation in a good light, however, is more problematic when it comes to attempts at unbiased reporting.
Amazon’s handling of the pandemic among its “essential” workforce has come under fire of late. In addition to the firing of several workers who have voiced public criticism about the companys policies, lawmakers have demanded the company be more transparent about the rate of infections and deaths among employees. Amazon still has not disclosed those figures, in spite of requests from attorneys general and Senators, but has continued to insist that its rates of infection are at or below the rates of the communities where we operate."

This month, the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded a new $5 million contract to Palantir through veteran-owned software reseller i3 Federal LLC, which lists Palantir as a partner. The contract, set to run through November, will provide the VA with Palantir’s Gotham software to “track and analyze COVID-19 outbreak areas and make timely decisions with insight into supply chain capacity, hospital inventory, social service utilization and lab diagnostics.”
Palantir’s Gotham tool, best known for its use by law enforcement agencies, is one of the company’s main products and collects disparate data streams onto one platform. Twitter user Jack Poulson first spotted the contract, which was later reported by FedScoop.
A smaller contract also listed this month awards Palantir $2 million to provide the National Institutes of Health within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) a”COVID-19 dataset aggregation proof of concept.”
Palantir moved early to provide its services to governments grappling with the threat of the coronavirus and by mid-March was already working with the CDC to model infection patterns and anticipate hospital equipment needs.
In April, HHS awarded two contracts worth nearly $25 million to the company for software for a software platform called HHS Protect Now, intended to inform public health decisions made by the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force. HHS didn’t solicit competition for those contracts, noting that the COVID-19 crisis created a situation of “unusual and compelling urgency.”"

Edwards is set to launch this fall, and claims to be able to provide a nearly 100 percent reduction in the particles present in exhaled air thus reducing the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 both into, and out of, the lungs while breathing. That could mean a significantly reduced risk of contracting COVID-19, particularly for frontline healthcare workers when used in combination with other PPE like face masks.
The product, called FEND, and produced by Edwards’ tech startup Sensory Cloud, is set to be available from September. It’s a saline mixture (essentially a “salty mist”) that contains no drugs, and is instead directed from naturally-occurring salts that are most often found in sea water. The mist, when delivered via deep nasal inhalation in misted form, has been shown in peer-reviewed research published on Tuesday by Sensory Cloud in medical journal QRB Discovery to clean upper human airways of particles that are less than a micron in size that aren’t typically filtered out by most conventional mask designs.
The study conducted by the company is based on a small-scale sample population of 10 volunteers, including five who are above 65, and five who are below that age, so it’s worth taking that into account when considering the results. Still, cross the sample group, the researchers found that it reduced transmitted particles per liter of air by around 99 percent with most of those particles blocked being ones that would’ve been too small to be filtered by conventional masks.
Sensory Cloud contends that FEND could provide “anyone at risk of SARS-CoV-2” with additional protection in terms of scrubbing the airways of both inhaled particles for those who don’t yet have the virus, and also for preventing the expulsion of viral particles for those that do. Accordingly, while the company plans to launch it to get general public through its online sales platform, it is also “committing to facilitating access” of FEND once it becomes available to “needy at-risk populations” including frontline workers around the world. Sensory Cloud is also debuting a number of clinical trials this summer, the results of which should go a long way in terms of supporting their early small-scale study results, if positive.
The startup plans to price Fend, including the mister delivery device, at $49 for a two-pack with individual refill bottles priced at $6 each afterwards, with each refill providing around 250 total uses (each use provides the cleaning benefits described above for roughly 6 hours based on the company’s research)."

French German, Spanish and English news sites see far less social engagement than these foreign-originated ones in their languages.
The study is part of ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 disinformation campaigns by the Computational Propaganda Project. The group found that major outlets like Le Monde, Der Spiegel, and El Pais are being outshared four or five to one in some metrics by content from Russia Today, China Radio International, and other state-backed organizations.
Earlier reports focused on English-language sharing of this type of media, which can be generally described as act-adjacent with a strong emphasis on certain narratives. The repeated finding was that although mainstream news outlets have an overall stronger presence, state-backed and junk news is way ahead in engagement per post or article. In the latest report it is shown that on average, mainstream articles collect about 25 engagements per post, while state-backed items get 125. When multiplied by millions of users and followers, that becomes an enormous discrepancy.
There is more nuance to the data than that, of course, but it gives a general idea of what’s happening: disinformation is being spread widely, whether by bots or organic reach, while ordinary news sources only reach a similar amount of people through more output and wider initial reach. It wasn’t, however, clear whether this was the case outside English-language media.
It certainly seems to be, according to data collected over three weeks from a variety of news sources. Mainstream media had a larger overall reach but state-backed media often produced far higher engagement per article. This is perhaps explained by the fact that the state-backed organizations tended to pursue and push controversies and divisive narratives. As the study puts it:
<ul><li>Russian outlets working in French and German consistently emphasized weak democratic institutions and civil disorder in Europe, but offered different kinds of conspiracy theories about the pandemic;</li><li>Chinese and Turkish outlets working in Spanish promoted their own countries global leadership in combating the pandemic, while Russian and Iranian outlets generated polarizing content targeted at Latin America and Spanish-speaking social media users in the United States.</li></ul>
That sort of clickbait spreads like wildfire on social media, of course, and few of those who thoughtlessly hit that share button will have the inclination to check whether the source is a government-backed news agency plainly attempting to sow discord.
On the other hand, it seems as if some consider turnabout fair play. For example: a Chinese state-backed news countering the flourishing U.S. conspiracy theory that the virus is a Chinese bioweapon with a counter-theory that it is a U.S. bioweapon released in and blamed on China.
“Many of these state-backed outlets blend reputable, fact-based reporting about the coronavirus with misleading or false information, which can lead to greater uncertainty among public audiences trying to make sense of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Oxford’s Katarian Rebello in a news release.
The countries and state-backed outlets mentioned also have a major presence in Arabic language markets and the researchers are working on a follow-up study inclusive of those."

Space Capital’s Q2 report did report an 85% decline quarter-over-quarter vs. Q1 in terms of infrastructure investment, which is a clear sign that investors have been wary of spending on big, expensive new companies actually building and launching space hardware. We saw the result of some of that retraction with mergers and bankruptcies, including the high-profile bankruptcy and subsequent sale of satellite constellation operator OneWb.
The good news on the software layer is that the quarter saw $5.3 billion invested in these companies, including $4.5 billion in the U.S., according to the report. And VC funding overall is actually up 4% year-over-year for H1 2020 vs. H1 2019, the firm notes though Q2 investment taken on its own is down 23% year-over-year relative to Q2 2019.
On the whole, the space sector saw $12.1 billion in equity-based investments to date in 2020, across 112 rounds, with early stage investments totalling $303 million of that, across 67 rounds. The bulk of those were either Seed or Series A investments.
It’s worth noting that the Applications layer as tracked by Space Capital includes essentially any company that relies heavily on GPS - and PNT-based navigation for their software, including large companies like Waymo that need that data to make their self-driving technology work.
GPS is unquestionably one of the largest and most successful space-based infrastructure investments that continues to bear considerable fruit, in terms of new businesses being built, and legacy industries continuing to be updated and disrupted.

Both early trials showed efficacy in increasing the presence of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to COVID-19, and also indicated that these prospective vaccines were safe to administer based on available information.
The University of Oxford study is one of the leading vaccine development efforts in the world, and among those that are furthest along in development. The results of their study covered 1,077 participants, all of whom were health adults aged between 18 and 55 with no prior confirmed history of having contracted SARS-CoV-2. That’s important because they received double randomized trials of the vaccine candidate, or an existing vaccine for meningitis as a control acting as a placebo. The results showed that across the group, 100 percent of the participants had demonstrated neutralizing antibody responses by the end of the course, which include a booster does.
Additionally, while some participants exhibited side effects, including “pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache and malaise,” none of these represented what the researchers consider series reactions, and these were also mitigated with use of paracetamol (standard painkillers available over the counter). Patient reactions were monitored for 28 days following the administration of the vaccine.
Oxford’s team is now ready to move on to its Phase 3 trial, which is a large-scale human trial that is effectively the last major step before it moves on to potential approval, production and distribution. That’s a time consuming process, but it does put this development on pace for a remarkably fast research and development process relative to prior vaccines.
Meanwhile the study in China covered health adults 18 or older, and included 603 participants, screened down to 508 who received either the vaccine candidate or a placebo. The participants also showed no adverse reactions, according to the researchers, and they’re also now likely to move on to a phase 3 development program.
Earlier this month, Moderna also announced promising early results from its phase 1 trial, but that was limited to just 45 participants between 18 and 55, and indicated some potentially serious side effects that will need to be watched in later, larger trials. These new results, while also early and requiring further development and research, are much more encouraging given the scale of both trials.
It is very early to make too many assumptions about what these early trials indicate, however. For instance, we still don’t really know how effective antibodies are in patients that have recovered from having COVID-19 once, so a lot more investigation is required by scientists in better understanding the efficacy of antibodies, and potentially vaccines, over the long term."

In partnership with regional news publications in select cities across the U.S., the Google News app will now offer a dedicated section in select markets detailing critical information like community reopening timelines, business updates, school openings, as well as information on the local healthcare infrastructure, public transportation, events, and ways to help families in need.
At launch, the new feature is available for readers in Raleigh, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette, Columbus, Portland, Cleveland, Myrtle Beach, Albany, Sarasota, Cap Girardeau, Richmond, Memphis, Cincinnati, Boston, New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis.
To access the newly added local information, app users will click on the COVID-19 banner which directs them to the existing section focused on coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. They will then scroll down to find the new “Local news” section directly underneath the “Top News” section.
This new section won’t be shown if the user’s city or town isn’t yet covered. However, you can force the section to display by selecting one of the supported cities and making that your city in the Google News app.

To deliver this local information, Google is working in partnership with 21 news organizations for the supported markets, including Raleigh’s The News &amp; Observer, NOLA.com, CBS Chicago, Oregon Live and Gothamist, among others. The news organizations must already provide this COVID-19 information in the form of short-form content. For example, this page from The News &amp; Observer offers a brief list of updates as bullet points which Google can easily re-publish to the Local News section of the Google News app.
The app will still allow users to click through to the local publication to read more.
Google tells us that all publishers will have to offer news a similar format to be included for the time being. In other words, Google isn’t automatically creating short-form summaries from news articles to fill this section.
The local COVID-19 news feature is currently in pilot testing, but Google plans to expand coverage across the U.S. and Canada in the future. It also plans to offer the feature outside of the Google News mobile app itself.
To some extent, the addition is a way for Google to offer its own version of Facebook’s “Community Help” feature, which the social network expanded in March due to the COVID-19 crisis. Facebook’s hub today offers a way for users to get information about how the coronavirus outbreak is impacting their own local region and what they can do to help. Google’s feature also arrives at a time when Flipboard has splashed back onto the scene with its new focus on local coverage, including coronavirus updates.
And of course there’s Google News app’s direct rival, the Apple News app. Apple News has also added its own take on local coverage with a “City Guides” section in its own COVID-19 special coverage area. These city guides focus on providing essential knowledge about testing, resources, jobs, and more for larger U.S. metros.
In addition to the update to the Google News app, Google says it’s recently expanded access to local news on Search and Google Assistant, as well.
Now when people search for coronavirus information on Google Search, they’ll see both a top stories carousel as well as a new dedicated local news carousel. Google also expanded its new carousel highlighting top tweets from local and health authorities in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, users can ask Google Assistant for local coronavirus news by saying something like “Hey Google, play news about coronavirus in Boston,” in select markets.
Google has also financially contributed to local news organizations itself in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, having recently provided emerging funding for over 5,300 local news organizations around the world, ranging from $5,000 – $30,000. The company said it expects to spend “tens of millions” through this Journalism Emergency Relief Fund. Plus, Google recently launched a Support Local News campaign to encourage people and businesses to subscribe, donate and advertise across local news outlets in the U.S. and Canada."

The 11-count indictment, unsealed Tuesday, alleges Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, stole terabytes of data from high-technology companies, around the world including the United States, the prosecutors said.
More recently, the prosecutors accused the hackers of targeting the networks of over a dozen U.S. companies in Maryland, Massachusetts and California developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.
The indictment comes just weeks after both the FBI and Homeland Security warned that China was actively trying to steal U.S. research data related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The hackers were first discovered after they targeted a U.S. Department of Energy network in Hanford, Washington, the Justice Department said. The hackers also targeted companies in Australia, South Korea, and several European nations. The hackers used known but unpatched vulnerabilities in widely-used web server software to break into their victims’ networks. By gaining a foothold onto the network, the hackers installed password-stealing software to gain deeper access to their systems. The prosecutors said that the hackers would “frequently” return to the networks in some cases years later.
According to the indictment, the hackers stole “hundreds of millions of dollars” worth of trade secrets and intellectual property. The prosecutors also allege that the hackers stole data related to military satellite programs, military wireless networks, and high-powered microwave and laser systems from defense contractors.
The hackers are said to have targeted their victims on behalf of China’s intelligence services, but also hacked personal financial gain. Prosecutors said in one case, the hackers “sought to extort cryptocurrency” from a victim company by threatening to publish the victim’s stolen source code online.
John C. Demers, U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, said that the indictments were “concrete examples” of how China used hackers to “rob, replicate, and replace non-Chinese companies in the global marketplace.
Demers also accused China of providing a safe-haven for the hackers.
China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being on call to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist partys insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,” said Demers.
If prosecuted, the hackers could each face more than 40 years in prison. But since the hackers are believed to still be in China, any extraditions to the U.S. are unlikely."

The Palo Alto-based VC firm is banking on the future with investments in capital-intensive and technically complex pursuits, including robotics, autonomous driving, metallic 3D printing and infrastructure. It’s an investment strategy that isn’t for the faint of heart.
So, how does a firm that embraces futurism handle the present-day disruption of COVID-19? It looks ahead, of course.
When co-founder and CTO Peter Barrett joined TechCrunch this week for an Extra Crunch Live panel, the pandemic dominated the conversation. The executive noted that a new and common thread has emerged throughout the many discussions among Playground executives and the startups in which it has invested.
Priorities are shifting toward finding ways to be of service.
Everything feels different these days. Recent months have caused many in Silicon Valley to reconsider their investment priorities, roll up their figurative sleeves and begin the process of helping the world survive and, eventually, recover from the seemingly endless COVID-19 pandemic. Like many others, Playground finds itself at a crossroads determining how it can be of service, while examining the ways in which a crisis like this can be addressed.
One thing that underscores this pandemic is a realization that we need to be doing other things if we want to avoid being stuck inside for six months to a year, Barrett said. The biggest trend is a recognition that we need to make the investments that give us agency over our biology, and to build the tooling and infrastructure, so the parade of maladies which is behind COVID won’t have the same consequences that COVID-19 has.
The pandemic has also driven people to reflect on what they want to do with their lives, Barrett said, suggesting that this phenomenon could influence which startups emerge from this period as well as what venture capitalists choose to invest in.
If you’re an entrepreneur, I think a dating app looks less appealing than contributing in some way, Barrett said, adding that entrepreneurs are looking at areas that put us in a position where we really don’t have to be stuck inside because of a certain kilobase virus.
Playground has a number of startups that are in position to offer some support, though, as is the nature of the firms tendency toward long runways. Most, however, appear better positioned to consider how we can prepare ourselves for the inevitability of some future pandemic, rather than the one we’re currently battling.

After spotting Cignarella across an air shaft, Cohen used drones, Venmo, texting and FaceTime to interact with his socially distanced crush. But it was on their second date when Cohen pulled out all the stops. He purchased a gigantic plastic bubble, sealed himself inside and invited his new friend to go on a touchless walk. As Cohen wrote on Instagram, just because we have to social distance doesnt mean we have to be socially distant.
Cohens quirky, DIY approach made for fun clickbait for a few days. But its also a somewhat unflattering metaphor for the kinds of touch-centric entrepreneurialism that has proliferated in the age of COVID-19. From dating to banking, education to retail, the virus has pushed everyone to rethink how touch and proximity factor into daily interactions. Businesses besieged by the uncertainty of shutdown orders, partial re-openings, remote work, disease spikes and changing consumer behavior have been forced to test-drive solutions on the fly.
Amid that confusion, a few common approaches have emerged. Some are rushing to return to normalcy, adopting quick fixes at the expense of more broad-based solutions. Others are using the pandemic as an excuse to accelerate technological shifts, even those that may be unwelcome, impractical or both. Still others are enforcing guidelines selectively or not at all, tempting consumers back, in part, through the promise of normal (read: non-distanced and non-regulated) interactions.
Enter haptics. Investment in touch technologies had been on the rise before COVID-19, with virtual reality fueling fresh interest in haptic gloves and full-body suits, and haptics for mobile devices like wearables and smartwatches infusing the field with new resources. While it is difficult to capture the health and growth of the haptics industry with a single number, one estimate puts the global haptics market at US$12.9 billion in 2020, projected to grow to US$40.9 billion by 2027.
In addition to established players like Immersion Corporation, founded in 1993 and active working on haptics applications ranging from gaming and automotive to medical, mobile and industrial, Sony, Apple, Microsoft, Disney and Facebook each have dedicated teams working on new haptics products. Scores of startups, too, are currently bringing new hardware and software solutions to market: Ultraleap (formerly Ultrahaptics), a Bristol-based company that develops midair haptics, has secured $85 million in funding; HaptX, which makes exoskeleton force feedback gloves for use in VR and remote manipulation, has raised $19 million in funding; and Neosensory, focused on routing sound through the skin with a wrist-based wearable Buzz, has received $16 million in funds. A recent industry-wide initiative intended to make it easier to embed haptics in multimedia content suggests that we could soon see growth in this area accelerate even further.
Despite these trends, the business of touch isnt heading in one clear direction. And with such variety in business responses, customers have responded with confusion, frustration, anxiety and defiance. More than disgruntlement, though, COVID-19 shines a light on a longstanding debate over whether the future will have more touch or less. Tensions around touch were already high, but rapid changes, Band-Aid solutions and short-term thinking are making the problems worse.
Whats needed now is a longer view: serious, systematic thinking about where we — as consumers, citizens, humans — want and need touch, and where we dont. To get there, we need greater investment not just in technologies that sound good, but ones that will deliver on real needs for connection and safety in the days ahead.
Plexiglass is the new mask
While the mask may be the most conspicuous symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic in much of the world, the new normal has another, clearer symbol: plexiglass.
Plexiglass leads the way as our environments are retrofitted to protect against the virus. In the U.S., demand began rising sharply in March, driven first by hospitals and essential retailers like grocery stores. Traditional sectors like automotive are using much less of the stuff, but that difference is more than made up for by the boom among restaurants, retail, office buildings, airports and schools. Plexiglass is even popping up in temples of bodily experience, surrounding dancers at strip clubs, clients at massage parlors and gymgoers in fitness centers.
Like plexiglass itself, the implications for touch are stark, if invisible. Plexiglass may communicate sterility and protection — though, truth be told, it dirties often and its easy to get around. More to the point, it puts up a literal barrier between us.
The story of plexiglass — like that of single-use plastic, ventilation systems, hand sanitizer and ultraviolet light — underscores how mundane interventions often win the day, at least initially. It is much easier for a grocery store to install an acrylic sneezeguard between cashiers and customers than it is to adopt contactless shopping or curbside pickup. At their best, interventions like plexiglass are low-cost, effective and dont require huge behavior changes on the part of customers. They are also largely reversible, should our post-pandemic lifestyles revert back to something more closely resembling our previous behaviors.
Besides their obvious environmental consequences, plasticized approaches can erode our relationship to touch and thereby to each other. In Brazil, for example, some nursing homes have installed “hug tunnels” to allow residents to embrace family members through a plastic barrier. Given that “when will I be able to hug my loved ones again?” is a common and heart-wrenching question these days, the reunions hug tunnels facilitate are, well, touching. But as a shadow of the real thing, they amplify our desperate need for real connection.
The same with circles on the floor in elevators or directional arrows down store aisles: In expecting us to be our best, most rational and most orderly selves, they work against cultural inclinations toward closeness. They indicate not so much a brave new future as a reluctant present. And without proper messaging about their importance as well as their temporariness, they are bound to fail.
Touch tech to the rescue
To feed our skin hunger, futurists are pushing haptic solutions digital technologies that can replicate and simulate physical sensations. Haptics applications range from simple notification buzzes to complex whole-body systems that combine vibration, electricity and force feedback to re-create the tactile materiality of the physical world. But although the resurgence of VR has rapidly advanced the state of the art, very few of these new devices are consumer-ready (one notable exception is CuteCircuits Hug Shirt released for sale earlier this year after 15+ years in development).
Haptics are typically packaged as part of other digital techs like smartphones, video game controllers, fitness trackers and smartwatches. Dedicated haptic devices remain rare and relatively expensive, though their imminent arrival is widely promoted in popular media and the popular technology press. Effective haptic devices, specially designed to communicate social and emotional touch such as stroking, would seem particularly useful to re-integrate touch into Zoom-heavy communication.
Even with well-resourced companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Disney buying in, these applications will not be hitting home offices or teleconferencing setups anytime soon. Though it would be easy to imagine, for example, a desktop-mounted system for facilitating remote handshakes, mass producing such devices would prove expensive, due in part to the pricey motors necessary to accurately synthesize touch. Using cheaper components compromises haptic fidelity, and at this point, what counts as an acceptable quality of haptic simulation remains ill-defined. We dont have a tried and tested compression standard for haptics the way we do with audio, for instance; as Immersion Corporations Yeshwant Muthusamy recently argued, haptics has been held back by a problematic lack of standards.
Getting haptics right remains challenging despite more than 30 years’ worth of dedicated research in the field. There is no evidence that COVID is accelerating the development of projects already in the pipeline. The fantasy of virtual touch remains seductive, but striking the golden mean between fidelity, ergonomics and cost will continue to be a challenge that can only be met through a protracted process of marketplace trial-and-error. And while haptics retains immense potential, it isnt a magic bullet for mending the psychological effects of physical distancing.
Curiously, one promising exception is in the replacement of touchscreens using a combination of hand-tracking and midair haptic holograms, which function as button replacements. This product from Bristol-based company Ultraleap uses an array of speakers to project tangible soundwaves into the air, which provide resistance when pressed on, effectively replicating the feeling of clicking a button.
Ultraleap recently announced that it would partner with the cinema advertising company CEN to equip lobby advertising displays found in movie theaters around the U.S. with touchless haptics aimed at allowing interaction with the screen without the risks of touching one. These displays, according to Ultraleap, will limit the spread of germs and provide safe and natural interaction with content.
A recent study carried out by the company found that more than 80% of respondents expressed concerns over touchscreen hygiene, prompting Ultraleap to speculate that we are reaching the end of the [public] touchscreen era. Rather than initiate a technological change, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to push ahead on the deployment of existing technology. Touchscreens are no longer sites of naturalistic, creative interaction, but are now spaces of contagion to be avoided. Ultraleaps version of the future would have us touching air instead of contaminated glass.
Touch/less
The notion that touch is in crisis has been a recurring theme in psychology, backed by scores of studies that demonstrate the negative neurophysiological consequences of not getting enough touch. Babies who receive insufficient touch show higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can have all kinds of negative effects on their development. In prisons, for example, being deprived of touch through restraint or solitary confinement is a punishment tantamount to torture. As technology continues to make inroads into our lives, interactions that once required proximity or touch have become mediated instead, prompting ongoing speculation about the consequences of communicating by technology rather than by touch.
The coronavirus pandemic intensifies this crisis by demanding a sudden, collective withdrawal from physical contact. The virus lays a cruel trap: the longer were apart, the more we crave togetherness and are willing to take dangerous risks. But giving in to the desire to touch not only exposes us and those we care about to a potentially mortal danger, it also extends the amount of time before we can resume widespread touching.
The pandemic has already revealed important lessons about touch, haptics and humanity. First is that while circumstances can change quickly, true social and behavioral change takes longer. The many examples of Americans acting as though there is no pandemic going on should give pause to anyone thinking touch-free futures are just around the corner. Atop this, there is plain-old inertia and malaise, which suggests some pandemic-era interventions will stick around while others will disappear or slacken over time. Consider 9/11 — nearly two decades later, though we still cant greet our loved ones at their gate, most airports dont strictly monitor our liquids and gels.
By the same token, one can imagine unfilled hand sanitizer stations as the ultimate hangover from these times. We may begin to like the plexiglass barriers between ourselves and our fellow subway passengers, but hate them at restaurants and sporting events. We may encounter more motion-detecting sliding doors and hand-tracking options, but when they falter we may revert to revolving doors, handles and push-buttons.
A second and equally important insight is that the past and the future exist side by side. Technological development takes even longer than behavioral change, and can be bedeviled by momentary trends, expense and technological limitations. For example, there are a lot of pressures right now to transform stores and restaurants into last-mile fulfillment centers, to embrace AR and VR and to reimagine space as contact-free. In these scenarios, objects could be touched and handled in virtual showrooms using high-fidelity digital touch technologies. But some of this pressure is based on promises that haptics have yet to fulfill. For instance, being able to touch clothing through a mobile phone may be possible in theory, but would be difficult in practice and would mean other trade-offs for mobile phones functionality, size, weight and speed.
Touch/more?
But just as the coronavirus pandemic did not create making us miss touching, it also did not create all the problems with touching. Some of the touch we were used to — like the forced closeness of a crowded subway car or the cramped quarters of airline seats — is dehumanizing. Social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have drawn attention to how unwanted touch can have traumatic consequences and exacerbate power imbalances. We must think broadly about the meaning of touch and its benefits and drawbacks for varying types of people, and not rush toward a one-size-fits-all solution. Although touch may seem like a fundamentally biological sense, its meaning is continually renegotiated in response to shifting cultural conditions and new technologies. COVID-19 is the most rapid upheaval in global practices of touching that weve seen in at least a generation, and it would be surprising not to see a corresponding adoption of technologies that could allow us to gain back some of the tactility, even from a distance, that the disease has caused us to give up.
Too often, however, touch technologies prompt a “gee whiz” curiosity without being attentive to the on-the-ground needs for users in their daily lives. Businesses looking to adopt haptic tech must see through the sales pitch and far-flung fantasies to develop a long-term plan for where touch and touch-free make the most sense. And haptic designers must move from a narrow focus on solving the complex engineering problem touch presents to addressing the sorts of technologies users might comfortably incorporate into their daily communication habits.
A useful exercise going forward is to consider how would we do haptic design differently knowing wed be facing another COVID-19-style pandemic in 2030? What touch technologies could be advanced to satisfy some of the desires for human contact? How can firms be proactive, rather than reactive, about haptic solutions? As much as those working in the field of haptics may have been motivated by the noble intention of restoring touch to human communication, this mission has often lacked a sense of urgency. Now that COVID-19 has distanced us, the need for haptics to bridge that physical gap, however incompletely, becomes more obvious and demanding.
Businesses feel it too, as they attempt to restore humanity and connection to their customer interactions. Yet as ironic as it might feel, now is the time not to just stumble through this crisis — its time to prepare for the next one. Now is the time to build in resilience, flexibility and excess capacity. To do so requires asking hard questions, like: do we need VR to replicate the sensory world in high fidelity, even if its costly? Or would lower-cost and lower-fidelity devices suffice? Will people accept a technologized hug as a meaningful proxy for the real thing? Or, when touch is involved, is there simply no substitute for physical presence? Might the future have both more touch and less?
These are difficult questions, but the hardship, trauma and loss of COVID-19 proves they demand our best and most careful thinking. We owe it to ourselves now and in the future to be deliberate, realistic and hopeful about what touch and technology can do, and what they cant."

In the video clip, taken from a Wednesday morning Fox News interview, President Trump makes the unfounded assertion that children are “almost immune” from COVID-19.
“If you look at children, children are almost and I would almost say definitely but almost immune from this disease,” Trump said. “They don’t have a problem. They just don’t have a problem.”
While Trump’s main account @realDonaldTrump linked out to the @TeamTrump tweet in violation, it did not directly share it. In spite of some mistaken reports that Trump’s own account is locked, at this time his account had not been subject to the same enforcement action as the Trump campaign account, which appears to have regained its ability to tweet around 6PM PT.
“The @TeamTrump Tweet you referenced is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation,” Twitter spokesperson Aly Pavela said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again.”
Facebook also took its own unprecedented action against President Trump’s account late Wednesday, removing the post for violating its rules against harmful false claims that any group is immune to the virus.
The president’s false claims were made in service of his belief that schools should reopen their classrooms in the fall. In June, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made similar unscientific claims, arguing that children are “stoppers of the disease.”
In reality, the relationship between children and the virus is not yet well understood. While young children seem less prone to severe cases of COVID-19, the extent to which they contract and spread the virus isn’t yet known. In a new report examining transmission rates at a Georgia youth camp, the CDC observed that “children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, contrary to early reports, might play an important role in transmission.”"

Some of them focus exclusively on the region, while others invest elsewhere as well. As they explained, the city has a lot going for it: It’s diverse, has access to locally trained engineering and business workers, and the area has already fostered many companies that are doing very well.
Investors expect Toronto to remain a fintech hub
Fintech is one of the city’s top industries, and the investors in this survey expect this to continue. Stephanie Choo, head of investments at Portag3 Ventures, said “fintech continues to see massive tailwinds from the fallout from COVID-19 as incumbents struggle to fully digitize their offerings.”
Ameet Shah of Golden Ventures listed fintech as one of Toronto’s key industries. Eva Lau of Two Small Fish Ventures agreed, adding that “blockchain has also been doing well because many blockchain-related technologies or companies were started in Toronto.”
Other investors point to fintech business leaders in Toronto like CEOs Mike Katchen of Wealthsimple, Daniel Eberhard of Koho, Andrew DSouza and Michele Romanow of Clearbanc and Kirk Simpson of Wave Financial.
Diversity is one of Toronto’s strengths
Nearly all of the surveyed investors cited diversity as a key reason to live and work in Toronto. Probal Lala, chairman of Maple Leaf Angels, says, “Beyond having a vibrant technology ecosystem, Toronto has one of the most diverse communities in North America and is not only a great place to find the intellectual horsepower and funding to build a great global startup, but also the mosaic of social communities that makes it a great place to live and raise a family.”
Choo said the United States’ current battles over immigration could benefit Canada. “Small, nimble teams that need to move fast may still choose to co-locate in person and many will still want access to amenities that only a large, vibrant and diverse city like Toronto can offer.”
She also pointed to Toronto’s claim of being one of the most diverse cities in the world. “[This] not only makes the city interesting but also very welcoming for those who relocate from elsewhere; a strong startup and tech scene, and, lastly, a vibrant cultural and food scene, especially through the lens of cost-of-living compared to comparable major cities.”
Shopify’s executives are key players in Toronto’s ecosystem
Several VCs listed Shopify executives as local leaders, while others acknowledged the growing unicorn’s impact. Ameet Shah of Golden Ventures says, “Toronto has traditionally been strong in fintech, B2B SaaS, crypto and AI. The explosion of Shopify should also benefit companies focused on e-commerce and supply chain solutions.”
Adam McNamara and Ameet Shah, when asked about local business leaders, both listed Satish Kanwar. Kanwar is GM and VP of Product at Shopify after the company purchased Jet Cooper, a startup co-founded by Kanwar. McNamara also points to Farhan Thawar, Shopify’s VP of Engineering, as a local leader.

How much is local investing even a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
Prior to COVID-19 hitting, a requirement for the majority of my investments was a face-to-face visit with the founding team. For the most part, this meant founders spending time in Toronto. As we primarily invest in seed and pre-seed, this usually meant local founders.
When the pandemic hit, we shifted our process to primarily Zoom meetings (including due diligence) and as a result the mix of founding teams has expanded beyond our typical catchment area (two-hour drive from the city) to a broader base. Investment cycles appear to have slowed a bit due to the remote approach but our reach to founding teams has expanded to a broader base of geographically distributed founding teams (Mostly Canadian although we have recently seen a number of international opportunities)."

Direct is a delivery platform for retail items, while Connect is a peer-to-peer package delivery service, for sending goods to family and friends. This marks the most aggressive foray yet for Uber into courier services, after it already introduced grocery items to its Uber Eats platform as the coronavirus pandemic continues to suppress its ride-hailing business.
Uber has already also introduced new extensions of its platform for transporting personal protective equipment to front-line workers, and Eats is also delivering convenience items in some markets in addition to grocery goods. The Direct and Connect services will likewise open in select cities initially, and the service looks very different depending on where it’s in use. IN NYC, for instance, it’s delivering over-the-counter medications in partnership with Cabinet, whereas in Portugal it’s essentially supplementing the public postal service with general mail parcel delivery.
Uber Connect provides same-day, on-contact delivery from one person to another, which Uber positions as a way for people to send care packages, supplies, games and other quarantine daily staples with their friends and family. It’s launching in over 25 cities across Australia, Mexico and the U.S. to start. At heart, Connect isn’t much different from Uber’s basic rider service, but instead of transporting people door-to-door, it’s moving stuff.
Both of these are being introduced today but will evolve over time as Uber sees how usage proceeds, and what people want out of the service. Stepping up on the goods delivery front should also mean bolstering utilization rates for drivers, and continued income in the face of massive decreases in demand for general rider transportation services, even as Uber Eats sees a big usage spike as more people seek direct-to-door food delivery."

Musk tweeted a series of things on Tuesday, including an endorsement of a controversial Wall Street Journal op-ed with the caption “Give people their freedom back!”
A Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch that these tweets, which also include an urging to “FREE AMERICA NOW,” are “not currently in violation of the Twitter rules. According to the company, it has said previously that it’s not enforcing punitive or corrective action on each instance of tweets about COVID-19 that don’t provide a full picture or that appear to contain info that’s disputed by other sources.
Twitter says that it has removed over 2,400 Tweets since March 18 when it implemented its new policy, and that it’s automated filtering systems have addressed in some way or another as many as 3.4 million accounts which seemed to be spamming or providing manipulative info regarding COVID-19 discussions. Thus far, however, some of the most influential sources of have not been subject to punitive or corrective action under the policy.
President Trump’s tweets calling to “liberate” states, for instance, which bear a content and formatting similarity to the new tweets by Musk, have not been removed or disputed by the social network, and Twitter provided a similar statement about those missives not currently violating its rules.
Trump and Musk represent some of the most influential Twitter users, with 78.9 million and 33.3 minion users respectively, so their voices have outweighed impact on the community and public discourse relative to spam or automated misinformation accounts. In both cases, these messages indirectly seek to encourage the curtailing or disruption of social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures, even as the U.S. surged past 1 million diagnosed cases this week, with many more likely undiagnosed and therefore unaccounted for in the total.
States are already beginning to ease restrictions, and seeing resurgences in case numbers. Some more rural states that previously seemed less impacted are seeing spikes, even as they began to partially reopen, including Iowa. Leading experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. federal coronavirus task force have warned against the consequences of relaxing rules too soon, and the WHO and CDC are still warning of the impact of opening up too soon as well."

Today the company said it would be reducing employee count by 17%, working out to 982 employees, and furloughing an additional 288, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Lyft’s business.
It will also put in place salary reductions of 30%  for executive leadership, 20% for vice presidents and 10% for all other employees, while members of Lyft’s board of directors will forego 30% of their cash compensation for the second quarter of 2020.
Lyft said that it will take a restructuring charge of between $28 million and $36 million as a result, which will come through in its Q2 financials.
The news comes in the wake of technology sector layoffs now crossing 32,221 people since March 11. Transportation has been hit in a particularly tough way, in part because people are not moving around as much due to stay-at-home orders; and in part because of the worries of infection that people have around driving in vehicles in close quarters where others have been.
Heading into 2020 Uber and Lyft had made (adjusted) profitability promises to their investors, pledges that could be in doubt thanks to COVID-19 and its impacts on travelling. However, earlier this year Uber held a conference with analysts in which is promised that it would not run out on cash, even if ride-hailing cratered and stayed sharply depressed for the rest of the year.
Uber and Lyft shares rose in the wake of the news. Today, the day after Uber’s reported consideration of staff cuts and Lyft’s confirmed staff reductions, the company’s are up 6% and 5%, respectively. Investors appear unconcerned that removing staff will harm operations. Indeed, the change in the value firms appears more endorsement of the cuts than concern about their necessity. (TechCrunch dug into Uber’s potential cuts this morning.)
It’s earnings season, with Uber reporting May 7 and Lyft a day earlier on May 6. We’ll know a lot more soon."

Europe’s data protection framework wraps around all such digital interventions, meaning there are legal requirements for EU countries and authorities developing tracing tools or soliciting data for a coronavirus related purpose.
“These guidelines clarify the conditions and principles for the proportionate use of location data and contact tracing tools, for two specific purposes: using location data to support the response to the pandemic by modelling the spread of the virus so as to assess the overall effectiveness of confinement measures; [and] contact tracing, which aims to notify individuals of the fact that they have been in close proximity of someone who is eventually confirmed to be a carrier of the virus, in order to break the contamination chains as early as possible,” the EDPB writes in the document.
The European Commission and the EU parliament have already weighed in with their own recommendations in this area, including a toolbox to help guide contacts tracing app developers. The Commission has also urged Member States to take a common approach to building such apps. And has been leaning on local telcos to provide ‘anonymized and aggregated’ metadata for modelling the spread of the virus across the EU.
The guideline document from the EDPB — a body made up of representatives from the EU’s national data protection agencies which helps coordinate the application of pan-EU data protection law — brings additional expert steerage for those developing digital interventions as part of a public health response to the coronavirus pandemic.
“The EDPB generally considers that data and technology used to help fight COVID-19 should be used to empower, rather than to control, stigmatise, or repress individuals,” it writes. “Furthermore, while data and technology can be important tools, they have intrinsic limitations and can merely leverage the effectiveness of other public health measures. The general principles of effectiveness, necessity, and proportionality must guide any measure adopted by Member States or EU institutions that involve processing of personal data to fight COVID-19.”
Among the body’s specific recommendations are that where location data is being considered for modelling the spread of the coronavirus or assessing the effectiveness of national lockdown measures then anonymizing the data is preferable — with the EDPB emphasizing that proper anonymization is not easy.
Given the inherent complexity it also recommends transparency around the anonymization methodology used. (tl;dr: there’s no security in obscurity, nor indeed accountability.)
“Many options for effective anonymisation exist, but with a caveat. Data cannot be anonymised on their own, meaning that only datasets as a whole may or may not be made anonymous,” it notes.
“A single data pattern tracing the location of an individual over a significant period of time cannot be fully anonymised. This assessment may still hold true if the precision of the recorded geographical coordinates is not sufficiently lowered, or if details of the track are removed and even if only the location of places where the data subject stays for substantial amounts of time are retained. This also holds for location data that is poorly aggregated.
“To achieve anonymisation, location data must be carefully processed in order to meet the reasonability test. In this sense, such a processing includes considering location datasets as a whole, as well as processing data from a reasonably large set of individuals using available robust anonymisation techniques, provided that they are adequately and effectively implemented.”
On contact tracing apps — aka digital tools that are designed to map proximity between individuals, as a proxy for infection risk — the EDPB urges that use of such apps be voluntary.
“The systematic and large scale monitoring of location and/or contacts between natural persons is a grave intrusion into their privacy,” it warns. “It can only be legitimised by relying on a voluntary adoption by the users for each of the respective purposes. This would imply, in particular, that individuals who decide not to or cannot use such applications should not suffer from any disadvantage at all.”
The importance of accountability is also front and center, with the EDPB saying the controller of such apps must be clearly defined.
“The EDPB considers that the national health authorities could be the controllers for such application; other controllers may also be envisaged. In any cases, if the deployment of contact tracing apps involves different actors their roles and responsibilities must be clearly established from the outset and be explained to the users.”
Purpose limitation is another highlighted component. Apps need to have purposes that are “specific enough to exclude further processing for purposes unrelated to the management of the COVID- 19 health crisis (e.g., commercial or law enforcement purposes)”, it says.
So, in other words, no function creep — and no EU citizen mass surveillance via a pandemic backdoor.
The EDPB also writes that “careful consideration should be given to the principle of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default” — noting specifically that contact tracing apps “do not require tracking the location of individual users”.
Instead “proximity data should be used” for the contacts tracing purpose.
“Contact tracing applications can function without direct identification of individuals,” it further emphasizes, adding that “appropriate measures should be put in place to prevent re-identification”.
The guidance aligns with the coronavirus contacts tracing model devised jointly by Apple and Google — which have said they will be offering a cross-platform API for COVID-19 contacts tracing based on ephemeral proximity IDs shared via Bluetooth.
At one point the EDPB guidance appears to be leaning towards favoring such decentralized approaches to contacts tracing apps, with the body writing that “the collected information should reside on the terminal equipment of the user and only the relevant information should be collected when absolutely necessary”.
Although later on the in guidance it discussed centralized models that involve proximity data being uploaded to a server in the cloud, writing that: “Implementations for contact tracing can follow a centralized or a decentralized approach. Both should be considered viable options, provided that adequate security measures are in place, each being accompanied by a set of advantages and disadvantages.”
In Europe there is currently a big fight between different camps over whether contacts tracing apps should use a centralized or decentralized model for storing and processing proximity data — with a contacts tracing app standardization effort known as PEPP-PT that’s backed by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications and some EU governments wanting to support centralized protocols for COVID-19 contacts tracking, while a separate coalition of European academics wants only decentralized approaches on privacy grounds, and has developed a protocol called DP-3T.
“The current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to establish disproportionate data retention mandates,” the EDPB warns. “Storage limitation should consider the true needs and the medical relevance (this may include epidemiology-motivated considerations like the incubation period, etc.) and personal data should be kept only for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. Afterwards, as a general rule, all personal data should be erased or anonymised.”
The body also recommends algorithms used in contacts tracing apps be audited and regularly reviewed by outside experts.
Again, a key criticism of the PEPP-PT initiative has been around lack of transparency — including its failure to publish code for external review. (Though it has said it will be publishing code.)
“In order to ensure their fairness, accountability and, more broadly, their compliance with the law, algorithms must be auditable and should be regularly reviewed by independent experts. The applications source code should be made publicly available for the widest possible scrutiny,” the EDPB writes.
Another notable piece of the guidance is for a data protection impact assessment not only to be carried out but that it be published — which marks a further push for accountability via transparency in such an unprecedented moment.
“The EDPB considers that a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out before implementing such tool as the processing is considered likely high risk (health data anticipated large-scale adoption, systematic monitoring, use of new technological solution). The EDPB strongly recommends the publication of DPIAs,” it writes.
Typically DPAs leave it up to data controllers to decide whether to publish a DPIA or not — in this case the strong push from the central authority is that these documents are made public where COVID-19 contacts tracing apps are concerned.
Having highlighted the pros and cons of centralized vs decentralized approaches to contacts tracing, the EDPB goes on to recommend that the conceptual phase of app development “should always include thorough consideration of both concepts carefully weighing up the respective effects on data protection/privacy and the possible impacts on individuals rights”.
“Any server involved in the contact tracing system must only collect the contact history or the pseudonymous identifiers of a user diagnosed as infected as the result of a proper assessment made by health authorities and of a voluntary action of the user. Alternately, the server must keep a list of pseudonymous identifiers of infected users or their contact history only for the time to inform potentially infected users of their exposure, and should not try to identify potentially infected users.”
“Putting in place a global contact tracing methodology including both applications and manual tracing may require additional information to be processed in some cases. In this context, this additional information should remain on the user terminal and only be processed when strictly necessary and with his prior and specific consent,” it adds.

The hardware, dubbed ‘Spiro Wave,’ is an emergency automated resuscitator that can be produced for under $5,000, and that a team of engineers, doctors and researchers has already begun producing and delivering to care facilities.
The Spiro Wave essentially replicates the functionality of a manual resuscitator, a portable device is typically operated manually to provide ventilation to emergency patients in case of emergency, but it automated the process, while still working with the same types of bags that are typically used with the manual version for easier sourcing of supplies.
Spiro Wave is based on MIT’s open-source E-Vent prototype design, which was created by researchers at the institution as one way to alleviate the shortage that resulted from the COVID-19 crisis. From that design, the team behind Spiro Wave, which includes the co-founders of Newly, 10XBeta and Boyce Technologies, were able to go from design to production of their emergency ventilator in just a few weeks.
Manufacturing partner Boyce says that it can hopefully ramp production not as much as 500 per day, at its Long Island City production facility in Queens, and the first few hundred are already shipping out to facilities in NYC starting this week. The team is also now looking for international production scaling assistance with partners who are registered to produce medical devices with the FDA in order to increase supply even further.
The team behind this note that it’s not meant to replace a full-fledged ventilator, but that it will instead help alleviate the drain on those resources used in emergency care situations where a respirator would be just as effective, but where the manual version is impractical in terms of staffing and prolonged use. Like so many other measures granted EUA, this may not be an ideal replacement for fully FDA-approved equipment and therapies, but it’s an innovative, scalable solution that could mean big differences in the level of care at overburdened healthcare facilities."

The letter, not yet published but obtained by NPR (I’ve asked the NY AG for confirmation of the contents), is only informational and does not amount to legal action. But the wording is strong enough to suggest that legal action may be the next step.
While we continue to investigate, the information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon’s health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
These are precisely the concerns brought up by many warehouse workers over the last two months, including Chris Smalls, who was fired in March after protesting the conditions at the facility where he worked.
In this midst of a pandemic, Chris Smalls &amp; his colleagues bravely protested the lack of precautions that @amazon employed to protect them from #COVID19. Then he was fired. 
I'm considering all legal options &amp; calling on the NLRB to investigate. 
Amazon, this is disgraceful. https://t.co/Cgu09LmwHL
— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) March 31, 2020
Amazon says Smalls was not fired for riling up the workers. Yet reportedly at a meeting attended by Jeff Bezos, the company’s General Counsel suggested making him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement” before following with “our usual talking points about worker safety.”
(Amazon would not confirm or deny those comments took place when TechCrunch asked about them at the time, but did provide a quoted apology by the person who may or may not have said them.)
Two more outspoken employees were fired two weeks later for “repeatedly violating internal policies.” Naturally the usual talking points followed.
The NY AG’s letter said the office is looking into “cases of potential illegal retaliation,” and addresses this pattern as follows:
This Office has learned that many workers are fearful about speaking out about their concerns following the termination of Mr. Smalls’ employment. This is a particularly dangerous message to send during a pandemic, when chilling worker speech about health and safety practices could literally be a matter of life and death.
Amazon routinely protests that it is a paragon when it comes to labor, but is just as routinely contradicted by workers, like Smalls, who have experienced the reality of working at its warehouses.
Amazon issued its “usual talking points” to NPR as a response to the story, saying: “We encourage anyone to compare the health and safety measures Amazon has taken, and the speed of their implementation, during this crisis with other retailers.” The attorney general seems prepared to take the company up on that invitation."

The surge in demand for the company’s services has led to an equal surge in investor interest, and LetsGetChecked is one of many home health and remote diagnostics companies to raise new capital during the pandemic.
The company’s new $71 million financing isn’t just about the services the company can provide during the COVID-19 epidemic. Now that an increasing number of Americans are accessing home health services, they’ll likely continue to use them thanks to their convenience and ease of use, according to LetsGetChecked chief executive, Peter Foley.
“People are very focused on COVID-19. [But] were seeing trends of increases in everything else,” said Foley. “This situation has definitely legitimized the space of home diagnostics. We are seeing spikes in those kinds of tests. Everything that needs monitoring were seeing spikes in.”
Most consumers are avoiding doctors, hospitals and clinics out of concern over the epidemic and that’s pushing them to use telemedicine and remote testing services, said Foley.
And the company has stepped up to address the coronavirus outbreak itself. The company, which has a manufacturing facility in Queens where it makes its own test kits has been unfazed by the supply chain issues that have hit other companies, said Foley. And LetsGetChecked has a certified lab facility where it can conduct its own tests.
LetsGetChecked at-home Coronavirus test kit.
Right now, the company is offering both a serological test (sourced from a Korean lab and awaiting approval by the FDA) and a PCR test (from ThermoFisher) for SARS-CoV-2 and is looking to expand the scope of its tests. The LetsGetChecked tests include a rapid (antibody) serology test for results within 15 minutes, followed by a PCR-based test which requires a swab sample to be collected from a patient and later processed within the LetsGetChecked high complexity CLIA lab in Monrovia, Calif., the company said. Initially the testing was for first responders and those most at risk from the disease, but the population that the company is testing is expanding as the spread of the virus slows.
“We were fortunate enough to be in a position where we could help people now,” says Foley.
LetsGetChecked isn’t the only startup at work developing and distributing home testing services for the coronavirus. Everlywell and Scanwell Health are two other startups that have been developing and selling home test kits as well.
LetsGetChecked began fundraising four months ago, and even then, in the days before COVID-19 hit American shores, the environment for raising capital had tightened, Foley said.
In the days before the disease reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. LetsGetChecked was pitching its ability to test at-home or through partner retailers for cancer screening, sexual health, fertility and pharmacogenomic testing.
Users can buy tests and collect samples at home before sending them to LetsGetChecked’s facility. The company connects its customers to board-certified physicians to discuss abnormal results and determine a course of action for treatment
The company’s initial pitch and the promise of a vast remote diagnostics market was enough to convince Illumina Ventures, which co-led the round with HLM Venture Partners. Other new investors included Deerfield, CommonFund Capital, and Angeles Investment Advisors. Previous investors Transformation Capital, Optum Vnetures, and Qiming Venture Partners USA also participated.
For Illumina Ventures, the LetsGetChecked remote testing service can serve as a channel for some of the tests under development at the firm’s other healthcare portfolio companies, according to Nick Naclerio, a founding partner at Illumina Ventures and a new director on the LetsGetChecked board.
“A lot of companies developing cutting edge new tests have challenges building a channel into the broader market,” said Naclerio. “Here is a company going after building the kind of future, patient-initiated testing channel that the world needs and is probably synergistic with some of the companies that are doing next generation testing.”
Those would be companies like Serimmune, which is developing tests to map the human immune system, or Genome Medical, which applies the latest understanding of the human genome to treatments for patients. The firm also has investments in cancer screening companies like Grail, which is aiming to provide an early detection diagnostic for cancer.
Naclerio also sees a dramatic shift in consumer behavior on the horizon in the post-COVID-19 world.
“COVID presents a tremendous need for at-home infectious disease testing or at-work infectious disease testing,” he said. “This is breaking down a lot of the barriers that have historically slowed the adoption of telehealth… It creates an opportunity for LetsGetChecked even once we get over the peak of the curve. Theres going to be a lasting impact.”"

The news was first noted by The Verge. The employee began to exhibit symptoms in early April, before being placed on quarantine April 11. He never returned to the site.
“We are deeply saddened by the loss of an associate at our site in Staten Island, NY,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “His family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues.
Amazon says it doesn’t believe any of the individual cases at the Staten Island facility are directly linked. It notes that the employee was not contact-traced to any others in the warehouse.
Classified as an essential service, Amazon never shut down operations amid local stay at home orders. Last month, the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post reported in mid-April that workers in at least 74 of Amazons warehouse and fulfillment centers have tested positive for the virus. In late-March, an employee at the companys facility in Hawthorne, Calif. died from the virus a few days after exhibiting symptoms.
The company has been criticized for failing to provide proper protection against the spread of the virus, as workers push to get packages out to house-bound consumers. Its an accusation Amazon has flatly denied, both in statements and in Jeff Bezoss shareholder letter, which laid out safeguards and plans to build a testing facility exclusively for Amazon employees. 
The company began offering guidelines after a Staten Island worker tested positive in mid-March. It’s not clear how many workers have tested positive for or died from the virus. 
The company was one of several prominent retailers targeted in last Fridays May Day protests, while earlier this week, VP Tim Bray left the company out of protest over the firings of multiple whistleblowers. 
JFK8, the massive Staten Island facility that serves as a hub for New York City, has been a focal point for multiple Amazon protests during the pandemic."

As Business Insider reported, clicking through the label leads to a page collecting sources debunking claims with links to pages like the BBC and Snopes. Earlier this year, the conspiracy was linked to a series of arson attacks on 5G towers.
Twitter’s latest wave of fact-checking labels appears to have been applied pretty broadly, even on some tweets making jokes or references to the label itself.
Expanding its fact-checking labels to apply to coronavirus 5G conspiracies is the latest instance of Twitter’s evolving platform moderation efforts. The labels stop a step short of screening or removing content altogether, instead offering up additional context and letting users reach their own conclusions. At the very least, even with its mild wording, the warning labels should help flag untrustworthy content for the platform’s most credulous users."

Atomico, GV, Kreos, NGP Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Swisscom Ventures also participated in the round — which brings its total raised to date to $123M.
The Zurich-based firm offers a platform that combines computer vision and machine learning tech with barcode scanning, text recognition (OCR), object recognition and augmented reality which is designed for any camera-equipped smart device — from smartphones to drones, wearables (e.g. AR glasses for warehouse workers) and even robots.
Use-cases include mobile apps or websites for mobile shopping; self checkout; inventory management; proof of delivery; asset tracking and maintenance — including in healthcare where its tech can be used to power the scanning of patient IDs, samples, medication and supplies.
It bills its software as “unmatched” in terms of speed and accuracy, as well as the ability to scan in bad light; at any angle; and with damaged labels. Target industries include retail, healthcare, industrial/manufacturing, travel, transport &amp; logistics and more.
The latest funding injection follows a $30M Series B round back in 2018. Since then Scandit says it’s tripled recurring revenues, more than doubling the number of blue-chip enterprise customers, and doubling the size of its global team.
Global customers for its tech include the likes of 7-Eleven, Alaska Airlines, Carrefour, DPD, FedEx, Instacart, Johns Hopkins Hospital, La Poste, Levi Strauss &amp; Co, Mount Sinai Hospital and Toyota — with the company touting “tens of billions of scans” per year on 100+ million active devices at this stage of its business.
It says the new funding will go on further pressing on the gas to grow in new markets, including APAC and Latin America, as well as building out its footprint and ops in North America and Europe. Also on the slate: Funding more R&amp;D to devise new ways for enterprises to transform their core business processes using computer vision and AR.
The need for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated demand for mobile computer vision on personal smart devices, according to Scandit, which says customers are looking for ways to enable more contactless interactions.
Another demand spike it’s seeing is coming from the pandemic-related boom in ‘Click &amp; Collect’ retail and “millions” of extra home deliveries — something its tech is well positioned to cater to because its scanning apps support BYOD (bring your own device), rather than requiring proprietary hardware.
COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the need for rapid digital transformation in these uncertain times, and the need to blend the physical and digital plays a crucial role, said CEO Samuel Mueller in a statement. Our new funding makes it possible for us to help even more enterprises to quickly adapt to the new demand for contactless business, and be better positioned to succeed, whatever the new normal is.
Also commenting on the funding in a supporting statement, Ben Kortlang, general partner at G2VP, added: “Scandit’s platform puts an enterprise-grade scanning solution in the pocket of every employee and customer without requiring legacy hardware. This bridge between the physical and digital worlds will be increasingly critical as the world accelerates its shift to online purchasing and delivery, distributed supply chains and cashierless retail.”"

We’re a large company with 135,000 employees in 70 different countries around the globe. So, of course, we had an early warning when it started actually in Asia. We have employees in Asia, so we got the feeling that this could be really serious. It was early in the first week of February, we moved to the highest emergency or crisis level in the company. That means that we go to a certain crisis mode on how we organized and how we galvanized the company.
That’s usually put into place every time there is a big national disaster because you need to split between people taking care of the crisis and people taking care of running the business. So we were very early on with that. In the beginning of February, we started the emergency crisis operations center that was taking care of employee questions and prioritization of important things. At the same time, we continued to run the business. That was the first thing we did very early on.
Upcoming Extra Crunch Live episodes include discussions with Aaron Levie from Box, GGV’s Hans Tung and Jeff Richards, and Eventbrite’s Julia Hartz.
The other thing we did very early on is that we understood that this was something unprecedented. I mean, you have been in crisis before. I mean, I’ve been in the telecom crisis, and we’ve been in the banking crisis when everything just went boom. This is something totally different. You cannot use any of your historical experience when it comes to this pandemic, which actually impacts each and every one of us when it comes to health. So I was honest, and thought that they’re going to be a lot of questions. We decided very early on to run our noon live webcast to our employees. We are on our… I think it’s the 11th week, where at noon every day, we run the webcast for all our employees. That was two of the first things we did.
We didn’t think we were going to run for 11 weeks on the new live webcast, but we have done it because we see there’s a very good tool to communicate with all our employees."

One of the most distressing aspects of the ongoing pandemic is that COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on communities of color and lower-income Americans due to structural factors rooted in history and long-standing societal biases.
Those most at risk during this pandemic are 24 million of the lowest-income workers; the people who have less job security and cant work from home. In fact, only 9.2% of the bottom 25% have the ability to work from home. Compare that to the 61.5% of the top 25% and the disparity is staggering. Additionally, people in these jobs typically do not have the financial security to avoid public interaction by stockpiling food and household goods, buying groceries online or avoiding public transit. They cannot self-isolate. They need to venture out far more than other groups, heightening their risk of infection.
The historically disadvantaged will also be hit the hardest by the economic impacts of the pandemic. They are overrepresented in the industries experiencing the worst downturn. The issues were atrocious prior to COVID-19, with the typical Black and Latinx households having a net worth of just $17,100 and $20,765, respectively, compared with the $171,000 held by the typical white household. An extended health and economic crisis will only exacerbate these already extreme disparities.
AI as a beacon of hope
A rare encouraging aspect of the ongoing pandemic response is the use of cutting-edge technology especially AI to address everything from supply chains to early-stage vaccine research.
The potential of human + AI exceeds the potential of humans working alone by far, but there are tremendous risks that require careful consideration. AI requires massive amounts of data, but ingrained in that data are the societal imperfections and inequities that have given rise to disproportionate health and financial impacts in the first place.
In short, we cannot use a tool until we know it works and understand the potential for unintended consequences. Some health groups hurried to repurpose existing AI models to help track patients and manage the supply of beds, ventilators and other equipment in their hospitals. Researchers have tried to develop AI models from scratch to focus on the unique effects of COVID-19, but many of those tools have struggled with bias and accuracy issues. Balancing the instinct to help now and the risks of unforeseen consequences amidst the high stakes of the COVID-19 pandemic is why the responsible use of AI is more important now than ever.
4 ways to purposefully and responsibly use AI to combat COVID-19
1. Avoid delegating to algorithms that run critical systems
Think of an AI system designed to distribute ventilators and medical equipment to hospitals with the objective of maximizing survival rates. Disadvantaged populations have higher comorbidities and thus may be less likely to receive supplies if the system is not properly designed. If these preexisting prejudices are not accounted for when designing the AI system, then well-intentioned efforts could result in directing supplies away from especially vulnerable communities.
Artificial intelligence is also being used to improve supply chains across all sectors. The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is prototyping AI that can track data on ventilators, PPE, medical supplies and food. When the goal is to anticipate panic-buying and ensure health care professionals have access to the equipment they need, this is a responsible use of AI.
As these examples illustrate, we can quickly arrive at a problematic use case when decision-making authority is delegated to an algorithm. The best and most responsible use of AI is maximizing efficiency to ensure the necessary supplies get to those truly in need. Previous failures in AI show the need for healthy skepticism when delegating authority on potentially life-and-death decisions to an algorithm.
2. Be wary of disproportional impacts and singling out specific communities
Think of an AI system that uses mobility data to detect localized communities that are violating stay-at-home orders and route police for additional enforcement. Disadvantaged populations do not have the economic means to stockpile food and other supplies, or order delivery, forcing them to go outside.  As we mentioned earlier, being overrepresented in frontline sectors means leaving the home more frequently. In addition, individuals and families experiencing homelessness could be targeted for violating stay-at-home enforcement. In New York City, police enforcement of stay-at-home directives has disproportionately targeted Black and Latinx residents. Here is where responsible AI steps in. AI systems should be designed not to punish these populations with police enforcement, but rather help identify the root causes and route additional food and resources. This is not a panacea, but will avoid exacerbating existing challenges.
Israel has already demonstrated that this model works. In mid-March it passed an emergency law enabling the use of mobile data to pinpoint the infected as well as those they had come in contact with. Maccabi Healthcare Services are using AI to ID its most at-risk customers and prioritize them for testing. This is a fantastic example of adopting previously responsible and successful AI by adapting an existing system that was built and trained to identify people most at risk for flu, using millions of records from over 27 years.
3. Establish AI that is human-centric with privacy by design and native controls
Think of an AI system that uses mobile phone apps to track infections and trace contacts in an effort to curb new infections. Minority and economically disadvantaged populations have lower rates of smartphone ownership than other groups. AI systems should take these considerations into account to avoid design bias. This will ensure adequate protections for vulnerable populations, but also improve the overall efficacy of the system since these individuals may have high human contact in their jobs. Ensuring appropriate track and trace takes place within these populations is critically important.
In the U.S., MIT researchers are developing Private Automatic Contact Tracing (PACT), which uses Bluetooth communications for contact tracing while also preserving individual privacy. If you test positive and inform the app, everyone who has been in close proximity to you in the last 14 days gets a notification. Anonymity and privacy are the biggest keys to responsible use of AI to curb the spread of COVID-19.
In India the governments Bridge to Health app uses a phone’s Bluetooth and location data to let users know if they have been near a person with COVID-19. But, again, privacy and anonymity are the keys to responsible and ethical use of AI.
This is a place where the true power of human + AI shines through. As these apps are rolled out, it is important that they are paired with human-based track and trace to account for disadvantaged populations. AI allows automating and scaling track and trace for most of the population; humans ensure we help the most vulnerable.
4. Validate systems and base decisions on sanitized representative data
Think of an AI system that helps doctors make rapid decisions on which patients to treat and how to treat them in an overburdened health care system. One such system developed in Wuhan identified biomarkers that correlate with higher survival rates to help doctors pinpoint which patients likely need critical care and which can avoid the hospital altogether.
The University of Chicago Medical Center is working to upgrade an existing AI system called eCART. The system will be enhanced for COVID to use more than 100 variables to predict the need for intubation eight hours in advance. While eight hours may not seem like much, it provides doctors an opportunity to take action before a patients condition deteriorates.
But, the samples and data sets systems like these rely on could have the potential to produce unreliable outcomes or ones that reinforce existing biases. If the AI is trained on observations of largely white individuals as was the case with data in the International Cancer Genome Consortium how willing would you be to delegate life-and-death health care decisions for a nonwhite patient? These are issues that require careful consideration and demonstrate why it is so important to validate not only the systems themselves, but also the data on which they rely.
Questions we must ask
As companies, researchers and governments increasingly leverage AI, a parallel discussion around responsible AI is necessary to ensure benefits are maximized while harmful consequences are minimized. We need better guidelines and assessments of AI around fairness, trustworthiness, bias and ethics.
There are dozens of dimensions we should evaluate every use case against to ensure it is developed in a responsible manner. But, these four simple questions provide a great framework to start a discussion between AI system developers and policy makers who may be considering deploying an AI solution to combat COVID-19.
<ul><li>What are the consequences if the system makes a mistake? Can we redesign the system to minimize this?</li><li>Can we clearly explain how the AI system produced specific outcomes in a way that is understandable to the general public?</li><li>What are potential sources of bias data, human and design and how can they be minimized?</li><li>What steps can be taken to protect the privacy of individuals?</li></ul>When to use AI solutions and tools
Each of these questions will apply in different ways to particular use cases. A natural language processing (NLP) system sifting through tens of thousands of scientific papers that might focus the search for a COVID-19 vaccine poses no direct threat of harm to individuals and performs a task faster that an army of research assistants ever could. Case in point, in April at Harvard the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project announced the Human Immunomics Initiative to leverage AI models to accelerate vaccine development.
This is a global effort with scientists around the world working together to expedite drug discovery processes to defeat COVID-19 through the use of AI. From the aforementioned work in the U.S. all the way to Australia where Oracle cloud technology and vaccine technology developed by Vaxine is being leveraged by Flinders University to develop promising vaccine candidates, we can see AI being used for its most ethical purpose, saving human lives.
Another use case is the omnipresent issue facing us during this pandemic: dissemination of misinformation across the planet. Imagine trying to manually filter the posts of the 1.7 billion daily Facebook users every day and scan for misinformation about COVID-19. This is an ideal project for human + AI with humans confirming cases of misinformation flagged by AI.
This use case is relatively low risk, but its ultimate success depends on human oversight and engagement. Thats even more so the case in the high-risk use cases that are grabbing headlines amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Human + AI is not just a safeguard against a system gone off the rails, its critical to AI delivering meaningful and impactful results as illustrated through earlier examples.
We need to classify use cases into three buckets to guide our decision making:
1. Red
<ul><li>Use case represents a decision that should not be delegated to an AI system.</li><li>Using an AI system to decide which patients receive medical treatment during a crisis. This is a case where humans should ultimately be making decisions because of their impact on life-and-death decisions. This has already been recognized by the medical community, where ethical frameworks have been developed to support these very types of decisions.</li></ul>2. Yellow
<ul><li>Use case could be deployed responsibly, but it depends upon the design and execution.</li><li>Using an AI system to monitor adherence to quarantine policies. This is a case where use cases may be acceptable depending on design and deployment of systems. For example, using the system to deploy police to neighborhoods to crackdown on individuals not adhering to quarantine policies would be problematic. But deploying police to these neighborhoods to understand why quarantine is being broken so policy makers can better address citizen needs would be legitimate provided privacy of individuals is protected.</li></ul>3. Green
<ul><li>Use case is low risk and the benefits far outweigh the risks.</li><li>Content filtering on social media platforms to ensure malicious and misleading information regarding COVID-19 is not shared widely.</li></ul>We must ask our four questions and deliberately analyze the answers we find. We can then responsibly and confidently decide which bucket to put the project into and move forward in a responsible and ethical manner.
A recent U.S. example
We recently created Lighthouse, a new dynamic navigation cockpit that helps organizations capture a holistic picture of the ongoing crisis. These lighthouses are being used to illuminate the multiple dimensions of the situation. For example, we recently partnered with an American city to develop a tool that predicted disruptions in the food supply chain. One data source was based on declines in foot traffic in and around distribution centers. Without accessing any personally identifiable information (PII) and therefore preserving individual privacy it shows which parts of the city were most likely to suffer shortages, enabling leaders to respond preemptively and prevent an even worse public health crisis.
This is an easily duplicated process that other organizations can follow to create and implement responsible AI to help the historically disenfranchised navigate and thrive during the age of COVID-19.
Moving forward
When confronting the ethical dilemmas presented by crises like COVID-19, enterprises and organizations equipped with responsible AI programs will be best positioned to offer solutions that protect the most vulnerable and historically disenfranchised groups by respecting privacy, eliminating historical bias and preserving trust. In the rush to help now, we cannot throw responsible AI out the window. In fact, in the age of COVID-19, it is more important than ever before to understand the unintended consequences and long-term effects of the AI systems we create."

But: there will be changes.
An exclusive survey compiled by Founders Forum, with TechCrunch, found 63% of those surveyed said they would only re-open in either 1-3 months or 3-6 months – even if the government advises that it is safe to do so before then. A minority have re-opened their offices, while 10% have closed their office permanently.
However, there will clearly be long-term impact on the model of office working, with a majority of those surveyed saying they would now move to either a flexible remote working model (some with permanent offices, some without), but only a small number plan a normal return to work. A very small number plan to go fully remote. Many cited the continuing benefits of face-to-face interaction when trying to build the team culture so crucial with early-stage companies.
Massive office closures during pandemicOf the 349 that answered the survey 84% said they had closed their office during the COVID-19 pandemic; 5% said they had not; and 8% said it was not applicable (i.e. no office to close). The majority of those answering were at Seed or Pre-seed stage, with a minority past Series A stage.
Crucially, a clear majority of respondents (66%) said the need to return to the office was not business critical, while 33% thought it was. Right now, startups are closely divided over feeling the need to return to the office, with 46% saying they did feel a need, while 53% said they did not.
The survey was launched by TechCrunch and UK non-profit Founders Forum in order to assess how startups will work in the future, in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemics impact on office working and the shift to ‘Work From Home’ policies. Of the 349 answers, 61% were from the UK, 20% from the US, and the rest from other countries.
Founders Forums Brent Hoberman, who initiated the study, commented on the results: The results prove both that early-stage tech founders are adaptable and that entrepreneurship is one of the best-suited professions to remote work. The majority of early-stage founders havent seen productivity take a hit during this period, but it remains to be seen what happens to creative output, team culture and training over the longer term. Furthermore, there are clearly opportunities for new types of even more flexible shared social workspaces with a vast majority of those surveyed still seeing value in face-to-face interaction.
Remote working ups productivity, but impacts culture Remote working during COVID-19 appears not to have impacted output, with 55% of startups saying they had worked more than normal; 30% the same hours, and 13% fewer hours.
In answer to the question: Are you going to permanently change how and where your team works together?: 48% said they would adopt a more flexible working arrangement (e.g. remote work days); 33% will adopt a remote-first setup (e.g. rented space for key meetings/workshops); 13% plan a normal return to work; and just 4% will adopt a fully remote configuration.
In terms of plans to re-open offices, 36% planned to re-open in 1-3 months as soon as government advises that it is safe to do so; 27% in 3-6 months even if the government advises that it is safe to do so before then; 16% answered It’s already open – employees have been visiting if they feel comfortable; 10% said We have closed the office permanently; and 9% said they planned to re-open in 6-12 months even if the government advises that it is safe to do so before then.
Given a full choice in the matter, 81% of those surveyed said they would prefer a hybrid of office and remote work, with only 11% wanting to go remote full time and 8% returning to an office full time. And 83% wanted to have set days when the whole team is in the office together.
Commenting on why they thought re-opening an office – in some form – was business-critical, comments from respondents included:
 My employees are looking to return to work given wanting space from home confinement”
 “Need for top management sessions where in-person is much more productive than remote video calls”
 Missing the power of face to face problem solving and building teams”
 “Ability to support early-career employees and bring on new ones”
 “I believe either fully remote or fully in-person setups are effective. A halfway house is ineffective.
 “Too difficult to achieve the cross-pollination and high-velocity communication needed at our early stage.
 “Culture. Younger team members can’t work from home all the time (shared accommodation). Some parents need the office to focus”
 “We’re a biotech company and need to work from our labs”
 “We do order fulfillment from our warehouse.”
 “Team members ask for it as they cannot stand anymore working alone in their apartment”
Most startups are offering remote work options either to some employees (52%) or to all employees (31%). Some 16% offered no remote working at all, especially in areas like BioTech where remote working from a lab is not possible.
Office spaces still adaptingThere were mixed results when startups were asked if they had renegotiated their lease as a result of COVID-19, with 16% of those on a short lease saying they had and were successful, but 16% saying they had, but had not been able to renegotiate. Some 14% on a long lease were successful in the renegotiation, 14% said they were still in negotiation and 11% had canceled the membership of their co-working space.
Some 41% of startups or their landlords had not performed a workplace risk assessment, 25% had, while 33% still planned to.
Offices appear to be responding well, with either 40% having already introduced measures to improve the safety of workplaces or 34% planning to, while 25% had not, probably because they do not have an office or use co-working spaces.
Most people (58%) said they felt the work they perform remotely is trusted and respected equally to the work I perform in the workplace. Most (50%) said their home setup was ok, but not ideal.
WFH impacts working practicesWhen asked What remote productivity tools or processes have become your secret weapon during COVID-19? notable answers included:
 Miro, trello, zoom, Asana, Airtable, Slack, Microsoft Teams (among many others)
 Two screens.
 “Dedicated office space at home”
 “Routine. Shutting off at 5.30pm and going for a run/walk”
 Saying hello and prioritizing chit chat on video calls every time, even though we all have work to do, observing social graciousness remotely is even more important. 
 “Company instituted “Summer Fridays” urging to not work after 1pm on Fridays – less pressure to be “always-on””
 Being able to step away and recharge through engaging with the family when needed during the day.”
 “Old school phone calls”

Its a pedestrian action, something we take entirely for granted the several times a day we do it. Over the past five months, however, handwashing has taken on a kind of central importance to our daily lives something to focus on and obsess over. 
We all read the WHO and CDC guidelines and shared (and perhaps even created) some of the millions of song lyric memes highlighting the proper length of time required to sufficiently clean ones hands and avoid virus transmission. Weve all also become painfully aware of just how long 20 seconds can feel when youre standing in front of the bathroom sink. 
Unlike other rush initiatives undertaken by the company once the virus hit, however, the forthcoming Apple Watch handwashing app wasnt built overnight. The feature was the result of years of work, VP of Technology Kevin Lynch told TechCrunch. In typical Apple fashion, the product was a result of years of trial and error, according to the executive.
Certainly its not the first smartwatch app to tackle this one banal action. Samsung was quick to the market to introduce a Galaxy Watch app designed for users wash their hands for the allotted time. But Apples version slots alongside such health features as the Noise app, and leverages the devices built-in sensors to provide clever applications that contribute to the wearables overall health focus. 
The feature, which is built directly into the forthcoming version of watchOS, is designed to work like fitness tracking in a number of ways. For starters, if the user opts into it, its designed to automatically trigger when handwashing is detected, starting a countdown timer of 20 seconds. The accelerometer is the key piece of hardware here, waiting for the specific handwashing pattern which apparently adopts a number of different methods, depending on whos actually doing the scrubbing.
The system uses machine learning models to tackle different methods, but the system gets an additional nudge from the Watchs microphone. Along with motion, the app listens for the sound of running water. Even thats not enough, though after all, eco sinks have become increasingly popular, meaning that theres often less water sound to be listening for. The sound of squishing soap takes care of that last bit. Its got a unique enough audio signature so as to confirm that handwashing is taking place. 
The feature flashes images of soap bubbles and buzzes the watchs haptics to encourage the wearer to go the distance offering polite encouragement if they pause. Like fitness tracking, that information is recorded in Apples health app. Again, what might otherwise feel like a silly little feature is suddenly taking on a much deeper importance as suddenly we all find ourselves obsessing over germ transmission. 
The feature inadvertently joins a number of other COVID-19-related initiatives from Apple introduced over the past several months. The company has donated masks and built face shields and been a key player in contact-tracing initiatives.

On the Watch front specifically, it has opened remote usage for doctors looking to monitor patients ECG readings without risking exposure to the virus for either party. Apple currently makes no claims about the Watchs potential for helping to diagnose the virus, however. While we havent studied specifically how Apple Watch can track COVID, were happy to support the research the medical community is doing. We really support their initiatives by enabling our colleagues in the space, and were excited to see what they learn,” Apples VP of Health, Sumbul Ahmad Desai, tells TechCrunch. 
The company doesnt have anything specific to share on that front, at the moment, but its easy to see how researchers would be interested in leveraging such a widely used wearable in the detection and diagnoses of such a viral and deadly disease. Back in May, Fitbit announced that it was in the early stages of working with researchers on precisely that."

San Francisco-based Elektra Labs was co-founded by a former official at the Food and Drug Administration and a Harvard-trained physician working at Massachusetts General Hospital, to provide clear and accurate assessments of the security, validity, and viability of new biosensors coming to market.
The company said that it will now make its assessments of medical devices that are pitching symptom monitoring technologies for COVID-19 available for free to clinicians and researchers.
As the number of infected people in the US reaches 2.5 million and the nightmare scenario that health experts warned about becomes a reality with capacity in hospitals overwhelmed by sick patients, the healthcare industry is turning to digital services like telemedicine not because they want to, but because they must.
The ability to reliably assess patients vital signs remotely is a powerful way to improve the utility of telemedicine, said Elektra Labs co-founder Dr. Sofia Warner, who has been treating COVID-19 patients on the front line at Massachusetts General Hospital, in a statement. Having a sense of what connected sensors are validated for which measurements is important for providers to know. 
Digital monitoring and technology tools aren’t just for treating patients. The pharmaceutical industry is using the same tech to help with clinical trials to test new drugs and treatments since in-person trials have ground to a halt.
Many pharmaceutical companies running large, critical, and expensive clinical trials are quickly working to adapt their studies to maintain progress and keep patients safe amid the pandemic, said Ariel Stern, PhD, faculty at the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Sciences, in a statement. These companies are racing to determine which products are not only safe and effective, but also easy for study participants to deploy at home.
Elektra Labs has developed what amounts to a nutrition label for objective measures around the validation, usability, utility, security and data governance components of connected sensor and it actually published the methodology behind its scoring framework in Nature Digital Medicine earlier this year. 
Backed by venture capital firms including Founder Collective, Boost VC, Lux Capital, Maverick Ventures, Village Global and Arkitekt Ventures, the early stage startup has already found a welcome reception among pharmaceutical companies and researchers.
Technology has moved faster than our ability to safeguard ourselves, said Elektra Labs CEO Andy Coravos. I co-founded Elektra to make it easier and safer to care for people at home, and never has this been more important than during the COVID-19 crisis. Im thrilled to donate use of the Atlas platform to those working to treat patients and innovate in healthcare throughout the pandemic.
Unlike Apple’s initiative to label apps in the app store based on the way they use and reuse personal data, Elektra Labs’ scoring and ranking information won’t be available to everyone.
Instead the data will be available only to clinicians moving to virtual care, researchers organizing decentralized clinical trials and public health officials examining tools for population health monitoring.
The idea is to enable doctors and researchers to determine which biometric monitoring tools they might use to supplement video visits or track patients in a study actually are safe and effective for patients to use at home."

The investment, which gives Amazon a 16% stake in Deliveroo, is now being opened up to views and feedback from interested parties one more time, due by July 10, before announcing its final decision on August 6.
“This decision reflects the 16% shareholding that Amazon is acquiring at the present time,” the CMA notes. “Were Amazon to acquire a greater level of control over Deliveroo, in particular by making a full acquisition of the company, this could trigger a further investigation by the CMA.”
The deal comes about two months after the CMA initially indicated that it would be giving a nod to the investment, although — in a weird twist — in that period the reasons for approving it have changed.
Back in April, the CMA said that the impact of COVID-19 would have meant that without Amazon’s cash, Deliveroo would have gone bust. Now, however, it has changed its tune, saying that the impact was not as strong as initially thought on the startup’s business. Regardless, Stuart McIntosh, who chaired the CMA’s inquiry into the deal, noted other developments in the wider competitive landscape — remember that JustEat and Takeaway.com have now merged and will represent strong competition for Deliveroo and Uber Eats, the other big player — have meant that this deal will not have a negative effect on the food delivery market overall, including competition between Deliveroo and Amazon themselves.
“The impact of the coronavirus pandemic, while initially extremely challenging, has not been as severe for Deliveroo as was anticipated when we reached our initial provisional findings in April,” he noted. “The updated evidence no longer shows that Deliveroo would exit the market in the absence of this transaction. This has required us to re-evaluate our initial provisional findings.
“Weve carefully considered how this investment could affect competition between the two businesses in future. Looking closely at the size of the shareholding and how it will affect Amazons incentives, as well as the competition that the businesses will continue to face in food delivery and convenience groceries, weve found that the investment should not have a negative impact on customers.”
The development caps off nearly a year of investigations by the Competition and Markets Authority, spurred initially by Labour MP Tom Watson, who had asked the CMA to either impose restrictions on the deal, or to block it outright, not just because of the impact it would have on the competitive landscape, but because of the trove of data Amazon would amass as a result of the deal,.
Its called surveillance capitalism, he said at the time of Amazons approach to how it uses data from customers to build and sell products. Its a digital dystopia, and I shall be writing to the Competition and Markets Authority demanding they launch an investigation into this investment.
The CMA then spent months looking into the numbers on the deal — which would have been Amazon’s only foray itself into ready-made food delivery in the UK, after it shut down its own homegrown effort, Amazon Restaurants, back in 2018 (around the time that it first started eyeing up Deliveroo). But that investigation took on several more twists in the last few months.
The first twist came in the form of COVID-19, which brought much of the economy to a grinding halt. While many have seen e-commerce and the sub-section of food delivery as two areas that could flourish — since people were significantly homebound and restaurants were closed — it appeared that in fact business seemed to be dragging, as people opted to reduce exposure even to contactless deliveries, leading to a big decline in demand.
That led the CMA to determine that “Deliveroo would have exited the market without [the Amazon investment], because of the negative impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on its business. The CMA considered that the imminent exit of Deliveroo would have been worse for competition than allowing the Amazon investment to proceed.”
However, Deliveroo made cuts (including 15% of staff) and on a closer examination, “Deliveroos finances shows considerable improvement in its financial position, reflecting, in part, changes which were not foreseeable during the early stages of the pandemic,” the CMA noted. This means that no Amazon deal would not have killed the company, so then attention turned to competition between the two businesses as a result of the investment.
It said it surveyed 3,000 consumers, read submissions from third parties and examined internal documents from the two companies, and without going into detail of what kind of competition might ever exist in future between the two — especially considering that Amazon has already pulled out of food delivery in the UK — determined that a deal wouldn’t preclude it, based on Deliveroo’s interest in restaurant food delivery and Amazon’s existing business in grocery delivery, which in the UK currently includes both Amazon Fresh and a small Whole Foods footprint, but could potentially expand into more.
More to come."

The app, called NHS COVID-19, is being fast tracked for public use — with a test ongoing this week in the Isle of Wight. It’s set to use Bluetooth Low Energy signals to log social interactions between users to try to automate some contacts tracing based on an algorithmic assessment of users’ infection risk.
The NHSX has said the app could be ready for launch within a matter of weeks but the committee says key choices related to the system architecture create huge risks for people’s rights that demand the safeguard of primary legislation.
Assurances from Ministers about privacy are not enough. The Government has given assurances about protection of privacy so they should have no objection to those assurances being enshrined in law,” said committee chair, Harriet Harman MP, in a statement.
“The contact tracing app involves unprecedented data gathering. There must be robust legal protection for individuals about what that data will be used for, who will have access to it and how it will be safeguarded from hacking.
“Parliament was able quickly to agree to give the Government sweeping powers. It is perfectly possible for parliament to do the same for legislation to protect privacy.
The NHSX, a digital arm of the country’s National Health Service, is in the process of testing the app — which it’s said could be launched nationally within a few weeks.
The government has opted for a system design that will centralize large amounts of social graph data when users experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (or who have had a formal diagnosis) choose to upload their proximity logs.
Earlier this week we reported on one of the committee hearings — when it took testimony from NHSX CEO Matthew Gould and the UK’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, among other witnesses.
Warning now over a lack of parliamentary scrutiny — around what it describes as an unprecedented expansion of state surveillance — the committee report calls for primary legislation to ensure “necessary legal clarity and certainty as to how data gathered could be used, stored and disposed of”. 
The committee also wants to see an independent body set up to carry out oversight monitoring and guard against ‘mission creep’ — a concern that’s also been raised by a number of UK privacy and security experts in an open letter late last month.
“A Digital Contact Tracing Human Rights Commissioner should be responsible for oversight and they should be able to deal with complaints from the Public and report to Parliament,” the committee suggests.
Prior to publishing its report, the committee wrote to health minister Matt Hancock, raising a full spectrum of concerns — receiving a letter in response.
In this letter, dated May 4, Hancock told it: “We do not consider that legislation is necessary in order to build and deliver the contact tracing app. It is consistent with the powers of, and duties imposed on, the Secretary of State at a time of national crisis in the interests of protecting public health.”
The committee’s view is Hancock’s ‘letter of assurance’ is not enough given the huge risks attached to the state tracking citizens’ social graph data.
“The current data protection framework is contained in a number of different documents and it is nearly impossible for the public to understand what it means for their data which may be collected by the digital contact tracing system. Governments assurances around data protection and privacy standards will not carry any weight unless the Government is prepared to enshrine these assurances in legislation,” it writes in the report, calling for a bill that it says myst include include a number of “provisions and protections”.
Among the protections the committee is calling for are limits on who has access to data and for what purpose.
“Data held centrally may not be accessed or processed without specific statutory authorisation, for the purpose of combatting Covid-19 and provided adequate security protections are in place for any systems on which this data may be processed,” it urges.
It also wants legal protections against data reconstruction — by different pieces of data being combined “to reconstruct information about an individual”.
The report takes a very strong line — warning that no app should be released without “strong protections and guarantees” on “efficacy and proportionality”.
“Without clear efficacy and benefits of the app, the level of data being collected will be not be justifiable and it will therefore fall foul of data protection law and human rights protections,” says the committee.
The report also calls for regular reviews of the app — looking at efficacy; data safety; and “how privacy is being protected in the use of any such data”.
It also makes a blanket call for transparency, with the committee writing that the government and health authorities “must at all times be transparent about how the app, and data collected through it, is being used”.
A lack of transparency around the project was another of the concerns raised by the 177 academics who signed the open letter last month.
The government has committed to publishing data protection impact assessments for the app. But the ICO’s Denham still hadn’t had sight of this document as of this Monday.
Another call by the committee is for a time-limit to be attached to any data gathered by or generated via the app. “Any digital contact tracing (and data associated with it) must be permanently deleted when no longer required and in any event may not be kept beyond the duration of the public health emergency,” it writes.
We’ve reached out to the Department of Health and NHSX for comment on the human rights committee’s report.
There’s another element to this fast moving story: Yesterday the Financial Timesreported that the NHSX has inked a new contract with an IT supplier which suggests it might be looking to change the app architecture — moving away from a centralized database to a decentralized system for contacts tracing. Although NHSX has not confirmed any such switch at this point.
Some other countries have reversed course in their choice of app architecture after running into technical challenges related to Bluetooth. The need to ensure public trust in the system was also cited by Germany for switching to a decentralized model.
The human rights committee report highlights a specific app efficacy issue of relevance to the UK, which it points out is also linked to these system architecture choices, noting that: “The Republic of Ireland has elected to use a decentralised app and if a centralised app is in use in Northern Ireland, there are risks that the two systems will not be interoperable which would be most unfortunate.”"

Some epidemiologists have estimated that COVID-19 cases will peak in April, but PitchBook reports that dealmaking was down -26% in March, compared to February’s weekly average. The decline is likely to continue in coming weeks many of the deals that closed last month were initiated before the pandemic, and there is a lag between when deals are made and when they are announced.
However, theres still hope. A recent report concluded that because valuations are lower and there’s less competition for deals, the best-performing vintages tend to be those that invest at the nadir of a downturn and into the early stage of recovery.” There are countless examples from the 2008 recession, including many highly valued VC-backed businesses such as WhatsApp, Venmo, Groupon, Uber, Slack and Square. Other early-stage VCs seem to have arrived at a similar conclusion.
Also, early-stage investing seems more resilient. During the last recession, angel and seed activity increased 34% as interest in the stage boomed during a period of prolonged growth.
Furthermore, there is still capital to be deployed in categories that interested investors before the pandemic, which may set the new order in a post-COVID-19 world. According to data provider Preqin Ltd., VC dry powder rose for a seventh consecutive year to roughly $276 billion in 2019, and another $21 billion were raised last quarter. And looking at the deals on the early-stage side that were made year to date, especially in March, the vertical categories that garnered the most funding were enterprise SaaS, fintech, life sciences, healthcare IT, edtech and cybersecurity.

Around three-quarters of U.S. adults 18 and up said their routines have been impacted due to COVID-19 and their media habits have changed as a result. Since the outbreak, 35% of U.S. smart speakers owners say they’re listening to more news and information through their device, and 36% say they’ve increased their consumption of music and entertainment.
These figures skew even higher when looking at the 18-34 age group.
Here, 50% report an increase in news and information consumption and 52% said they’ve increased their listening of music and other sorts of entertainment.
In addition, the report found the total time spent listening to news content via the smart speaker has increased since the same time last year. In Spring 2019, 30% said listened to 3 or more hours per week, 40% said 1 to less than 3 hours, and 30% said less than one hour.
In the quarantine-fueled Spring 2020, these numbers increased to 32% (3+ hrs.), 43% (1 to &lt;3 hrs.), and 25%(&lt;1 hr), respectively.
Smart speaker owners working from home during the COVID-19 outbreak were also more likely than smart speaker owners in general to make requests for news from their device on a weekly basis, but not as likely to ask for the weather, the time, or other updates.
In the work-from-home group, 65% said they use the device — at some point — to listen to the news while 62% of all smart speaker owners said they do.
Quarantined adults may also help to drive increased sales of smart speakers as they realize the value in spreading out the devices in the home.
A large number of smart speaker owners who have children said they’re now thinking of buying another device to entertain their kids.
Last spring, only 47% said they were thinking of buying a new device for the kids. Now, it’s 71%.
The data in the report referencing the changes after COVID-19 comes from a survey that took place from March 31 through April 1, 2020, the organizations said.
“With tens of millions of Americans no longer commuting, smart speakers are becoming even more important as a conduit for news and information,” said Edison Research SVP Tom Webster, in a release, “and this increased usage and facility with voice assistants will likely increase demand for this technology in vehicles once our commutes resume.” he said.
The report also claimed that smart speaker adoption among U.S. adults has now reached 24% of the U.S. population, or 60 million users. This is a more conservative estimate than another recent report on smart speaker adoption from Voicebot.ai, which said one-third of U.S. adults have a smart speaker, or 87.7 million.
The further report examined other smart speaker trends, unrelated to COVID-19, including the use of smart devices with a screen and voice assistants on phones."

Facebook launched a symptom tracking partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi epidemiological research center early this month, and now the company now plans to expand the project outside of the U.S. In early April, Facebook began prompting some users in the U.S. with a CMU survey asking them to self-report COVID-19 symptoms. The effort is designed to help governments and health officials to predict where the virus could hit next.
Facebook will work with researchers from the University of Maryland on the expansion as the team at CMU’s Delphi develops an API that would allow any researcher to tap into the dataset.
Facebook is also collecting survey data onto its own symptom map, which visualizes the percentage of the population with COVID-19 symptoms by county and hospital referral region. The map also displays flu activity distinct from reported COVID-19 symptoms. With testing capacity still limited in many places, this kind of survey effort seeks to provide a more anticipatory picture of the virus and where it might be spreading next.
“The real-time estimates weve derived correlate with the best available data on COVID-19 activity, which gives us confidence that we may soon be able to give health care officials forecasts of disease activity that is likely to occur in their localities several weeks into the future,” Ryan Tibshirani, co-lead on Carnegie Mellon Universitys Delphi COVID-19 Response Team, said in a statement.
The opt-in CMU survey asks Facebook users if they were experiencing coughing, fever, shortness or breath or loss of smellsymptoms that can show up in COVID-19 patients in more mild forms and that likely would be present prior to an individual seeking treatment and thus being tracked by healthcare systems.
CMU published its initial findings on Monday, which show the data collected on Facebook correlates with existing COVID-19 public health data. The research team is introducing a tool called COVIDcast, which collects aggregated data about COVID-19 activity, sorted by geographic area. Google has also joined CMU’s research effort and later this week the COVIDcast will integrate data from both Facebook and Google survey responses. So far, the project has collected nearly one million responses each week on Facebook and 600,000 through Google’s Opinion Rewards and AdMob apps.

“Getting accurate county-by-county data from across the United States is challenging, and obtaining such focused data from across the whole world is even harder” Zuckerberg wrote, adding that Facebook is “uniquely” suited to aid research efforts that require surveying large subsets of the population.
After a long season of criticism, social media companies are striving for relevance in the fight against the virus. Facebook, particularly dogged by negative press and privacy scandals in recent years, was early to add UI elements promoting COVID-19 information from health experts on its platform. Still, Facebook and other social networks remain plagued by coronavirus misinformation, scammers and conspiracies, which spread quickly and have proven difficult for companies to stamp out.
Last week, a handful of U.S. anti-government protests organized on Facebook and promoted by President Trump defied the advice of state governments and public health officials, calling users to gather in publican act of defiance that could potentially spread the virus to new communities in spite of the best efforts by state governments to protect their residents."

The $10 million award also includes Apple employing its sourcing resources to find equipment and materials for COPAN Diagnostics, including new advanced equipment the iPhone-maker is helping design itself. Funds will also be used by COPAN to expand to a larger production facility in Southern California that can output more supply, growing its run rate from around several thousand currently, to over one million kits weekly by July, according to Apple. Apple notes that it will also result in the creation of around 50 new U.S. jobs.
COPAN is a pioneer in the diagnostics world, having previously invented flocked swabs in 2003, and it currently offers the world’s leading transport medium for virus-containing clinical specimens. The investment here from Apple is focused primarily on scale, taking the existing expertise of COPAN and making it into something that can operate somewhere closer to the amazing production volumes that Apple can accomplish, in order to help address the urgent need for more testing supplies to prevent that being the bottleneck to widespread COVID-19 diagnostics in the U.S.
Apple has redirected many of its resources, including monetary donations, protective equipment sourcing, and software development resources for both symptom-checking apps and the forthcoming partnership with Google on exposure notification software, to combatting the global coronavirus crisis. This deployment of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund is yet another example of how the company can address the pandemic in a variety of ways that are unique to its global position, expertise and relationships."

One kid, per our commenters, said Scotts performance was better than Star Wars.
The popular multiplayer game Fortnite, owned by Epic Games, is just one example of tech finding a creative way to continue business as usual amid this pandemic. And it got extra points for being psychedelic.
Lets get into other tech companies working hard to do good during COVID-19.
Under my umbrella
Umbrella, a startup that provides services to seniors, is now recruiting thousands of volunteers to deliver essential items to the elderly that cant leave their homes due to shelter-in-place orders. The deliveries include contact-free groceries and prescriptions.The New York-based startup connects seniors with local providers, but in response to the coronavirus outbreak it waived its annual membership fee and began a volunteer platform to connect seniors to local volunteers. The company recently landed a partnership with Venture for America to expand this volunteer effort. 
Mental health for nurses
Trusted Health, which connects nurses to jobs and career resources, partnered with The College of Nursing at The Ohio State University to create a program focused on mental health and well-being of nurses on the frontlines right now. In the last six weeks, over 400,000 nurses signed up. The program kicked off with a mental wellness hotline and a wellness partner program that includes four to eight weeks of hands-on coaching and therapy. 
Live captioning during science class
Remote education is no joke, especially when it looks like more of a scramble than a stroll. Rev.com, a voice-to-text service, is providing its transcription services for free to K-12 educators. In a statement the company said that the live-captioning can be integrated into Zoom, and could assist students who struggle with English as a second language. The service is free for the remainder of the school year. 
Coaching for first-generation and low income students
For many low-income and first-generation students, school closures threaten much more than their spring break plans. Thousands of students now have to find a new source of food, housing and employment. Some cant return to their homes because flights are either unsafe or too expensive. So Beyond 12, a nonprofit organization that focuses on college completion, is raising funds to start COVID-19 Virtual College Coaching Corps. The support program will focus on the emotional, social and academic support for students at risk for not graduating. The company says that in the past two weeks it raised $300K, and is now looking to hire 20 new coaches and reach 20,000 students. 
Isolated? Youre not alone
Astra Labs, a nonprofit software company, has created a website to help people cope with the impact of COVID-19: Isolatednotalone.com. Its a bit different from the other efforts weve seen to connect people to hotlines and CDC guidelines. Instead, this site answers the hard questions that arise from the pandemic: I just found out a loved one died from COVID-19, what can I do next? What are the options for a funeral? What happens if they die at home? What should my next steps be? 
Contact-less solution for restaurants, for free
For customers that phone in takeout orders, the ol credit card exchange and pen sign still exists when they get to the restaurant (and so do the existing germs). To skip sharing screens and pens, San Francisco-based CardFree, which was founded in 2012, is giving three months of its mobile and online ordering software to restaurants for free. The deal is for small and medium-sized businesses, and CardFree says the software cuts out the middleman of third-party delivery apps. 
Calling all science influencers of Instagram
Seed, a Venice-based startup that creates science-based probiotics, has launched a free science course taught via Instagram. The venture capital-backed company is teaching about a confusing subject that is now more important than ever: how microbes work amid COVID-19. The course is six weeks. 
Spoon-fed goodness
Little Spoon, a direct-to-consumer baby food company backed by Serena Williams, is providing free or discounted meals to parents struggling to feed their kids. The company has donated $100,000 in Little Spoon meals to Feeding America food banks, and is providing discounts to healthcare workers. Little Spoon is also partnering with employers to provide healthy and affordable kids meals to their employees children.
A forum for feelings
We all have a lot of up and down feelings these days that might not fit into 280 characters or work in our Slack groups. Now&amp;Me created a discussion forum for people to share their highs and lows with others, with the option to post anonymously. The co-founder of Now&amp;Me, Drishti Gupta, says that we believe that feeling better starts with knowing it’s okay to not be okay.
Crowd-sourced map to feed people
The pandemic has stress-tested food insecurity and the hunger crisis around the world. WhyHunger, a charity focused on the human right to nutritious food, partnered with 10x management and its software team to create an interactive map of free meal sites across the United States. Software engineers Greg Sadetsky and Colin Wren helped create the crowd-sourced and open sourced map."

The test is an at-home collection kit, which provides sample collection materials including a nasal swab to the user, who then uses the included shipping package to return the sample to a lab for testing.
Until now, the FDA has not authorized any at-home testing or sample collection kits for use, and in fact clarified its guidelines to specifically note that their use was not authorized under its guidelines when a number of startup companies debuted similar products for at-home collection and round-trip testing with labs already certified to run molecular RT-PCR tests to detect the presence of COVID-19.
The FDA notes that only LabCorp’s COVID-19 RT-PCR test has received this authorization, and that it still requires any such test to have an EUA before they can being offering services, whether or not the test is administered at home with the help of guidance from an authorized medical professional via telemedicine. Some labs facilitating at home serology tests using an exception in the FDA guidelines, but these are not viewed by the agency as tests that can confirm a case of COVID-19.
Opening up at-home testing (even via just sample collection, vs. full at-home test administration) is a big step in terms of a change in the way the agency has operated thus far. The FDA has recently updated its guidelines to note that it is working with at-home test providers to determine the best way to make those available to the public, since it “sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection.”
LabCorp is a U.S. medical diagnostics company with over 40 years of experience, including at-home testing via its Pixel line for colorectal cancer, diabetes, and cardiac lipid conditions. It seems like the FDA is favoring long-standing industry experience in terms of who it’s willing to open up authorizations for with at-home collection, which is likely due to the potential for increased error when you add unsupervised self-collection, packing and logistics into the mix.
Testing for COVID-19 in the U.S. currently relies on drive-through sites, as well as in-clinic and hospital testing. These tests have a high bar for access in terms of risk profile and symptom presentation, and their administration also exposes the healthcare professionals running them to risk of contracting the infection themselves. At-home testing could increase overall testing rates, while decreasing risk to frontline healthcare workers, providing a better picture of the true extent and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic."

The statement, published today, said that Chinese hackers “have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property and public health data related to vaccines, treatments and testing from networks an personnel associated with COVID-19-related research,” it reads.
“China’s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation’s response to COVID-19,” it reads.
Both the FBI and CISA said organizations should bolster their cybersecurity defenses.
The joint statement follows a similar announcement between U.S. and U.K. authorities last week, which warned that hackers are using password spraying a common attack that uses recycled or default passwords to break into systems against healthcare bodies and medical research organizations “that provide medical support services and supplies in a concerted effort to prevent incidents and enable them to focus on their response to COVID-19.”
Research firms and pharmaceutical giants have scrambled to find a vaccine for the COVID-19 strain, which experts have said is likely the only way that strict lockdown restrictions can be lifted across the world.
To date, there have been more than 4.2 million confirmed cases since it was first discovered in December.
U.S. authorities have long accused China of hacking into U.S. systems. Since 2018, Justice Department prosecutors have brought charges against several hackers, said to be working for the Chinese government, for the 2015 Anthem breach, dozens of technology giants and governmental organizations, and more recently Chinese military hackers who stole close to 150 million records from credit giant Equifax.
Beijing has repeatedly denied accusations of hacking.
But China isn’t the only government accused of using its offensive cyber prowess to steal coronavirus research. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Iran-backed hackers targeted U.S. drugmaker Gilead, whose antiviral drug remdesivir is the only treatment that has so far shown to help patients suffering from COVID-19."

Mammoth Biosciences will be using its DETECTR platform to develop the test, which recently received validation through a peer-reviewed study published in Nature.
Already, Mammoth has its DETECTR platform under evaluation by the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and partnering with GSK and its consumer healthcare division sets up Mammoth to potentially scale its development and distribution to widespread commercial and consumer availability. Mammoth and GSK aim to have a COVID-19-specific test based on DETECTR ready for FDA evaluation before the end of this year.
The goal is to make it available first to healthcare facilities in the U.S.. It can provide a lot of advantages vs. current solutions for health facility testing, since it provides results in under 20 minutes and can be conducted fully on site using a nasal swab collected from a patient. It’s also fully disposable, making it more convenient and ultimately safer for healthcare professionals to use.
After that, the partners plan to expand availability, ultimately offering the test direct to consumers for over-the-counter use. The nature of the test means it’s not much more difficult to administer than may other at-home diagnostics, which h could further reduce the risk of transmission for infected individuals and make tests much more accessible and widespread.
Note that this likely won’t happen before at least next year given the current development timeline, but given the nature of the ongoing global pandemic, it definitely seems like we’ll still be interested in expanding testing capabilities as one of our ongoing strategies of mitigating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19."

Today, the San Francisco startup is announcing that it has closed a Series B of $36 million led by Eclipse Ventures, with ICONIQ Capital, Hanaco Ventures, and Floodgate Fund also participating. The funding brings the total raised by Cheetah to $66 million, the company said. PitchBook puts its valuation at its last round at $180 million; we’ve asked for the latest figure and will update as and when we hear more.
Cheetah’s pivot comes at a key moment for the company and points to how there seem to be, generally speaking, two very different narratives underpinning the world of startups at the moment.
On one hand, some companies are seeing a huge boost to their business, when their existing business model perfectly addresses a current need. On the other, companies that are hard pressed to fit any current need are feeling the pinch.
Cheetah is an example of how a company in the latter category has used its resources and pivoted to becoming a business in the former.
Its wholesale delivery business for restaurants — which had some 300 customers before COVID-19, has largely (but not completely) dried up. So it’s now set up a new service called Cheetah For Me, where it offers bakery items to beverages, dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, fresh produce, condiments, snacks and cleaning supplies to individuals to buy, and distributes those orders via a selection of pick-up points.
At a time when people are unable to get delivery slots with Amazon or are avoiding physical grocery stores, Cheetah’s offering becomes another choice alongside Instacart and other food delivery services.
The positive feedback from the community has been overwhelming, said Na’ama Moran, CEO at Cheetah who cofounded the company with Christopher Elliott, Alon Har-Tal and Vincent Matranga, in a statement.This funding allows Cheetah to build on our strong foundation and expand essential services directly to the consumer. Now, we can provide even more people with the food and supplies they need in a safe and cost-effective way, throughout this crisis and beyond. Our purpose has always been to help independent restaurants thrive. Now we are helping communities thrive.
Currently its Cheetah For Me service is live in the Bay Area.
Cheetah is not the only startup that caters to the restaurant trade that is now opening up a new front offering direct-to-consumer sales.
Choco in New York, which helps restaurants source their supplies online to save cooks and buyers time shopping in person, also started a new service targeting consumers. In its case, it’s teaming up with its restaurant customers to resell vegetables, meat and other ingredients.
(Choco doesn’t take a cut itself and says it’s doing this to help the restaurants continue staying in business even when they cannot operate their physical venues and kitchens.)
Choco earlier this month also raised some money: $30.2 million at a $250 million valuation.
Founders have said that’s a challenge right now to raise money, not just because of business slowing down. They cannot see investors in person, and investors themselves are wary and hesitant because they don’t know what the next months will hold.
In that regard, some of the factors are emerging that are critical in sealing the deal. They include showing that the startup is resourceful and useful; and that the startup is based on a good enough idea, executed well, making it worth funding to help it stick around.
It seems that Cheetah ticked all of these boxes.
This pandemic has shed light on how technology can be used to quickly adapt core services within the food industry like delivery, fulfillment, and supply chains,” said Lior Susan, Founder and Managing Partner at Eclipse, in a statement. Cheetahs team has demonstrated agility and ingenuity on behalf of their customers, and the resiliency of building a technology-centric operation. The companys vertical integration and technology stack have enabled them to accommodate changing buyer behavior as food supply chains shifted from a focus on commercial operations to consumer homes.”
“Cheetah’s existing technology infrastructure has enabled them to quickly expand their offering to new customers,” added Sarah Kim, Head of Private Equity Funds and Co-Investments at ICONIQ Capital, in a separate statement. “Cheetah has demonstrated that it has the vision to uncover new opportunities and the ability to rapidly execute on programs that benefit multiple communities. We look forward to working with this talented team as they pave the way toward a better food supply chain.”"

Since then, COVID-19 and the resulting physical distancing measures have created plenty of demand for companies helping to inform and entertain us as we’re stuck at home. At the same time, there’s a dramatic reduction in ad spending, making it harder to monetize that consumer attention.
So we checked in a variety of top VCs about the new landscape, where they’re investing and what kind of advice they’re giving their portfolio companies.
Not all of them invest directly in what (paraphrasing Betaworks’ Matt Hartman) we might call media media the companies whose business models revolve around content creation and advertising but each of these investors are backing startups looking to change the way we stay connected and entertained.
Here’s who we surveyed:

You can’t count on the ad business to recover in the next few months, but there are still opportunities for startups exploring new formats and new business models. And there’s still plenty of excitement about gaming and esports.
You can read their full responses, lightly edited, below.
What (if any) media trends are still exciting you from an investing perspective?
Live and interactive formats, especially shorter form, continue to be very exciting, made even more evident in this time of shelter-in-place. What has worked in China and broader Asia has not yet translated into explosive success in the West. As interesting as celebrity live broadcasts are from their homes, the lack of real interaction and participation features hampers long-term engagement and doesn’t make up for the lack of production quality.
Modern content production technology is needed to push both production and live ops cost down while enabling more interactive and engaging formats. Game engines are one example, there’s of course the Travis Scott concert that just happened in Fortnite built on the Unreal engine, but that 15-minute, pre-rendered show took months to create, we’re only just scratching the surface of what’s possible.
One of our investments in this space is Tellie for live-action formats, another is The Wave for rendered, live formats, and we continue to look for great combinations of tech and media talent innovating on new formats.
Speaking of gaming, multiplayer games continue to grow and grow exponentially, there is a lot to unpack in popular titles from new favorite Animal Crossing to classics like World of Warcraft to indie hits like For the King. They all have social cooperation as a core part of the game loop and design. I’d love to see more teams working on cooperative play and just overall a broader diversity in multiplayer experiences beyond purely competitive ones."

The startup promised a clever approach to dry cleaning that involved setting up robotic kiosks in hotel hallways. The product is aimed at traveling business people looking for a quick clean of rumpled up clothing ahead of an important business meeting. Best of all, it cuts out pricey hotel laundry services. 
Obviously, a lot has changed in late-August, and like many others, the team has attempted to find a way to leverage its technology in the battle against the spread of COVID-19. The solution is a bit more niche than some, but Presso is still a fairly small team. The company has added a disinfecting element to its robot in line with CDC guidelines and has begun selling a limited number of units to TV and film production companies.
“My family in India actually contracted coronavirus and my mom and grandparents had to be hospitalized,” cofounder and CEO Nishant Jain told TechCrunch. “They are all safe now thankfully. If we can play even a small part in keeping clothes sanitized and people safe, we’d be honored. Even our team members have been quite active with helping out their local communities by sourcing masks and PPE for hospitals and designing ventilators.”
The move comes as California governor Gavin Newsom has announced plans to get film production back on track. Many studios are balking at such a rush to return to work, but for those who are still interested, Presso is offering up units for sets looking to remove the potential spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus. 
Pressos latest push is fueled in part by an additional $250,000 in funding, bringing the teams total up to $511,000. The company says its seen a 200% growth in orders from one month to the next, including high profile clients like Disney/Marvel, HBO, CBS an FOX."

After all, everyone is stuck at home and understandably more willing to shop online instead of at a traditional retailer to avoid putting themselves and others at medical risk. But the truth is, most smaller online stores have seen better days.
The primary challenge is that smaller shops often dont have the logistics networks that companies like Amazon do. Consequently, theyre seeing substantially delayed delivery timelines, especially if they ship internationally. Customers obviously arent thrilled about that reality. And in many cases, theyre requesting refunds at a staggering rate.
I saw this play out firsthand in April. At that point, my stores were down 20% or in some cases even 30% in revenue. Needless to say, my team was freaking out. But theres one thing we did that helped us increase our revenue over 200% since the pandemic, decrease refund requests and even strengthen our existing customer relationships.
We implemented a 24-hour live chat in all of our stores. Heres why it worked for us and why every digital brand should be doing it too.
When I started my first online store in 2006, challenges that bogged my team down often meant that my teams first priority became resolving those challenges so that we could serve our customers faster. But admittedly, when these challenges came up, it became more difficult to balance communicating with our customers and resolving the issues that prevented us from fulfilling their orders quickly."

The automaker is expected to resume production and some operations at its North America facilities May 18. Aside from factory workers, Ford is also bringing back about 12,000 employees whose jobs cannot be done remotely such as vehicle testing and design. The company’s parts distribution centers reopened in North America on May 11.
Ford said it will initially use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which identifies if someone is actively infected. PCR tests are used to detect the presence of viral RNA, not the presence of the antibodies, which are the body’s immune response.
The automaker said it has signed contracts with health systems to conduct the testing. Ford will work with Beaumont Health for testing in Southeast Michigan, the University of Louisville Health in Louisville, Liberty Hospital in the Kansas City area and the University of Chicago Medical Center and UChicago Medicine-Ingalls Memorial Hospital in the Chicago area.
Collectively, Ford employs more than 72,000 people in Southeast Michigan, Louisville, Kansas City and Chicago.
The contracts will enable Ford to test employees with suspected symptoms with a goal of getting results back within 24 hours, according to the automaker’s medical director Dr. Walter Talamonti.
Testing results will be simultaneously shared with Ford doctors to help identify other employees who might have been in close contact with an infected worker. Those employees will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.
The company is working on expanding testing, Ford CTO Ken Washington said in a statement. Washington added that Ford is looking into voluntary antibody testing in the future for its employees.
Ford released May 1 a back-to-work playbook that describes the protocols that it will put in place once production at its factories resume. Employees will have to complete a self-certification health check daily and have their temperature scanned upon arrival to any Ford facility. Face masks will also be required. Safety glasses with side shields or face shields will be required when jobs don’t allow for social distancing."

Among them is Branch, a 1.5-year-old, venture-backed New York-based startup that sells what it calls “exceptional office furniture, at half the price” — and which nearly went kaput because of the pandemic.
After generating roughly $800,000 in revenue in the first weeks of March, that number promptly fell to zero as people were asked to leave their offices and head home.
A small layoff at Branch followed — its 11-person team shrank to 8 people — along with some panic. Instead of throw in the towel, the startup retooled itself to sell home office furniture to the many employees who are now working from home and receiving a stipend to update their set-up.
The decision might just save the business. According to cofounder and CEO Greg Hayes, Branch is now selling directly to individuals, as well as working with Google, Shopify and other companies to outfit home offices for employees who may never work in an office five days a week again.
The startup already had some advantages over many more traditional office furniture retailers. Because it doesn’t work with middlemen, as do many high-end businesses like Herman Miller, it claims it can better compete on price. Hayes, who was previously head of portfolio strategy at the New York-based startup Breather, says Branch can “create 90% of the quality of best-in-class furniture for 30% of the price.”
From the start, the company has also promised much faster delivery than some of its rivals — think one to three weeks, instead of two or three months.
The reason, says Hayes, is process. While many incumbents have practices that can involve customizing parts and finishes specific to a transaction, made-to-order items can take a long time. That’s probably fine with companies that plan to occupy a space for five to 10 years and want things just right. Meanwhile, Branch’s pitch is to companies that prefer speed and flexibility and so don’t mind choosing from a smaller number of modular items — many components of which are the same throughout different products.
Indeed, speed and price are things that continue to appeal to companies no matter where their employees are.
You can imagine that they are proving important to people who are more newly working from home and do not have stipends, too — which is what has Hayes feeling optimistic about Branch’s prospects after its near-death experience.
“You never want to go through something like this [pandemic], but in a weird way, it has opened up a business that we wouldn’t have focused on, which is direct to consumer.”
The startup — which just this week began selling standing partitions to accommodate new office layouts —  can’t always assemble its items for its corporate and other customers as it once did uniformly. (Some are right now eschewing Branch’s “white glove service” and putting together their own desks and chairs out of an abundance of caution.)
But Branch says its manufacturing partners — two in the U.S. and three in China — are nonetheless being kept busy at the moment. In fact, Hayes says business is suddenly so brisk that the company’s most popular chair — a $279 ergonomic number —  won’t be available again until September. They can’t make it fast enough.
It’s a problem for a company that promises speedy service. But it’s one Hayes will happily take over the alternative. “Offices aren’t going away, but working from home isn’t going to be frowned upon anymore. ” Instead, he says, “A lot of white-collar employees will be working from the office just two days a week.
That Branch. can “now sell them two chairs has, strangely, been a gift to our own employees.”"

These are the drugs that Trump famously touted as effective in COVID-19 treatment, despite major concerns raised with the scientific validity of early medical investigations that showed they were potentially effective agains the infection beyond the ongoing global pandemic.
Subsequent studies showed conflicting results, including when one team of researchers ended elements of its clinical study into the drugs’ use early due to excess fatalities. The FDA had issued its EUA for use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in late March, prompting criticism from many in the medical and pharmaceutical research community since evidence seemed very mixed in terms of its potential efficacy and risks. Then following those deaths in that subsequent clinical study, it issued a statement of precaution regarding the use of the drugs.
The FDA grants EUAs in circumstances where it deems the benefits outweigh the risks of expediting a provisional authorization for the use of therapies and devices that haven’t undergone its full, rigorous approval process for drugs and equipment. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the FDA releasing many more EUAs than is typical, especially as it pertains to testing equipment used for diagnostic of the infection and SARS-CoV-19, its preceding and causal virus.
Trump irresponsibly touted the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and later professed to be taking the medicine himself as a precaution he wrongly believed would stave off infection. The drug’s supply subsequently experienced a number of stresses due to increased demand, which had potentially dire consequences for people with a legitimate need for its consumption due to conditions for which it is approved and clinical shown to be effective, including lupus and chronic arthritis."

The company got a $13 million grant from BARDA in March to help it scale its development and deployment of rapid diagnostics, and its COVID-19 test is obviously a key focus of that effort given the current global pandemic.
Cue’s test is portable, and uses an RNA detection method to confirm the presence of the actual virus in a patient’s system using nasal swab samples. The company says that it can provide results in as little as 25 minutes, and it’s relatively simple to administer, both factors that make it potentially very useful in efforts to scale COVID-19 testing as the pandemic and its ensuing global health crisis continues.
The Cue Health test comes as a kit that includes the sample collection wand, along with a test cartridge. The cartridge connects to an app on a smartphone and transmits the diagnostic results to that device. Under the terms of the EUA granted by the FDA, the Cue test can be administered anywhere, so long as it’s done under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. Cue says it’s seeking additional authorizations from the FDA to expand use of the test to include allowing it to be done in settings including workplaces, schools and even in-home use.
To start, Cue Health’s COVID-19 test will be rolling out in partnership with “leading healthcare institutions,” according to the company, and then from there the plan is to expand it to a number of additional healthcare facility settings. Ultimately, Cue’s goal is to create a range of molecular diagnostic testing solutions for not only COVID-19, but also influenza and other viruses, with the ability to flexibly deploy and conduct them in basically any setting where they’re needed."

The iOS app will allow users to ask questions and then use in-app points to make predictions about what might happen in the future. Users can also create, discuss and view these crowdsourced predictions.
At launch, only invited participants in the U.S. and Canada will be allowed to make predictions and engage in conversations, while the app is in beta testing. But these predictions and related discussions will be publicly accessible on the Forecast website and made shareable.
Before today, Facebook tested the product internally with a small set of employees. Their initial forecasts will form the initial core content in the app at launch.
Starting now, Facebook will invite members of the health, research and academic communities to make predictions about the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the world.
At a time when Facebook and other major tech platforms are under fire for their role in aiding the spread of misinformation, fake news, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and other non-factual content presented as truth, an app focused on making “guesses” about the future seems ill-advised — however educated those guesses may be. This is particularly concerning because much of the app’s content will focus on guesses about COVID-19.
Forecast’s predictions may help show what people are thinking, but COVID-19 isn’t a game. To understand the world, scientists form a hypothesis, which is essentially an expanded form of an educated guess. But they don’t then crowdsource voting to determine if a hypothesis is true — they test, experiment, gather supporting data, try to prove and disprove the hypothesis, and ultimately aim to publish their findings and have them peer-reviewed.
The Forecast app turns the hypothesis into the end result, in a way. The app lets users make a forecast and explain their reasoning — in other words, form a hypothesis. But instead of doing the work to test the forecast, through the application of the scientific method, Forecast will track the votes a given question receives.
E.g. “When will the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate begin phase 3 trials?” or “When will most U.S. residents be treated with a COVID-19 vaccine?”
Questions will be reviewed by the Forecast team and edited for clarity, if needed. Users will be notified if their question is published.
At some point, the question will be determined as “settled,” based on an elapsed time period or because an event has occurred. For instance, if users were guessing when a vaccine would be released, and then it’s actually released, the questions around that topics would be settled.
Forecast’s polls are given aesthetically pleasing charts and graphs which can be shared outside the app. That means users could start posting these guesses and the crowdsourced responses to sites like Facebook, where the line between fact and fiction has already blurred. That could further complicate people’s understanding of what is already a complex topic: the COVID-19 pandemic. Facebook users who see these shared “forecasts” may believe they have some basis in science and research, when instead, they are the result of a social networking app.
Of course, there is some fun in betting on world events and seeing if they turn out to be true, and there is even some value in organizing a wider community’s collective “best guesses” about a future event to gain an understanding of what people are thinking at a given time. But spreading out predictions to Facebook seems like an idea that’s fraught with potential problems.
Facebook’s goal here is only to test its own hypothesis — that a standalone, community-based predictions app that rewards a participatory audience with social credit will surface insightful voices and thoughtful discussions.
In the end, however, it seems like Facebook is looking for any angle that could prompt thought leaders to engage in meaningful discussions about subjects they know best on a Facebook platform. These sorts of discussions are difficult to have in Facebook’s comments section around a post — as comments are, more often than not, a place people go to troll, argue, threaten and otherwise derail a conversation.
Facebook says the questions in Forecast will be moderated for clarity using Forecast’s own moderation guidelines and Facebook’s Community Standards. That means questions can’t mention death, sexual or violent assault of any individual, including public figures. (This isn’t meant to be some sort of new internet Death Clock, for example.) Hate speech isn’t allowed. Questions around illegal content or those involving personal information also aren’t permitted, along with other guidelines detailed here."

But unlike a simple Instagram Stories’ Q&amp;A session, Capsule provides a full platform for designing the Q&amp;A session, branding the content, curating the responses from users and tracking the resulting data. But the most notable feature is Capsule’s automated editing process that adds branding, effects and music to the final product, allowing brands to skip the post-production process and more quickly publish their video.
The product comes from the same team behind the animated GIF capture tool and social network Phhhoto, which eventually lost out to Instagram’s clone, Boomerang. Following Phhhoto’s shutdown in late 2017, the team pivoted to an experiential marketing business, Hypno, that provided photo booths, plus other camera platforms and interactive experiences, for live events, retail and attractions.
The idea for the new startup directly emerged from the challenges now facing Hypno in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Capsule was born out of the need for some of our events and live experiences customers to figure out a way to activate their audiences because they couldn’t do it in real life,” explains co-founder Champ Bennett. “The Hypno business pretty much dried up in terms of its opportunities as soon as the pandemic hit,” he says.
The team refocused its efforts on the new software platform instead, and received an immediate, overwhelming response from its existing customers. It also quickly added new ones — including those outside the live events space.
In the two months following its MVP launch, Capsule has been generating revenue from its now 35,000 users, including some big-name customers like Netflix, Samsung, Chicago Bulls and a handful of colleges and universities that wanted to create solutions for virtual graduations. Consumers, meanwhile, have also used the product for virtual birthdays, weddings and baby showers.
The platform itself works something like a Squarespace for the video Q&amp;A format.
To use Capsule, the brand will first pick a template that can customize to match their current campaign by changing the logos, colors, buttons, backgrounds and URLs.
Image Credits: Capsule
They then choose their own questions and prompts designed to get their customers/users/community members talking.
To respond, users visit the Capsule URL — which can be a custom domain for an extra fee — to record and upload videos via their phone or laptop. These videos can only be a max of 60 seconds in length to keep the content short and snappy.
Brands can curate the responses they want to use in the resulting product, aka the “capsule.” They’ll also have access to the raw video footage for use elsewhere on social media, if needed.
Capsule’s best trick is that it instantly and automatically processes the video, adding music, lower-third graphics and a pre-roll and a post-roll, so the video looks professionally edited.
“It makes everybody look a little better than what they would normally look like if they were just recording right from their phone — which generally looks pretty raw and unedited,” explains Bennett. “That editing feature is the magic of that whole thing, as it makes it feel really special.”
The automated editing involves a scripting language the Capsule team created, which includes a set of instructions on how to process a given video. Capsule’s customers simply select the “type” of video they want, and Capsule does the rest.
“One might be really energetic, with flashing graphics and pumping music. And one might be a little bit more somber and may have an acoustic guitar playing behind it,” Bennett notes. “Ultimately, what will happen is when you create a Capsule, you’ll be able to pick that that feel.”
Right now, Capsule offers 10 of these “templates,” but is working to have around 50 available within the next couple of months.
Depending on the type of solution a brand needs, Capsule’s service can cost anywhere from $10 per month to as much as $20,000 per year. It currently works via the web and mobile web, but Capsule is developing an iPhone app that will allow the capture of higher-quality video.
While the original focus was to create a new engagement platform for brands that have lost the ability to host live events, the range of post-COVID use cases is continuing to grow. Netflix, for example, ran a focus group using Capsule to ask questions and get video, instead of written responses from viewers. Will Ferrell used Capsule to leave a video message for graduates. Media company OkayAfrica’s community used Capsule to talk about the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, organized in thematic sections.
Bennett says the company is also thinking about how Capsule can be used to provide a platform for people’s voices who may not otherwise be heard.
Following its launch, it’s clear Capsule became a more flexible format than perhaps originally envisioned. But to what extent customers’ usage will change over time remains less certain. If a coronavirus vaccine is developed, for example, the need for video to stand in for live events may not be as in demand as it is now, for example. Of course, no one knows when that time will come at this point.
In addition to Bennett, Capsule’s co-founders include Russell Armand and Joseph Jorgensen, also of Phhhoto and Hypno. The company is planning to spin out Capsule from Hypno and is already receiving inbound interest from investors. Capsule has not closed a seed round at this time."

In an advisory report, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the Russia-linked cyber espionage group commonly known as APT29 — which is also sometimes referred to as the Dukes or Cozy Bear — has targeted various organisations involved in medical R&amp;D and COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the US and the UK throughout 2020.
Per the report, APT29 is using custom malware known as WellMess and WellMail to target a number of organisations globally, including those involved with COVID-19 vaccine development.
WellMess and WellMail have not previously been publicly associated to APT29, it notes.
The NCSC, which is a public facing branch of the UK’s GCHQ intelligence agency, said it believes it “highly likely” that the intention of the malware attacks is to steal information and IP related to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.
The findings in the report are also endorsed by Canadas Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and the US National Security Agency (NSA).
“In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organisations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified,” the advisory adds.
It concludes by assessing APT29 is “likely” to continue to target organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine R&amp;D — as “they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic”.
“It is strongly recommended that organisations use the rules and IOCs [indicators of compromise] in the [report] appendix in order to detect the activity detailed in this advisory,” it adds, flagging compromise indicators and detection and mitigation advice contained in the document.
Responding to the advisory the UK government condemned what it called Russia’s “irresponsible” cyber attacks against COVID-19 vaccine development.
“It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” said foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a statement. “While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.”
“The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account,” he added.
Last month EU lawmakers named Russia and China as states behind major disinformation campaigns related to the coronavirus which they said had targeted Internet users in the region.
The European Commission is working on a pan-EU approach to tackling the spread of damaging falsehoods online.
The NCSC advisory follows hard on the heels of an assertion by Raab that Russia attempted to influence the 2019 UK election via the online amplification of leaked documents.
On the basis of extensive analysis, the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents, Raab said in a statement yesterday.
The Guardian reports that UK intelligence agencies have spent months investigating how a 451-page dossier of official emails ended up with the opposition Labour party during the election campaign — providing an opportunity for then leader Jeremy Corbyn to make political capital out of details related to UK-US trade talks.
Back in 2017 former UK and Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, also warned publicly that Russia was trying to meddle in Western elections. However she failed to act on a series of recommendations from a parliamentary committee that scrutinized the democratic threats posed by online disinformation.
The timing of this latest flurry of Russian cyberops warnings from UK state sources is especially interesting in light of a much delayed report by the UK parliament’s Intelligence &amp; Security Committee (ISC) into Russia’s role in election interference.
Publication of this report was blocked last year on orders of prime minister, Boris Johnson. But, this week, an attempt by Number 10 to install Chris Grayling, a former secretary of state for transport, as chair of the ISC was thwarted after Conservative MP Julian Lewis sided with opposition MPs to vote for himself as new committee chair instead.
Publication of the long delayed Russia report is now imminent, after the committee voted unanimously for it to be released next week before parliament breaks for the summer.
Last NovemberThe Guardian newspaper reported that the dossier examines allegations Russian money has flowed into British politics in general and to the Conservative party in particular; as well as looking into claims Russia launched a major influence operation in 2016 in support of Brexit.
In 2017, under pressure from the DCMS committee, Facebook admitted Russian agents had used its platform to try to interfere in the UKs referendum on EU membership though it claimed not to have found “significant coordination” of ad buys or political misinformation targeting the Brexit vote.
Last year, former ISC chair, Dominic Grieve, called for the Russia report to be published before election day — saying it contained knowledge “germane” to voters.
Instead, Johnson blocked publication — going on to be elected with a huge Conservative majority."

Famously, Londons DeepMind, an AI startup, was acquired by Google in 2014 for $500 million, but it has resolutely refused to move to Silicon Valley; founder Demis Hassabis says the city’s diversity of talent meant the powerhouse needed to stay put.
London has produced fintech upstarts like Revolut, Monzo and Starling and attracted early Skype team members who went on to create TransferWise. In 2019, London’s startups received $9.7 billion in venture capital funding, more than Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid combined.
Furthermore, last year Pitchbook found that up to $4.4 billion worth of deals had involved at least one U.S.-based investor, with London receiving over $12.5 billion from American investors in the previous five years almost twice as much as Berlin (on $6.5 billion of investment from U.S. VC firms).
Brexit uncertainty may impact startups ability to recruit and sale, and the UK governments points-based system for immigration is unlikely to satisfy the industrys voracious appetite for talent. But London is a tech supertanker that other European cities are unlikely to be able to match any time soon, Brexit or no Brexit.
But in the era of COVID-19, will major hubs like London still be able to attract future tech unicorns, and will these be in the same sectors as before? Will geography be replaced by mere time zones?
We surveyed many of Londons top VCs to get their insights. Here’s who we heard from:

If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
Neither our investment thesis, nor our geographic focus has changed: we are a global investor, focused on the US, UK and Europe. We are filtering, even more, for the best founders, as geography feels less important in lockdown.
From that, what do you expect to happen to the startup climate in London longer term, with the shift to more remote work (post COVID-19), possibly from more remote areas. Will London stay a tech hub or will the ecosystem become more dispersed across the country?
As a global financial hub with substantial infrastructure (including capital) designed to support emerging technology, London will remain a critical node in the fintech ecosystem.
Long-term, do you expect to be more or less locally focused, especially in light of COVID-19 or in other ways?
We’re anticipating a pretty substantial change to working norms, at least over the near term (6-12 months). The long-term impact is likely to level the playing field for great founders operating outside of established tech hubs. Remote assessment of companies, while challenging, has the potential to create more equitable investment practices.

Will there be tech hubs post-COVID-19? What is a tech hub now, by your definition?
To the extent that culture, regulation and capital play a large role in favoring certain types of economic activity, I expect existing tech hubs to remain important bastions of innovation. That said, I think we will see the rise of complementary tech hubs, as well as teams “in the middle of nowhere” emboldened to start great companies.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
Given the proximity to the City and the heritage in financial technology innovation, the London tech ecosystem will continue to produce great fintech and insurtech companies."

America is now experiencing mass protests demanding an end to racism and police brutality, and watching as civil unrest unfolds in the midst of trying to quell the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Whether we are aware of or approve of it, in both contexts — and in every other facet of our lives — AI technologies are being deployed by government and private actors to make critical decisions about us. In many instances, AI is being utilized to assist society and to get us as quickly as practical to the next normal.
But so far, policymakers have largely overlooked a critical AI-driven public health and safety concern. When it comes to AI, most of the focus has been on the issues of fairness, bias and transparency in data sets used to train algorithms. There is no question that algorithms have yielded bias; one only need to look to employee recruiting and loan underwriting for examples of unfair exclusion of women and racial minorities.
Weve also seen AI generate unintended, and sometimes unexplainable, outcomes from the data. Consider the recent example of an algorithm that was supposed to assist judges with fair sentencing of nonviolent criminals. For reasons that have yet to be explained, the algorithm assigned higher risk scores to defendants younger than 23, resulting in 12% longer sentences than their older peers who had been incarcerated more frequently, while neither reducing incarceration nor recidivism.
But the current twin crises expose another more vexing problem that has been largely overlooked how should society address the scenario where the AI algorithm got it right but from an ethical standpoint, society is uncomfortable with the results? Since AIs essential purpose is to produce accurate predictive data from which humans can make decisions, the time has arrived for lawmakers to resolve not what is possible with respect to AI, but what should be prohibited.
Governments and private corporations have a never-ending appetite for our personal data. Right now, AI algorithms are being utilized around the world, including in the United States, to accurately collect and analyze all kinds of data about all of us. We have facial recognition to surveil protestors in a crowd or to determine whether the general public is observing proper social distancing. There is cell phone data for contact tracing, as well as public social media posts to model the spread of coronavirus to specific zip codes and to predict location, size and potential violence associated with demonstrations. And lets not forget drone data that is being used to analyze mask usage and fevers, or personal health data used to predict which patients hospitalized with COVID have the greatest chance of deteriorating.
Only through the use of AI can this quantity of personal data be compiled and analyzed on such a massive scale.
This access by algorithms to create an individualized profile of our cell phone data, social behavior, health records, travel patterns and social media content — and many other personal data sets — in the name of keeping the peace and curtailing a devastating pandemic can, and will, result in various governmental actors and corporations creating frighteningly accurate predictive profiles of our most private attributes, political leanings, social circles and behaviors.
Left unregulated, society risks these AI-generated analytics being used by law enforcement, employers, landlords, doctors, insurers — and every other private, commercial and governmental enterprise that can collect or purchase it — to make predictive decisions, be they accurate or not, that impact our lives and strike a blow to the most fundamental notions of a liberal democracy. AI continues to assume an ever-expanding role in the employment context to decide who should be interviewed, hired, promoted and fired. In the criminal justice context, it is used to determine who to incarcerate and what sentence to impose. In other scenarios, AI restrict people to their homes, limit certain treatment at the hospital, deny loans and penalize those who disobey social distancing regulations.
Too often, those who eschew any type of AI regulation seek to dismiss these concerns as hypothetical and alarmist. But just a few weeks ago, Robert Williams, a Black man and Michigan resident, was wrongfully arrested because of a false face recognition match. According to news reports and an ACLU press release, Detroit police handcuffed Mr. Williams on his front lawn in front of his wife and two terrified girls, ages two and five. The police took him to a detention center about 40 minutes away, where he was locked up overnight. After an officer acknowledged during an interrogation the next afternoon that the computer must have gotten it wrong, Mr. Williams was finally released nearly 30 hours after his arrest.
While widely believed to be the first confirmed case of AI’s incorrect facial recognition leading to the arrest of an innocent citizen, it seems clear this won’t be the last. Here, AI served as the primary basis for a critical decision that impacted the individual citizen being arrested by law enforcement. But we must not only focus on the fact that the AI failed by identifying the wrong person, denying him his freedom. We must identify and proscribe those instances where AI should not be used as the basis for specified critical decisions — even when it gets it “right.”
As a democratic society, we should be no more comfortable with being arrested for a crime we contemplated but did not commit, or being denied medical treatment for a disease that will undoubtedly end in death over time, as we are with Mr. Williams’ mistaken arrest. We must establish an AI no-fly zone to preserve our individual freedoms. We must not allow certain key decisions to be left solely to the predictive output of artificially intelligent algorithms.
To be clear, this means that even in situations where every expert agrees that the data in and out is completely unbiased, transparent and accurate, there must be a statutory prohibition on utilizing it for any type of predictive or substantive decision-making. This is admittedly counter-intuitive in a world where we crave mathematical certainty, but necessary.
Section 102(b) of the Artificial Intelligence Data Protection Act properly and rationally accomplishes this in the context of both scenarios — where AI generates correct and/or incorrect outcomes. It does this in two key ways.
First, Section 102(b) specifically identifies those decisions which can never be made in whole or in part by AI. For example, it enumerates specific misuses of AI that would prohibit covered entities’ sole reliance on artificial intelligence to make certain decisions. These include recruitment, hiring and discipline of individuals, the denial or limitation of medical treatment, or medical insurance issuers making decisions regarding coverage of a medical treatment. In light of what society has recently witnessed, the prohibited areas should likely be expanded to further minimize the risk that AI will be used as a tool for racial discrimination and harassment of protected minorities.
Second, for certain other specific decisions based on AI analytics that are not outright prohibited, Section 102(b) define those instances where a human must be involved in the decision-making process.
By enacting Section 102(b) without delay, legislators can maintain the dignity of the individual by not allowing the most critical decisions that impact the individual to be left solely to the predictive output of artificially intelligent algorithms.

The technology giant announced the takedown of the business email compromise operation in a Tuesday blog post.
Tom Burt, Microsoft’s consumer security chief, said the attackers tried to gain access to victims’ email inboxes, contacts and other sensitive files in order to send emails to businesses that look like they came from a trusted source. The end goal of the attack is to steal information or redirect wire transfers.
Last year, the FBI said businesses lost more than $1.7 billion as a result of business email compromise attacks.
Microsoft said it first detected and scuppered the operation in December, but that the attackers returned, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a fresh lure to open malicious emails. In one week alone, the attackers sent malicious emails to millions of users, Microsoft said.
Last month, the company secretly sought legal action by asking a federal court to allow it to take control and “sinkhole” the attacker’s domains, effectively shutting down the operation. The court granted Microsoft’s request shortly after but under seal, preventing the attackers from learning of the imminent shutdown of their operation.
Details of the case were unsealed Monday after Microsoft secured control of the domains.
It shows a growing trend of using the U.S. courts system to shut down cyberattacks when time is of the essence, without having to involve the federal authorities, a process that’s frequently cumbersome, bureaucratic, and seldom quick.
“This unique civil case against COVID-19-themed [business email compromise] attacks has allowed us to proactively disable key domains that are part of the criminals malicious infrastructure, which is a critical step in protecting our customers,” said Burt.
Microsoft declined to say who, or if it knew, who was behind the attack but a spokesperson confirmed it was not a nation state-backed operation.
The attack worked by tricking victims into turning over access to their email accounts. Court filings seen by TechCrunch describe how the attackers used “phishing emails are designed to look like they come from an employer or other trusted source,” while designed to look like they are legitimate emails from Microsoft.

Once clicked, the phishing email opens a legitimate Microsoft login page. But once the victim enters their username and password, the victim is redirected to a malicious web app that was built and controlled by the attackers. If the user is tricked into approving the web app access to their accounts, the web app siphons off and sends the victim’s account access tokens to the attackers. Account access tokens are designed to keep users logged in without having to re-enter their passwords, but if stolen and abused, can grant full access to a victim’s account.
Burt said the malicious operation allowed the attackers to trick victims into giving over access to their accounts “without explicitly” requiring the victim to turn over their username and password, “as they would in a more traditional phishing campaign.”
With access to those accounts, the attackers would have full control of the accounts to send spoofed messages designed to trick companies into turning over sensitive information or carry out fraud, a common tactic for financially-driven attackers.
By taking out the attackers’ domains used in the attack, Burt said the civil case against the attackers let the company “to proactively disable key domains that are part of the criminals malicious infrastructure.”
It’s not the first time Microsoft has asked a court to grant it ownership of malicious domains. In the past two years, Microsoft took control of domains belonging to hackers backed by both Russia and Iran."

Since the disease was first identified on U.S. shores, the Berkeley research institute led by the trailblazing CRISPR researcher Jennifer Doudna has worked tirelessly to bring innovative methods to diagnose and process viral samples and develop potential treatments for the disease to production.
The new saliva-based samples that the university is trialing would obviate the need for trained medical staff wearing personal protective equipment to conduct tests to determine whether an individual is infected.
If the study proves that the new testing method can work as well as nasal swabs, then the Berkeley campus will be able to increase testing of students, faculty and staff ahead of the beginning of the school’s fall semester in late August, according to a statement from the University.

At Berkeley, we hope to bring at least some of our undergraduate students back to campus safely in the fall, and one way to do that is to provide them with asymptomatic regular testing, so that we can be monitoring their health and insuring that they are not transmitting the virus, said Jennifer Doudna, who spearheaded the pop-up diagnostics lab and the saliva testing, in a statement.
Doudna thinks the tests could be conducted in as little as five or six minutes. The study is already open to faculty, staff and students who can sign up to participate in the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing study on the institute’s website.
As opposed to swab testing, saliva testing is a lot simpler and allows people to literally spit into a tube, Doudna said. We think it will take about five or six minutes as they pass through our testing center here, so we hope to make this very painless, easy and simple for people to come by and get tested.
Graduate students, faculty and staff who are authorized to work on campus can sign up to participate in the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (FAST) study on the IGI website.
The tests rely on polymerase chain reactions which have already received Emergency Use Authorization for at-home testing from the Food and Drug Administration.
Using the CRISPR-Cas proteins, whose application for genetic engineering was pioneered by Doudna and her fellow researchers, the IGI is working on a less expensive, point-of-care home test that could give people results in minutes without the need for a laboratory analysis.
The Innovative Genomics Institute was founded by Doudna in 2014 and by Berkeley and the University of California San Francisco to advance CRISPR-based genome editing.
Earlier in June, the institute brought a new robotic handling system to accelerate testing capacity for the disease to 1,000 tests per day, according to a statement from the University. 
When the pandemic hit, we asked ourselves, What do we as scientists do to address the COVID-19 health emergency? Doudna said, in a statement. That effort has focused on testing. We set up a clinical laboratory, we are now getting asymptomatic saliva testing going for the UC Berkeley campus. We hope that if it works well here, we can help disseminate this strategy elsewhere."

But its founder says its technology can do just that, even if it wasn’t the company’s original plan.
Butlr, a spin-out of the MIT Media Lab, uses a mix of wireless, battery-powered hardware and artificial intelligence to track people’s movements indoors without violating their privacy. The startup uses ceiling-mounted sensors to detect individuals’ body heat to track where a person walks and where they might go next. The use-cases are near-endless. The sensors can turn on mood-lighting or air conditioning when it detects movement, help businesses understand how shoppers navigate their stores, determine the wait-time in the queues at the checkout, and even sound the alarm if it detects a person after-hours.
By using passive infrared sensors to detect only body heat, the sensors don’t know who you are only where you are and where you’re heading. The tracking stops as soon as you leave the sensor’s range, like when you leave a store.
The technology is in high demand. Butlr says some 200,000 retail stores use its technology, not least because it’s far cheaper than the more privacy-invading and expensive alternatives, like surveillance cameras and facial recognition.
But when the pandemic hit, most of those stores closed as effectively did entire cities and nations to counter the ongoing threat from of COVID-19. But those stores would have to open again, and so Butlr got back to work.
Butlr’s privacy-friendly body heat sensors don’t know who you are only where you are. Now the company is retooling its technology to help combat coronavirus. (Image: Butlr)
Butlr’s co-founder Honghao Deng told TechCrunch that it began retooling its technology to help support stores opening again.
The company quickly rolled out new software features like maximum occupancy and queue management to help stores with sensors already installed cope with the new but ever-changing laws and guidance that businesses had to comply with.
Deng said that the sensors can make sure no more than the allowed number of people can be in a store at once, and make sure that staff are protected from customers by helping to enforce social distancing rules. Customers can also see live queue data to help them pick a less-crowded time to shop, said Deng.
All these things before a pandemic might have sounded, frankly, a little dull. Fast forward to the middle of a pandemic and you’re probably thankful for all the help and the technology you can get.
Butlr tested its new features in China at the height of the pandemic’s rise in February, and later rolled out to its global customers, including in the United States. Deng said Butlr’s technology is already helping customers at furniture store Steelcase, supermarket chain 99 Ranch Market, and the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi to help them reopen while minimizing the risk to others.
It’s a pivot that’s paid off. Last month Butlr raised $1.2 million in seed funding, just as the pandemic was reaching its peak in the United States.
Nobody knew a pandemic was coming, not least Deng. And as the pandemic spread, businesses have suffered. If it wasn’t for quick thinking, Butlr might’ve been another startup that succumbed to the pandemic.
Instead, the startup is probably going to help save lives and without compromising anyone’s privacy."

Research showed that 6.5% of COVID-19 patients can suddenly progress to serious illness, and among them the mortality rate can be as high as 49%. Therefore one of the key tasks for health authorities is to identify and treat patients who may develop severe or fatal syndromes early on.
That’s what has been underway at a research team jointly established by Tencent AI Lab and a group of Chinese public health scientists headed by Zhong Nanshan, the country’s senior medical advisor on COVID-19, since its inception in February.
This week, the team unveiled a deep learning-based model that can predict the risk of coronavirus patients developing critical illness. The details were published in Nature Communications, recounting how the the lab devised the model based on a cohort of 1590 patients from 575 medical centers in China, with further validation from 1393 patients.
The joint lab made the predictor available online, allowing clinical staff around the world to calculate patients’ probability of developing critical illness within 5, 10, and 30 days using ten clinical variables. While its immediate focus is on COVID-19, the lab’s long-term mission, in its own words, is to “utilize big data and AI for the screening, prevention and control, and warning of outbreaks, respiratory diseases and thoracic diseases.”
Other Chinese tech giants have been taking up similar projects to contain the deadly virus. Using machine and deep learning, Alibaba built a tool for institutions to forecast the spread of COVID-19 with an alleged 90% accuracy rate. Baidu open-sourced an algorithm for viral structural analysis, claiming the process is 120 times faster than the traditional method.
Tencent AI Lab is the tech behemoth’s effort to stay afloat in a race to develop cutting-edge technology alongside money-making businesses such as video games and social networks. Launched in 2016, the research arm works on computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning through a team of 70 research scientists and 300 engineers.
The lab competes with its local counterparts like Alibaba’s Damo Academy and Baidu Research to hunt down the world’s best AI minds. Often that means hiring a well-established scientist to attract young talents. In recent years, Baidu suffered from the departure of Andrew Ng and Lu Qi, and Tencent AI Lab, too, lost its leading figure Zhang Tong last year."

In the filing, reported by Reuters, a San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman writes that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health and San Francisco’s Department of Public Health have all opened investigations into the online retail giant’s workplace practices in light of the pandemic. The Attorney General’s office declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch.
While Amazon faced frequent criticism for worker well being before the pandemic, the ongoing crisis has made those concerns even more stark. With white-collar workers sent home, the virus has spread quickly through clusters of employees at factory floors and warehouses nationwide where social distancing isn’t enforced. Amazon’s own shipping centers have reported outbreaks, including one in the Pocono Mountains and another in Oregon and by May eight Amazon warehouse workers had died from the virus.
The disclosure of the three California state investigations came out of court case accusing Amazon of failing to adequately protect workers in a San Francisco Amazon Fresh Fulfillment Center. In the lawsuit, filed in March, Amazon Fresh worker Chiyomi Brent accuses the company of taking risks, including sharing the suits they wear into freezers without cleaning them after each use. Brent also filed a complaint with California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, which is now looking into Amazon’s distribution center practices."

This column collects the most interesting of those papers and advances, along with notes on why they may prove important in the world of tech and startups. This week: supercomputers take on COVID-19, beetle backpacks, artificial spiderwebs, the “overwhelming whiteness” of AI and more.
First off, if (like me) you missed this amazing experiment where scientists attached tiny cameras to the backs of beetles, I don’t think I have to explain how cool it is. But you may wonder… why do it? Prolific UW researcher Shyam Gollakota and several graduate students were interested in replicating some aspects of insect vision, specifically how efficient the processing and direction of attention is.
The camera backpack has a narrow field of view and uses a simple mechanism to direct its focus rather than processing a wide-field image at all times, saving energy and better imitating how real animals see. “Vision is so important for communication and for navigation, but its extremely challenging to do it at such a small scale. As a result, prior to our work, wireless vision has not been possible for small robots or insects,” said Gollakota. You can watch the critters in action below — and don’t worry, the beetles lived long, happy lives after their backpack-wearing days.
The health and medical community is always making interesting strides in technology, but it’s often pretty niche stuff. These two items from recent weeks are a bit more high-profile.
One is a new study being conducted by UCLA in concert with Apple, which especially with its smartwatch has provided lots of excellent data to, for example, studies of arrhythmia. In this case, doctors are looking at depression and anxiety, which are considerably more difficult to quantify and detect. But by using Apple Watch, iPhone and sleep monitor measurements of activity levels, sleep patterns and so on, a large body of standardized data can be amassed."

The video in question was a clip from a Fox News segment from Wednesday morning in which the president makes the unsubstantiated claim that children are “almost immune” to COVID-19. While much remains unknown about the novel coronavirus, children can contract COVID-19 and are believed to be able to spread it to others, even without symptoms.

But the COVID-19 pandemic is not what anyone had in mind when the Bluetooth standard was created, so the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is working to create a new specification that would allow wearable devices to work in tandem with smartphones to expand the reach of ENS tech.
That would mean that devices like wristworn smartwatches and activity/health trackers could also participate in systems that track potential exposure and provide notifications about potential COVID-19 contact events. It may seem like a small tweak if you assume that most smartphone users are seldom without those devices, but Bluetooth SIG points out that expanding to wearables could help include groups of people who aren’t typically smartphone users including young, school-aged children, and older adults in care facilities in ENS efforts.
You could easily see how that would be useful, once this new spec is completed and incorporated into deployed Bluetooth standards. Schools could potential mandate use of simple, cheap Bluetooth-enabled wearables to track potential exposure as they return to physical classroom education, for instance.
It’s too early to say exactly how and when this will be deployed the Bluetooth SIG says that it plans to have an initial draft of the new spec available “in the next few months” for its members to review. But the group has powerful members including Apple, Microsoft, Intel and others, and the technology proposed would allow Apple and Google to incorporate wearables into their existing exposure notification platform, while preserving the privacy-protecting aspects of the tech, as illustrated in the infographic below."

One startup in the space has been acquired in the wake of that.
IfOnly — an “experiences” marketplace based around access to exclusive, and often expensive, events and people, with a portion of the proceeds that a guest pays for the experience going towards good causes — was quietly acquired and shut down by credit giant Mastercard for an undisclosed sum. Mastercard told TechCrunch that it has folded the tech and team into Priceless — its own experiences marketplace — after initially leading a strategic investment in the company in 2018.
“At the end of last year, IfOnly, whose technology helps to power Priceless.com, became part of the Mastercard family, bringing their expertise and know-how in-house,” a spokesperson said. “The IfOnly platform will continue to help advance our Priceless strategy and our combined team will be even better positioned and equipped to deliver exclusive experiences for cardholders globally.”
IfOnly had been founded and previously led by Trevor Traina, a businessman, member of one of the wealthiest families in the US, and a well-connected Trump supporter. Traina eventually left the role of CEO when Trump appointed him ambassador to Austria in 2018. He was replaced by John Boris, who had been the CMO of Shutterfly. He still lists the CEO role of IfOnly as his current gig.
Mastercard had been just one of IfOnly’s big strategic investors; others were Hyatt Hotels, Sotheby’s and American Express, while financial backers investors included the likes of Founders Fund, NEA and Khosla. Together, investors had collectively put nearly $50 million into the startup. IfOnly was last valued at about $105 million, according to PitchBook data.
While Mastercard said that it had acquired the company at the beginning of the year, it turned out to be a soft landing for the startup, given the global turn of events and how it has impacted the travel industry.
It was only in July of this year that IfOnly had posted a notice on its site announcing the closure and acquisition. (A reader tipped us on the development last week.)
But before that, IfOnly’s business had ground to a halt in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. In the archived pages of the site (via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine) the company announced months ago that it would be pausing the availability of its experiences “due to the COVID-19 situation”, saying it would update as it learned more.
The sale (and closure) puts an end to a startup that began life with exclusive experiences that appeared to be aimed squarely at the one percent. One offer (on an archived page) for example offered “a family weekend feasting in Florence, Italy” starting at 62,851 (about $74,000) for four people, and tours of the Champagne region in France.
But the startup appeared to want to widen that out. Another offer included a session with the founders of “Goat Yoga” in Las Vegas for a private feeding and yoga session with baby goats (yes, this is a thing), starting at about $33 per person, depending on group numbers and presumably the number of goats and other parameters. Each experience was tied to a particular charity that would benefit from the purchase.
It also looks like IfOnly had also expanded into single, virtual experiences and those that could be bid on, both directly on its site and in partnership with auctioneers Sotheby’s. These included having customised voicemails created by Susan Sarandon, or bidding on a lunch with Mary Kay Place.
But the writing may have been on the wall, with the startup not formulating any kind of “plan B” on its site in the wake of the global health pandemic. Others that have built businesses around experiences — visiting places, going on tours, meeting famous people and doing other things to engage people in something new either close to home or further afield — have had to completely rethink their approach.
Airbnb — which had moved aggressively into experiences some years ago to complement and expand its accommodation booking platform — in April launched Airbnb Online Experiences, offering virtual tours and other video-based engagements to users.
GetYourGuide, the very well-capitalised Berlin-based startup offering unique tours and other travel-based experiences, has brought in pay cuts and reassessed its business model essentially around the idea of writing off 2020 (that is, assuming no one books for this year), in hopes of a turnaround in the longer term.
Meanwhile, Klook resorted to cutting staff. And yet others like Omaze — which like IfOnly also ties in its experiences with raising money for charity — are still raising money and operating, albeit currently needing to delay some of the experiences they’re selling.
For Mastercard, the Priceless platform is part of the company’s wider efforts to expand its business beyond basic card services. (That’s something that has seen companies like Mastercard, Visa and Amex expand into services for businesses, too, such as Mastercard’s purchase of B2B payments company Nets, and Amex’s purchase of SMB loans platform Kabbage.) Services like Priceless also help Mastercard create more brand loyalty with its customers, and to potentially make better revenues per user through more direct retailing.
As with other experience purveyors like Airbnb, it seems like the Priceless offerings have moved into the completely virtual sphere, selling people a chance to meet sports celebrities online, go backstage at famous theatres, and learn how to mix drinks with well-known mixologists. These may now be powered by IfOnly, but only in part: the option to give to charities doesn’t appear to have carried over with the deal."

According to new data from IBM’s U.S. Retail Index, the pandemic has accelerated the shift away from physical stores to digital shopping by roughly 5 years. Department stores, as a result, are seeing significant declines. In the first quarter of 2020, department store sales and those from other “non-essential” retailers declined by 25%. This grew to a 75% decline in the second quarter.
The report indicates that department stores are expected to decline by over 60% for the full year. Meanwhile, e-commerce is projected to grow by nearly 20% in 2020.
The pandemic has also helped refine which categories of goods consumers feel are essential, the study found. Clothing, for example, declined in importance as more consumers began working and schooling from home, as well as social distancing under government lockdowns. However, other categories including groceries, alcohol, and home improvement materials accelerated, by 12%, 16% and 14%, respectively.

The report suggests that department store retailers will need to more quickly pivot to omnichannel fulfillment capabilities in order to remain competitive in the new environment. Specifically, they will need to drive traffic to their stores through services like buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS) and will need to offer an expanded set of ship-from-store services.
Large retailers like Walmart and Target have embraced omnichannel fulfillment to their advantage. Both reported stellar earnings this month thanks to their earlier investments in e-commerce. In Walmart’s case, the pandemic helped drive e-commerce sales up 97% in its last quarter. Target set a sales record as its same-day fulfillment services grew 273% in the quarter. Both retailers have also invested in online grocery, with Walmart today offering grocery pickup and delivery services, the latter through partners. Target has also just now rolled out grocery pickup and runs delivery through Shipt.
Amazon, naturally, has also benefited from the shift to digital with its recent record quarterly profit and 40% sales growth.
The growth in e-commerce due to the pandemic has set a high bar for what’s now considered baseline growth. According to the Q2 2020 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. retail e-commerce reached $211.5 billion, up 31.8% year-over-year, in the quarter. E-commerce also accounted for 16.1% of total retail sales in Q2, up from 11.8% in the first quarter of 2020.
The questions that IBM’s report aims to answer is how much of this pandemic-fueled online spending is a temporary shift and to what extent is it impacting longer-term forecasts? The answer, at least in this estimate, is that this pandemic pushed the industry ahead by around five years. The shift away from physical stores was already underway, that is — but we’ve now jumped ahead in time as to where we would be if a health crisis had not occurred.
This is a similar trend to what other industries have seen as well, including things like streaming/cord cutting, gaming, and social video apps, and more."

Their challenge: Keep the polling places safe and efficient while providing more effective and trustworthy options for citizens.
Efforts to expand mail-in voting options because of COVID-19 were criticized for overwhelming election clerks and disenfranchising voters, whose ballots were either lost or not counted during the primaries.
Recently, government and media criticism of allowing more mail-in voting beyond traditional absentee ballots has cast a harsh light on flaws in the system.
I believe we can implement a better technology choice that guarantees a voters identity, keeps the vote anonymous and keeps voters safe from COVID-19. A mobile voting system that provides a supplemental option to in-person voting makes the most sense in this highly charged political atmosphere.
We have an archaic voting system
Efforts to provide voting options beyond in-person balloting have increased over the years to encourage greater turnout, which is still abysmally low. Ideas such as mail-in balloting, extended hours, weekend voting and other options have found mixed success, but still rely on old, outdated processes. The decentralized nature of the U.S. election process, in which individual towns choose their preferred voting method, has resulted in voting devices that range from paper ballots to mechanical voting machines to electronic voting via a touch-screen tablet.
One only needs to look at the 2000 presidential election recount to see this archaic process in action, as the term hanging chad entered the lexicon. Many efforts around improving the election process began as a result of the 2000 election, but now, two decades later, we still see the same process, and the same mistakes, in many locations.
Efforts aimed at expanding mail-in voting earlier this year during the primaries were troubling. In one Pennsylvania county, 6,000 voters were not mailed their ballots until the day before the election, preventing them from getting ballots postmarked before the deadline.
Across the nation, voters requested ballots but did not receive them in time to vote. Even when ballots were mailed in on time, election officials were overwhelmed with the spike in volume.
In-person voting: Long lines, masks, dangerous for at-risk populations
With the COVID-19 virus maintaining its hold on a large part of the country, election officials need to develop in-person voting plans that keep residents safe, but the potential for disaster looms. In many locales, a presidential election often results in long lines and wait times at polling centers, often with understaffed officials or volunteers working tables to verify voter registration.
Many of these volunteers are older Americans, members of the highest-risk population for developing serious complications from the virus. Not only will election officials need to ensure the safety of voters, but they will also need to make sure their own workers and volunteers are protected. This means developing more protocols, testing and potential disinfection procedures, which could extend the time it takes for people to vote.
Given the potential of a multihour wait with hundreds or more people in line, many citizens would likely simply choose to not vote, which would be a greater disaster to American democracy.
Mobile voting is secure
A mobile voting system allows registered voters to use their mobile phones and a verified app to record their vote. Using blockchain technology, an app can provide an audit trail that verifies the identity of the voter, and keeps their vote anonymous. Mobile voting systems can also include a paper record for additional security.
Early mobile voting programs have allowed an easier way for citizens and military personnel overseas to cast their ballots. The same is true for individuals with physical disabilities that could also be vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.
A 2018 mobile voting pilot program for citizens and military personnel overseas held in West Virginia provided a high rate of engagement.
Mobile voting has also proved more secure than other electronic voting methods, including web-based voting systems. Critics of electronic voting have lobbed accusations of potential hacking, but the facts tell a different story.
As of May 2020, Tusk Philanthropies has successfully completed 14 mobile voting pilots in five states with several mobile voting technology platforms and a mix of overseas voters and those with disabilities. Its good to be concerned about election security, but mobile voting offers more security than existing electoral systems, which can include late or lost ballots, incorrect markings, machine breakdowns and other errors.
Democracy is strengthened when everyone participates
In these challenging and worrisome times, trust and faith in our government leaders is of utmost importance. The right for Americans to vote in a safe, secure and trustworthy environment is fundamental to continue the ideals that so many of our predecessors fought and died to protect.
When more citizens participate in the process, democracy is strengthened. Failing to explore new options to prevent a voting disaster this fall amidst a global pandemic could have grave repercussions on the future of this nation."

General Motors is partnering with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of ventilators that are needed in hospitals dealing with patients who have the novel coronavirus, the companies announced Friday. In the most severe cases of COVID-19 infection, patients need the assistance of ventilators to breathe, and there are widespread concerns that the US does not have enough ventilators to meet the coming demand.
Seattle-based Ventec is one of a handful of ventilator manufacturers in the US, according to NBC News, and already has ramped up its production. Ventec CEO Chris Kiple says the company is aiming to produce 1,000 machines per month (up from its usual 150 per month), in the next 90 days, and eventually, to produce 2,000 ventilators per month. 
Ventec will rely on GMs manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing to help build more ventilators more quickly. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that GM would continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis. 
Other automakers including Ford and Volkswagen also reportedly have contacted the White House to see how they could help with ventilator production. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla and SpaceX employees were working on ventilators and despite a tweet from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that the machines were definitely needed, Musk didnt provide further details about when or where his companies would produce the machines.

People in the US are worried about the new coronavirus outbreak. That concern is warranted: the virus is a scary new threat, it can cause serious harm, and there arent any medications that can stop it. Thats not to mention the cancellations of schools, popular events, and the general disruption to peoples lives its causing.
But fear, and the things people do when theyre afraid, changes and drives the societal impact of the virus. Viruses cant function on their own: they require a host, a person, in order to survive and reproduce. That person makes choices and behaves in certain ways. When that persons behaviors are driven by fear, it can lead to discrimination and decision-making out of line with public health recommendations which can make the outbreak even worse.
Thats the major common thread connecting outbreaks from the Black Death to the current novel coronavirus outbreak: fear and panic can magnify the harm done by a virus. People can get worked up and do bad things in response, says Philip Alcabes, professor of public health at Hunter College and author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to Avian Flu. 
In the US, panic over rising case counts has triggered a rush on grocery stores and pharmacies. In New York City, for example, theres hardly a bottle of hand sanitizer to be found, and pasta and beans are in short supply. Its good to prepare for disruption to everyday life, but theres a difference between preparedness and panic buying and the later can cause shortages. 
More troublingly, people in the US and around the world have also been buying up supplies of surgical masks and respirators, despite pleas from experts not to. Masks may offer some people comfort, but they dont provide much protection against illness if theyre not used properly (and laypeople usually dont use them properly). When theyre squirreled away in peoples homes, theyre not available for health care workers who actually need them and know how to use them. 
The World Health Organization says that there are worldwide shortages of masks and other protective equipment, and that puts health care workers at risk. Thats a problem for everyone, and it can exacerbate outbreaks. If health care workers, who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients, get sick in high numbers because they dont have proper protection, it adds to the caseload for hospitals. It also leaves fewer nurses and doctors to treat patients. 
Panic also unearths racism and discrimination. The novel coronavirus originated in China, and when it started to spread, anti-Asian racism took off around the world. The same thing happened during the SARS outbreak in 2002. Its an old story, Alcabes says. When the Black Death first came to Europe, there were rumors in Switzerland that a Jewish guy had a secret recipe for poison and was putting it in drinking wells, he says. It caused a series of really dreadful attacks on Jewish communities. The fear doesnt create prejudice; it just reveals it. It allows it to manifest. And it can do so in ways that can be really harmful to people, he says.
Also harmful are rumors and misinformation, which can spread quickly during epidemic outbreaks. They had devastating effects during the 20142015 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa: people kept sick relatives home because they were afraid of treatment centers. When they tried to care for them without proper equipment, they quickly became ill themselves. That let the disease spread among families, which made the outbreak harder to contain.
At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, false theories that the virus was a bioweapon developed by the Chinese government or by Bill Gates spread online and were repeated by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). A right-wing blog doxxed the Chinese scientist it accused of creating the weapon. In Iran, fake letters from health officials spread on social media, and bad information on the best ways to prevent infection from the virus circulated online. An email hoax led to protests in Ukraine that turned violent.
People often turn to misinformation out of fear and when they cant access or dont trust information from experts or public health officials, Rob Blair, assistant professor of political science and international and public affairs at Brown University, told The Verge. Believing misinformation can then create distrust in experts. That cycle may lead people to disregard public health advice and continue to, for example, buy and hoard masks or to ignore recommendations around isolation and quarantine. 
In the US, the spread of misinformation around the novel coronavirus has been facilitated by President Trump who has contradicted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by claiming, incorrectly, that vaccines would be available soon, that testing was widely available, and that people with symptoms of COVID-19 can go to work. The mismatch in messaging between the CDC and the president can make it hard for people to know what to trust and believe. That confusion can create and exacerbate panic.
After the Ebola outbreaks, experts wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that public health officials and authorities need to grapple with fear in their response to future outbreaks. Fear-related behaviors have the potential to accelerate the spread of a disease, they wrote.
During a disease outbreak, anxiety and worry are reasonable reactions, and its important to take precautions to reduce the spread of disease. People should wash their hands, stay home if theyre sick, and keep away from crowds; officials should consider rescheduling or canceling mass gatherings all expert-recommended and evidence-based strategies that can blunt the worst societal side effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. But striving to avoid acting out of fear and pushing public officials to communicate in ways that help limit it can help make sure those strategies have the greatest possible effect.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted the news as part of an update on Facebook’s COVID-19 pandemic response, where he also said the “vast majority” of Facebook employees would work from home until at least the end of next month. The cancellations include the Oculus Connect 7 virtual reality conference in San Jose, which is being replaced by an online-only event. “We will require the vast majority of our employees to work from home through at least the end of May in order to create a safer environment both for our employees doing critical jobs who must be in the office and for everyone else in our local communities,” writes Zuckerberg. Some employees, including moderators who cover terrorism and self-harm-related content, can’t work remotely. But “overall, we don’t expect to have everyone back in our offices for some time.” As we start to think about what it will look like to re-open society, I wanted to provide an update on how we're... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, April 16, 2020 Zuckerberg notes that health experts don’t know when large gatherings will be advisable again, so Facebook is preemptively canceling physical events for the next year. That covers not only Oculus Connect but probably also the company’s main F8 conference, which is typically held in the spring. To make up for the loss in revenue from Oculus Connect 7, Facebook will donate $500,000 to the city of San Jose. Much of Oculus Connect is already streamed online, but the show is also a chance for press and developers to check out prototype hardware and new games and apps. Facebook is extending its “no business travel” policy through June 2021 as well, so it’s doubtful it would even ask smaller groups to come see hardware. As for the rest, “we look forward to sharing more details about the digital event in the coming months.” One leak suggests Oculus is working on a new headset codenamed “Del Mar,” and the company could still announce news about it at the show — but with manufacturing supply chains currently in flux, it could be hitting pause on that project, too."

Verizon is canceling scheduled appointments for internet installation and repairs, according to some customers and two Verge reporters with persistent internet issues. The decision potentially leaves Fios subscribers without wired internet at a time when theyre likely relying on it for work and to see friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are minimizing our in-home installation work to critical needs to keep our employees and customers safe and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, Verizon says in a support document. 
We are minimizing our in-home installation work to critical needs.
To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our employees and customers safe, we are making every attempt to perform work without going into homes or small businesses and are limiting in-home installs to medical emergencies and critical installations, Verizon tells The Verge in a statement. Self-install options are also available for qualified service orders, the company added.
However, Verizon actually changed the language in the support document sometime on Tuesday morning, according to Business Insider. Previously, the site said that our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services or to do repair work.
Here is the previous language, from a version of the page archived on Monday:
As a result of COVID-19, we are taking precautions to keep our employees and customers safe. At this time, our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services or to do repair work. Qualified orders will be provided self-install options, or you may proceed with placing an order for a technician-required installation and it will be held for future appointment priority. You will receive notification to select an installation date when we resume operations.
Users on Twitter have reported that their installation appointments have been canceled. One said yesterday that his installation appointment was canceled for internet that he needed for school. In a reply, Verizon said its technicians will not be able to enter your home to install new services or do repair work.

Earlier today, Verizon told a customer who said their installation appointment was canceled that qualified orders will be provided self-install options and that he would get future appointment priority if he opted for installation by a technician.

SomeTwitterusers have reported that Verizon is telling them that a technician might fix their internet in November, but Verizon said in reply to one of those users that the November date is incorrect and is simply a placeholder for customers in your area.

Verizons new policies have also affected reporters here at The Verge. Science reporter Loren Grush hasnt had internet from Verizon since April 1st. A technician came to her apartment that day to investigate, but they said an engineering technician needed to look at the problem and potentially do a repair. The engineering technicians appointment was scheduled for yesterday, but they never showed up. Verizon told Grush there was a new protocol implemented on April 6th that meant technicians could no longer come into her home. 
I tried calling today but essentially was told engineering will call you, Grush said in a Slack message. We have to wait for them to call us, and since this new rule is in place, Im not entirely hopeful.
Im worried once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable.
In the meantime, Grush and her husband have been forced to rely on their mobile hotspots for internet, which they need for their work right now. She says she almost hit her mobile data cap, while her husband had to pay to add a higher data cap. Im worried [that] once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable, said Grush. 
Makena Kelly, a policy reporter at The Verge, has also been experiencing problems with her Fios internet since April 1st. A technician was scheduled to check on the problem on April 4th, but the internet returned, so Verizon canceled the appointment, she said in a Slack message. The internet went out again later that day, and Kelly hasnt been able to reschedule an appointment.
To help customers fix issues that dont need a technician to visit in person, Verizon tells The Verge that its piloting a virtual assistant tech tool that allows our field technicians to interact with customers via real time, interactive video chat. The company has not responded to questions from The Verge about how big that pilot is or when it might roll out more broadly."

Photo by Avijit Ghosh/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
The COVID-19 pandemic is on the verge of colliding with another public health threat: extreme heat, which kills more people in the US each year than any other weather-related event. Public health officials usually recommend that people without air conditioning head to places like malls and libraries where they can cool off, but thats not an option for a lot of people sheltering at home. 
The problem could soon begin to affect India
The problem could soon begin to affect India, where temperatures begin to climb in April and have reached as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Indias 1.3 billion residents have been ordered to stay indoors until April 14th to stop the spread of disease, and only about 5 percent of the population has air conditioning. 
Heat-related illness can begin with mild symptoms like a headache and muscle cramps, and they can progress to confusion, dizziness, vomiting, and losing consciousness. Once the body reaches a point where it can no longer cool itself down by sweating, heat stroke can lead to organ failure and eventually death. Those most at risk are often the poor and elderly, groups that are similarly hard-hit by the novel coronavirus. Heat-related deaths can be prevented by checking in on people who might be isolated indoors and providing public places for them to get out and cool down. But those strategies contradict efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, which mostly focus on keeping people apart.
Were in between a rock and a hard place if it were to become a heatwave during the time when were enacting physical distancing measures, says David Eisenman, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles department of community health sciences. 
Were in between a rock and a hard place
In developing countries, the migration to cities from rural areas has posed new problems when it comes to preventing deaths from heat. Traditionally built homes in less densely packed areas often included designs that naturally kept the structure cool, like inner courtyards and windows aligned to allow prevailing winds to pass through. But poorer newcomers to cities have packed into informal settlements where homes may be little more than brick or metal walls with a corrugated metal roof. Thats literally an oven, says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance, which partners with governments to plan more heat-resilient cities. Its estimated that 40 percent of the worlds urban expansion takes place in slums, and more than two-thirds of the worlds population is expected to live in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme. 
The problem is way worse in the developing world, but we shouldnt take that and say that were out of the woods here [in the US], Shickman says. The US sees upward of 600 heat-related deaths each year. Heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and more intense because of climate change, took a heavy toll in Europe last year, too, killing almost 1,500 in France last June and July. 
[Extreme heat] is even more of a pressing issue with the pandemic than it was beforehand, and this need for staying at home is only bringing out issues that already existed, says Sonal Jessel, a policy and advocacy coordinator for the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental Justice. Even though New York City has just stepped into spring, Jessel is already scrambling to figure out strategies to keep people safe in case hotter temperatures arrive earlier this year. 
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities like New York compared to surrounding areas, because all the asphalt and concrete absorb and trap heat. It can be even hotter in industrial neighborhoods with fewer trees and parks, which means some communities are more vulnerable than others. Almost half of all people who lost their lives to heat in New York City between 2000 and 2012 were African American, although theyre just under 25 percent of the citys population.
Now that were all instructed globally not to gather in close proximity, its going to really call for creativity and quick pivoting among public health systems around the world, says Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist at the National Resources Defense Council, who has worked with Jessels organization in New York and other groups in India to prevent heat-related illness and death. She and other public health experts are beginning to put their heads together to figure out how they may need to tackle two crises coming heat waves and the ongoing pandemic in tandem. But they dont have answers just yet.
Cities might have to figure out how to create publicly accessible places where people can cool down while also maintaining enough physical space between each other to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Eisenman at UCLA says. It just seems like a really hard thing to pull off, he says. 
More needs to be done to help people cool down at home
If beating the heat by going to a public place is out of the question, then more needs to be done to help people cool down at home, says Jessel. That means getting air conditioners into more homes, and helping people pay their utility bills so that they dont need to choose between running their air conditioning and paying for other necessities. With lots of people losing their jobs during the pandemic, making air conditioning affordable is even more pressing. Jessels organization is advocating for more funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that provides assistance with home energy bills. Beyond that, Jessel and other advocates are pushing for ways to retrofit homes to keep them cooler. Installing better insulation, painting roofs white to reflect the sun, and planting rooftop gardens can keep homes and buildings cool. 
Temperatures in parts of California, where theres a state-wide shelter-in-place order, are going to rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) next week. While Eisenman doesnt think those numbers will begin to pose a threat just yet, he warns that the first really hot days of the season can be particularly dangerous because people are still adjusting to the change in temperatures. And while California and New York are current hotspots for COVID-19 in the US, he worries that other states with fewer coronavirus cases now but hotter climates, like Arizona, might see their number of cases peak closer to the start of summer. That potential scenario could be deadly, which is why Eisenman and others are encouraging groups to take early measures to address the combination of threats before the case counts and temperatures start to rise.

Image: iFixit
Repair specialist iFixit is building a database filled with repair information for the worlds hospital equipment in anticipation of the increased demand caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In particular, its calling for repair manuals for ventilators and BiPAP machines that can be used as ventilators. iFixits database can be found here, and the company is calling for people to create new device pages and upload photographs and manuals.
The reasoning behind creating the database is simple: as the novel coronavirus spreads, the experience of Italian and Chinese hospitals suggests that the worlds supply of ventilators is going to be placed under huge stress, making it essential that these can be repaired quickly if and when they break down. This equipment will be an essential part of treating anyone who develops respiratory problems as a result of COVID-19.
Once its got the manuals, iFixit wants to make repair guides
There are currently few sources for repair manuals online. iFixit notes that resources like Franks Hospital Workshop exist, but these are relatively small operations. Some manufacturers provide easy access to repair manuals on their websites, but others make them harder to find.
There are a few different parts to iFixits campaign beyond assembling a collection of manuals. Once its got a manual, the company wants to format its information to make it as easy to understand as possible. It plans to break the manuals down into guides for individual repairs, to reformat them to make them more SEO-friendly, and to translate them into other languages.
iFixit also wants to put together preventive maintenance guides so technicians can work to keep their equipment in good working order before it reaches the point of breaking down.
As well as looking for people with access to repair information, iFixit is also asking for the medical community to provide information about which ventilators are currently in use as well as which parts are most likely to break. 
Its an important and timely initiative from a company thats usually associated with helping people fix their personal consumer electronics. If youve got access to any manuals that you think might be helpful for the initiative, you can upload them to iFixit directly or email the company if youve got a batch of manuals that would be too time-consuming to upload manually."

The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted departures from New York and Philadelphia airports after a trainee at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Long Island tested positive for COVID-19 today. The person had not been at the facility since March 17th, and the FAA is sanitizing affected areas. 
As of 2:45 PM ET, the agency had lifted the ground stop order, according to the Associated Press.
That center, which primarily handles high-altitude, cross-country flights, remained open. But the FAA rerouted flights as part of a longstanding contingency plan to ensure continued operations. 
The FAA said in a statement that it is working with local health officials and employee representatives to determine how many personnel might have interacted with the trainee in recent days.
CNBC reported that there have been staffing issues because of coronavirus at FAA facilities around the country; on Wednesday, flights from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas were diverted because an air traffic controller there potentially tested positive for COVID-19.

 (CNN)Covid-19 numbers are bad and getting worse. At the time of writing, there have been over 20.5 million cases and nearly 750,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States alone there are over 5 million cases, and the pandemic has now claimed more lives than those lost in the nearly two decades of the Vietnam War. 
As I am writing this, there are throngs of people at my apartment building's pool -- no masks and no physical distancing.
This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm a 20-something myself, and during the early days of the pandemic I wrote an open letter to my generation explaining why they should be staying away from crowded beaches and staying home. I cited reliable facts and figures about the pandemic and, pointing to Italy, warned of the consequences of not taking it seriously. 
After it was picked up by CNN, my letter reached a national audience. In the face of conflicting public health advice, I hoped that highlighting the data itself would change hearts and minds. 
Five months later, it is clear that neither my piece nor the many Covid-19 public health dashboards have persuaded many of my peers. I'm struggling to understand why. 
This is not just wounded pride. Young people between 20 and 40 are a significant portion of the growing number of cases, and many more may be contagious even if they don't show any symptoms. If we want to stop the virus and re-open our schools, shops and restaurants, we need to get young people on board with masks and social distancing. 
Why aren't facts enough to do this? I don't have definitive answers. But with five months to ponder it, I have some ideas.
First, public health campaigns that promote total elimination of risk don't work well -- especially for young people. Think about abstinence-only sex education. 
It's been proven to be ineffective. But it's also associated with worse outcomes because it deprives kids of opportunities to understand how to reduce risks if they do choose to have sex. Similarly, simply bombarding young people with #StayHome memes likely won't eliminate risky behavior. 
In fact, a 30-year-old man who thought Covid-19 was a hoax recently died after attending a ""Covid party"" in Texas. Clearly, some young people are not getting good information on mitigating risk. 
We're actually in a worse position than those teaching abstinence-only sex education, because unlike the risk of STDs or teen pregnancy, the risk of Covid-19 was unknown just a few months ago. 
The pandemic has progressed with speed and -- given the mixed messaging from public officials -- chaos. It's no surprise that when we tell young people they can either stay at home or risk serious danger by leaving the house, they choose to leave the house.
Secondly, peer pressure during quarantine is enormous. I feel it daily. How can so many people be posting about their trip to the lake, dinners at fancy restaurants and ""darties"" -- daytime parties -- while I sit at home? 
Lastly, young people have always had a strong sense of invincibility. Gary L. Wenk, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Ohio State University, reports that feelings of immortality hinge on the fact that their frontal lobes are not fully developed, or myelinated. This process is completed between the ages of 25 and 30.
People see more of their mortality as they age -- young people simply aren't primed for death. And during a pandemic, that's a problem. 
So how can we apply these ideas to change behavior? 
One idea is to focus on a harm reduction model, which has successfully reduced teen pregnancies and substance abuse. Rather than an abstinence-only approach to the pandemic -- never leave the house, always wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from others -- we can recognize that some people, especially younger ones, are going to take risks whether we like it or not. 
Instead of telling them to ""STAY HOME FOREVER,"" we can help young people understand what activities are safer -- biking with a few friends, hiking, getting take-out food -- versus what are more dangerous: house parties with lots of people and swimming in crowded public pools. 
We can also try to turn peer pressure into a force for good. Studies show that peer influence can be a powerful tool in decreasing risky behavior among youth. For example, students with friends who use substances are more likely to increase their use. Conversely, after they participated in a peer-led substance abuse program, they reduced their use. 
Instead of shaming young people for following the crowd, we can encourage them to create an environment in which putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 is against the norm. Some are already doing this. Just look at these TikToks of family quarantine hijinks -- including both young and old alike -- and Instagram posts of #quarantinecooking homemade meals (yum). 
Lastly, research on invincibility shows that we can make the risks of Covid-19 real by sharing fewer statistics and long-term consequences and showing more immediate, personal stories. 
We can start with the last words the 30-year-old man who attended the ""Covid party"" reportedly told his nurse: ""I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax, but it's not."" 
The last five months notwithstanding, I continue to believe that the more people understand about Covid-19, the more lives will be saved. And I continue to hope that through reaching young people (who are often trendsetters), we will be able to also influence the wider population and not just flatten the curve but crush it."

The problem is that they've not been easily accessible in one searchable database, which means it might take callers or texters reaching out for help longer to find the resources they need. 
A new website launched Tuesday by the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition aims to change that. Its goal is to make mental health support a click away for people who are struggling with their emotional and mental wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The ability to access mental health crisis services is critical at this time, yet COVID-19 is impacting the typical ways people receive help in a crisis,"" Travis Atkinson, president of the Crisis Residential Association and co-chair of the American Association of Suicidologys Crisis Services Committee, said in a statement.  
Atkinson noted that emergency rooms, where patients might seek care for suicidal thinking and behavior or a panic attack, are focused on treating COVID-19 patients. At the same time, psychiatric hospitals are decreasing their capacity in order to follow social distancing guidelines. ""[P]eople need to know how to access available mental health services,"" Atkinson said.
The new site debuted with a database of crisis services searchable by state, contact method, support type, topics, and categories. Someone in New York, for example, could search for text-based services staffed by counselors with experience talking about anxiety. In addition to anxiety, topics include bullying, gambling, parenting, and substance use. There are several categories that focus on demographics like gender, veteran status, age, and sexuality. 
Example of a search on the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition website.

SEE ALSO: Why suicide risk may increase as we cope with COVID-19
The database includes contact information for hundreds of helplines and community centers, whose volunteers and staff are trained to connect callers with local mental health providers and resources. The site also includes articles on coping with the effects of COVID-19, tips for how to help a loved one, and information specifically for frontline workers who want mental health support. 
The Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition is a group of international mental health organizations that banded together in March in order to create the site. Its members include Crisis Text Line, the American Association of Suicidology, The Trevor Project, and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing emotional distress, you can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline by calling 1-800-985-5990 or texting TalkWithUs to 66746. The helpline, which is operated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, specializes in helping people who are experiencing emotional distress related to any natural or human-caused disaster."

, travel and sustainability experts Sarah Kaufman
, Mark Chambers
, Dr. Lucy Mahoney, and environmental activist Ashley Renne
 joined a livestream on July 22 to discuss the future of travel and transportation post-pandemic. 
The Social Good Series is a six-month project in which issues essential to making the world a better place are covered and discussed at Mashable. July's theme was sustainability, and in addition to publishing a host of fascinating
 and helpful
 stories, Mashable hosted its first-ever livestream event (which you can watch in its entirety here).  
NEXT STORY: 
Kaufman, the associate director of the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, kicked off the livestream by pointing out there's been an interest in the implications of travel throughout the pandemic, particularly as people saw the potential
 climate benefits of reduced and modified travel. 
That attention shouldn't trickle off after social distancing measures are over: Pandemic or not, the climate crisis rages on. A focus on transportation, which Kaufman noted is a top source of emissions
, will remain absolutely crucial in the climate fight. 
Panelists discussed why we need to make sure transportation-related climate solutions also build a more equitable post-COVID world. 
""This year, 2020, is turning out to be the year for collective action. We know that our cities need to be inclusive and resilient,"" Mahoney said, adding that we need to ensure our transport systems and our streets are welcoming ""for all ages, genders, ethnicities, incomes, [and] abilities."" 
Chambers, the director of the mayor's office of sustainability in New York City, spoke about how the city, despite its well-known subway system, is ultimately a city made for cars
 and this has disastrous health impacts for people of color and low-income individuals. 
""We're designed for cars, not for people,"" Chambers said, noting that the current configuration of the city makes it so that communities of color and low-income communities are often the ones closest to roadways and thus bear the brunt of negative impacts from excessive travel. 
To emerge from the pandemic more inclusive and more sustainable, Chambers says that addressing those two issues excessive emissions from transportation and racial injustice is the core of what New York City aims to do as it builds out more sustainable transportation options throughout the city. 
""That's the big underpinning where we recognize we have to be tackling the social infrastructure simultaneously with the transportation infrastructure,"" Chambers said."

Although veteran L.A. Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke had for months vigilantly ""abandoned"" any group settings where the new coronavirus flourishes, he acknowledged recently letting his guard down. And COVID-19 hit him hard. In his first column in almost two weeks, Plaschke said he dined out with friends in a couple of lawful, socially-distanced outdoor environments where the masks inevitably came off. Plaschke thinks he got infected there. 
Though the now-recovering journalist wasn't hospitalized, Plaschke wrote his piece to share that even a healthy person without a heightened vulnerability (like older age or health conditions) can get pummeled by a disease that presently has no proven cure nor a vaccine. 
The microbial parasite is around. It's part of our lives. Experts don't expect the virus to magically disappear. And COVID-19 doesn't just bring intense physical woes.
""Nobody tells you about the dread,"" wrote Plaschke. ""From the moment my doctor phoned me with the test results, to the moment I am writing this column, I have been scared out of my mind.""
While sick, Plaschke knew fatality rates were low  though experts know the rate of death is substantially higher than the common flu
 and the virus has killed over 166,000 Americans as of Aug. 13  and that he was an otherwise healthy person. But that couldn't quell the understandable anxiety.
""It doesnt matter,"" Plaschke continued. ""Once you realize you have a virus that could kill you and theres nothing anybody can do about it, you live in constant fear.""
Fear is reasonable, considering SARS-CoV-2 is still a relatively newly emerged human pathogen. That means our population has little to no natural immunity. 
 ""It has everyone on the planet to attack,"" Dan Janies, a professor of bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who researches viruses, told Mashable in May.
We cant let up in our fight against COVID-19. 
Your mask matters. It protects you and those around you. Please wear one every time you leave your home.
 MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) August 13, 2020
So our bodies have to fight a new infection, and the course of disease can be rough, or deadly. I encourage you to read Plaschke's full, lurid account for more about a coronavirus experience that didn't require hospitalization, but was terrible, nonetheless. Here are some of his experiences:
<ul><li>""It felt like my head was on fire. One night I sweated through five shirts. I shook so much from the chills I thought I chipped a tooth. My chest felt like LeBron James was sitting on it. My fatigue made it feel as if I was dressed in the chains of Jacob Marleys ghost. I coughed so hard it felt like I broke a rib.""
</li><li>""I would fall asleep in a chair and wake up terrified from a hallucinatory dream where I was chased through a playground by old women with giant heads.""
</li><li>At night: ""You start coughing into a wet pillow and you cant stop and your breath becomes ragged and your bed is soaking and you wonder, is now the time? Do you try to drive yourself to the hospital? Do you call an ambulance? Are you just being a baby? You cant call any friends or family for help because they cant be exposed. You cant call your doctor because hes already told you theres nothing he can do.""
</li></ul>Plaschke certainly wasn't acting outwardly reckless, like attending a crowded Smash Mouth show in Sturgis, South Dakota, on Sunday. But the virus still bit. 
Wear those masks diligently, emphasize infectious disease experts. ""We are not defenseless against COVID-19, CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield said in a statement
. Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.""
The virus relies on hosts us to spread. The microbes can't survive and travel around communities without us. Many regions of the U.S. have seen surging cases this summer. It's out there. Stay vigilant.
""This is a virus that we know is very happy to take advantage of people being careless,"" Dr. Vince Silenzio, an M.D. and professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told Mashable
 in May."

The website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) usually contains a trove of publicly available data about health issues. During the coronavirus crisis, the COVID-19 data published on the site has been a crucial source for researchers and experts studying the pandemic as well as journalists tracking and publicizing the virus' spread.
The Trump administration is changing that. The website will no longer publish and make data available to the public on some key coronavirus metrics, CNN reports. 
The website edit comes thanks to a Trump administration policy change. On Tuesday, the government announced that hospitals should no longer send their daily COVID-19 reports on patients, equipment, and capacity to the CDC. Instead, hospitals are to send the data to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
The Trump administration says the change is a way of reorganizing and consolidating the data. However, unlike data sent to the CDC, what's submitted to the HHS won't be available to the public. 
The data that will no longer appear on the COVID-19 module of the website, according to CNN, is: ""current inpatient and intensive care unit bed occupancy, health care worker staffing, and personal protective equipment supply status and availability.""
Experts are alarmed by the change, saying that removing the data from public view indicates that the Trump administration may restrict and politicize health information. Throughout the pandemic, Trump's stance has been to downplay the disease that has so far killed some 138,000 Americans. Despite a current surge in cases, Trump is currently pushing to re-open schools in the fall, even though his own health experts strongly advise against it.
Typically, the CDC is more politically independent than the HHS. Indeed, the current director of the CDC has advocated strongly for a universal mask-wearing policy, while the Trump administration has equivocated on the issue. Meanwhile, the current head of HHS is seen as a Trump stalwart who has led initiatives restricting Medicaid and protecting health-care workers who decline to provide contraception on the basis of religious beliefs.
Just another sunny day in America, people!"

On Monday, Michael Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, tested positive for antibodies for Covid-19. While it's now been months since CES was held, he'd fallen ill shortly after coming back from the convention in January.
The report goes on to note that he wasn't the only one who felt sick shortly after attending CES. APM Reports spoke to multiple attendees who confirmed they also felt sick after the conference though they're still waiting on results for antibody tests.
Additionally, the report highlights a number of tweets in which people complained about feeling under the weather just days after the conference ended.
At the time, reports of CES-related illness didn't seem like such a big deal, though. After all, CES is known for being hectic at all hours of the day. It's also common to get sick afterwards. Every year people complain about the dreaded ""CES flu.""
People are traveling, attending back-to-back meetings during the day and events at night, walking the floors of a packed convention center, and not sleeping enough. You're also shaking hands with everyone you meet and touching devices that hordes of other people are also touching. It's almost impossible not to get sick. 
But this year, the ""CES flu"" was a little different because people appeared to be suffering from similar symptoms: fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, aches, and pains. You know, everything that comes with having Covid-19. 
Webber told the publication that his ""revelation comes at the same time that public health officials in Northern California, including Silicon Valley, reported three newly confirmed coronavirus deaths."" 
Seeing as how one of those deaths happened in early February, it means the virus might've started spreading in the United States earlier than predicted.
And, according to what's been gathered, the Vegas convention was an ""ideal environment for the virus to spread."" In addition to the United States, there are at least 63 other countries that attend CES each year. 
APM Reports also says a little more than 100 people attended this year's conference from Wuhan, China where the first outbreak was recorded towards the end of 2019. 
But CES organizers told APM Reports there haven't been any confirmed cases of Covid-19 from the conference. They also have yet to be contacted by any health, government, or corporate officials with suspicions that someone might've been exposed to the virus at the conference.
While it's a start, it'll certainly take more research to figure out if CES actually helped to spread the disease throughout the country. 
Regardless, CES is still pushing on. The Consumer Technology Association confirmed that next year's show is still scheduled as planned for January 2021. 
Whether or not anyone attends after all of this remains to be seen."

However, Colleen Tressler, Consumer Education Specialist at the FTC, is warning that scammers are now using contact tracing as a cover for targeting consumers via their mobile devices.
Getting in touch with people who have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 is usually initiated via a text message. But in a post on the FTC website, Tressler warns, ""scammers, pretending to be contact tracers and taking advantage of how the process works, are also sending text messages. But theirs are spam text messages that ask you to click a link.""
Sure enough, if you don't spot the scam and click the link you're likely taking the first step towards having unwanted software installed on your device. After that, your personal and financial details are vulnerable to being stolen. With that in mind, the FTC is telling everyone to ""Don't take the bait,"" remain vigilante, and take action to protect themselves. That means filtering out text messages from unknown senders if you can, enabling two-factor authentication on all online accounts that offer the feature, and always installing the latest available updates for your device(s).

Unveiled on Wednesday, the Fitbit Flow is an ""easy-to-use, and low-cost"" emergency ventilator designed in consultation with healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients. Based on manual resuscitator bags used by paramedics, the ventilator features various sensors to help monitor patients, and allows the pressure and volume of oxygen delivery to be controlled. The Fitbit Flow also has a clear window through which healthcare workers can view the automated resuscitator bag being pumped.
It isn't a long-term solution conventional ventilators are still sorely needed. Instead, the Fitbit Flow is intended to act as a temporary stopgap keeping patients alive until they can be put on a standard machine.
""We know from some conversations that physicians are already trying to work out the ethics in deciding who gets the ventilator and who doesnt, due to shortage of supply,"" said Dr. Tony Faranesh, a Fitbit research scientist who helped develop the ventilator. ""The goal here is to support life in the event that ones not available until one might become available.""
The FDA has already authorised the Fitbit Flow for emergency use during the pandemic where conventional ventilators aren't available. 
The Fitbit Flow has a modular stand, enabling it to be used with O2 tanks of various sizes.

Fitbit has stated it intends to use its existing infrastructure to quickly manufacture ""large volumes"" of these devices. The company has no plans to continue manufacturing ventilators after the current health crisis passes though this is only a temporary shift in focus.
""COVID-19 has challenged all of us to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity, and use everything at our disposal to more rapidly develop products that support patients and the healthcare systems caring for them,"" said Fitbit CEO James Park.
""We saw an opportunity to rally our expertise in advanced sensor development, manufacturing, and our global supply chain to address the critical and ongoing need for emergency ventilators and help make a difference in the fight against this global virus.""

While the term has already been employed by many medical professionals, the WHO has avoided an official declaration before now.
The organization officially defines pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease,” noting that viruses that have caused past pandemics typically originated from animal influenza viruses, which appears to the be the case with this novel coronavirus. Notably, the pandemic classification has to do more with the geographical reach of a disease, rather than the specific severity of the condition. 
Consensus among officials is that the situation likely to continue to get worse before it improves.

The World Health Organization said as of Thursday’s situation report that the coronavirus has resulted in 125,000 confirmed cases and 4,613 deaths.
FireEye said it has seen an uptick in targeted spearphishing campaigns from hackers in China, North Korea and Russia, to deliver malware. Ben Read, a senior manager in FireEye’s intelligence analysis unit, said all of the campaigns it has witnessed have leveraged the coronavirus as a lure to compromise their victims’ computers.
Recorded Future has also observed a number of cybercriminals using the coronavirus to spread a number of different types of malware against targets in the U.S., Europe and and Iran three areas most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak outside of China, where the new coronavirus strain first emerged. The researchers found that some of these campaigns imitate “trusted” organizations like the World Health Organization and the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to infect their victims.
And Check Point, which last month found a number of coronavirus-themed disinformation campaigns, now says it has found a new malware campaign leveraging the fear of the outbreak to surreptitiously install a powerful remote access trojan designed to take full control of a victim’s computer.
But researchers say that attackers aren’t just using the coronavirus as a cover for spreading malware.
Email security firm Agari told TechCrunch that it has evidence of what appears to be the first case of a coronavirus-themed business email compromise attack, designed to trick businesses into turning over money.
While Agari said it has seen several coronavirus-related emails used to deliver spam, steal credentials and infect victims with malware, the company said it has seen a threat group it calls Ancient Tortoise using spoofed emails in an effort to trick a victim company’s customers to pay an outstanding balance but to a different bank than usual, “due to the coronavirus outbreak.” The different bank is a mule account based in Hong Kong, said Agari researchers.
As governments and companies scramble to contain the pandemic, security researchers are trying to better understand and detect the current spike in malware. And as long as the threat from the coronavirus remains, so will the risk from hackers."

The European Commission confirmed its first cases of coronavirus last week, after a staffer at the European Defence Agency and another at the Council of the European Union tested positive. The former had recently returned from Northern Italy, while the latter is reported to have picked up the virus via local transmission in Belgium.
In the email sent to European Parliament staff yesterday its administrative body gives authorization for all staff with “known pre-existing illnesses to stay home and apply for teleworking”.
Parliament staff who have traveled to a high risk zone for the spread of the infection — listed in the email as: China, Hong Kong, Macau, South-Korea, Singapore, Iran, Japan and regions of Northern Italy — had previously been instructed to self isolate for 14 days after returning from a trip.
The email includes some smaller “local clusters” — namely, in France: the Departments of Oise, Haute-Savoie, Morbihan and Haut-Rhin; and in Germany: Landkreis Heinsberg in North Rhine-Westphalia — as active enough to also merit self isolation.
“If during the last 14 days you have been in one of the areas or clusters that have been added, you must stay at home for 14 days following your return,” is the latest instruction to parliament staff. “That also applies if you might already have been back in the office after your return.”
Those staff who have been teleworking for 14 days already after a trip are told they can return to the office — “provided that you have absolutely no symptoms and none of your family members has been infected”.
The email also reiterates guidance that staff who feel ill or unwell should self isolate at home — urging those who may have some flu-like symptoms but do not feel too unwell to work to “ask for teleworking”.
Activities not linked to core functions of the parliament were also cancelled for three weeks as of March 3, with visitor access from affected regions also locked down.
In a separate coronavirus-related email sent to staff of the European Commission yesterday, commissioner Johannes Hahn reiterates the importance of employees taking precautionary measures — such as high standards of hand hygiene, replacing missions with video-conference and “no more handshaking or kissing”.
“I encourage you to follow these measures as they help to protect all of us,” he writes. “I wish to recall our basic principle that staff who have symptoms should stay at home.”
Per this email, Commission staff in Italy are continuing to be offered teleworking options with what Hahn describes as “the needed flexibility in those exceptional circumstances in line with the host countries measures”.
While staff returning from trips to affected regions of Northern Italy are “invited to telework for 14 days on their return”. Although the email notes that this decree does not apply retroactively — and staff who returned to work last week from one of the affected regions are specifically told they can come to work.
“You are invited to monitor your health status until 14 days after you returned. If you develop any symptoms, you should stay at home,” is the alternative suggestion.
The memo to Commission staff also makes reference to a Commission staffer who tested positive last week.
“Let me underline that necessary precautionary measures were already taken last week to protect the colleague and others - and I can reassure you that we will continue doing so. As we are all taking part in public life, nobody can exclude that more colleagues might be affected in the future. Therefore, I invite you all to deal with these situations with care and comprehension,” Hahn writes.
The email also highlights a two-day school closure at an unnamed European school which was waiting for test results of one child. In that case the test was negative, and the school will reopen this week, but Hahn adds: “Naturally, flexible working arrangements will be facilitated in such cases.”
We’ve reached out to the European Commission with additional questions on its approach to tackling COVID-19 — including asking whether it has any contingency plans to expand teleworking to additional staff."

In a brief statement before the press corps, the president hinted at a possible payroll tax cut and emergency support for businesses looking to guarantee that hourly workers are protected from job loss and lost wages as social distancing becomes recommended practice in response to the spread of COVID-19.
“We’re going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to miss a paycheck,” the president said. “So that they dont get penalized for something thats not their fault.”
Trump intends to speak with representatives of the Small Business Administration to create potential loans for small businesses affected by response efforts from federal, state and local governments.
“This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at the briefing.
The president left the podium without responding to reporters’ questions about whether he had been tested for COVID-19, after reports surfaced earlier today that several members of Congress who had met with the president had been exposed to the disease last week at a gathering of national conservative leadership.
Vice President Mike Pence then outlined the latest steps from the U.S. government to respond to the spread of the disease while emphasizing most Americans’ risk of contracting the disease remained low.
“The risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low and the risk of serious disease also remains low,” the vice president said yet again. 
Meanwhile, the American private health industry is working overtime to develop vaccines, treatments and diagnostic testing tools to buttress the work being done in national laboratories.
As more private tools come to market, the question will be who will ultimately foot the bill for treatment of the disease as it spreads.
Some epidemiologists contend that the U.S. remains unprepared for the severity of the disease’s spread, and that even a good scenario means that millions of Americans will be sickened and need some sort of consultation or care.

The government’s response to stabilize markets follows the advice laid out in a series of policy suggestions from the International Monetary Fund and advocated by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, who has returned to the private sector as a managing director of the venture capital firm NEA.
2/2 At the same time, we must provide direct economic assistance to cities, states, people burdened with hardship to compensate for large costs of strong mitigation steps and give cities more latitude to adopt such measures. The national interest depends on strong local actions.

Virtual School Day offers more than 20 hours of live, online classes across a variety of core subjects for students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Each class is taught by one of Varsity Tutors’ expert tutors, who has experience both teaching the subject matter but also giving instruction virtually.
Core classes include K-12 math (from arithmetic to calculus), reading, literature, writing and K-12 science (biology, chemistry, physics), as well as a handful of other sessions. For example, Virtual School Day offers study hall sessions with expert tutors in math, science and English for students who want to focus on certain subjects.
Virtual School Day will also have special sessions for each age group, including The Story of Your Favorite Fairy Tales and Secrets of Staying Healthy for elementary students, The Science of Pandemics and Video Game Sound Design for middle schoolers, and History of the National Parks and Careers in Science for high schoolers.
Over the past year, Varsity Tutors has leaned hard into online classes. The company acquired Veritas Prep in January 2019 to expand further into online classes. Since launch, Varsity Tutors had been focused on one-to-one tutoring sessions, originally in person and, eventually, on-demand online through live video chat.
The company developed an app and added whiteboard functionality, doc editing and other tools to its tutoring suite.
With more than $100 million in funding, Varsity Tutors has been able to expand its product suite beyond tutoring to live, online courses as well as free test prep courses for SAT and ACT.
Here’s what Varsity Tutors Chief Academic Officer, Brian Galvin, had to say about Virtual School Day in a prepared statement:
The massive number of school closures presents a daunting challenge for both students and parents. While some schools are offering online education, most are sending kids home with minimal self-guided homework or no school resources at all. Parents are rightly worried about their students sliding academically, and having their kids time consumed by video games or other empty calorie entertainment. By providing free, high quality resources that enable students to maintain academic momentum during this difficult time, we hope to remove a key source of stress for families worldwide.
All Virtual School Day classes are in English and available internationally. Parents interested in checking it out can learn more at this webinar on Tuesday, March 17th at 8pm EDT."

The smart ring startup is working with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) on a new study to see if its device can help detect early physiological sings that might indicate the onset of COVID-19.
This study will include two parts: Around 2,000 frontline healthcare professionals will get Our rings to wear during the study. The rings track a users’s body temperature continuously, as well as their sleep patterns, heart rate and activity levels. Fever is a common and early symptom that could indicate COVID-19, and a continuously updated body temperature reading could detect fever very early. That’s not enough to confirm a case of COVID-19, of course, but the purpose of the study is to determine whether the range of readings Oura’s ring tracks might, taken together and with other signals, be useful in some kind of early detection effort.
There’s good reason why researches believe that Oura could be used in early detection: An Oura user in Finland alerted him to the fact that he was ill before he was displaying any overt symptoms of the virus, prompting him to get tested (relatively easy in that country). Test results confirmed that while asymptomatic, he had indeed contracted COVID-19. As a result, UCSF researcher Dr. Ashley Mason hypothesizes that the Oura ring could anticipate COVID-19 onset by as many as two to three days before the onset of more obvious symptoms, like coughing.
Being able to detect the presence of the virus in an individual early is key to global containment efforts, but even more important when it comes to frontline healthcare workers. The earlier a frontline responder is diagnosed, the less chance that they expose their colleagues or others they’re working around in close quarters.
In addition to the Oura rings being provided to study participants, the plan is to expand it to include Oura’s general user population, meaning its over 150,000 global users can opt in to participate and add to the overall poor of available information with their ring’s readings and daily symptom surveys. For existing Oura users, it’s a relatively low-lift way to contribute to the global effort to combat the pandemic without even leaving the house."

Calls for EU citizens to self isolate to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is driving major demand for video appointments, it said.
The platform — Care Connect by Kry — is launching in Europe, with ten languages supported initially, but will shortly be opening up worldwide. CEO and co-founder, Johannes Schildt, told us it’ll be launching in North America within a matter of “days”. 
Last week US regulators relaxed rules around the use of telehealth platforms for delivering a broader range of healthcare services — opening up the market for remote consultations during the coronavirus crisis.
“We are working extremely hard at all levels because this is time critical,” said Schildt. “We want to get this out there as soon as we possibly can. Today we’re launching it in Europe, we’re aiming to have it available within days in the US and Canada.”
The web-based platform for healthcare professionals to carry out encrypted video consultations does not require a Kry account. Instead doctors sign up (and in) with an email address and are able to send a one-time SMS link to a patient’s mobile phone number — which the patient then clicks on to begin a video consultation with the doctor from their smartphone. 
Kry says the clinicians email will never be shared with the patient. 
“We have been doing this for a long time but now it’s more important than ever that you have as many as possible of the current consultations now happening in physical locations are moved to digital,” said Schildt. “It’s for all clinicians, for anyone that’s run their own practice — to enable them to move their consultations to video in an easy way.”
He said Kry has seen demand for its commercial video-chat-with-a-doctor roughly doubling in recent weeks as Europeans seek alternatives for accessing primary care during the coronavirus crisis.   
“We’ve seen a big increase in demand… from patients. But a lot of that is also not driven by COVID-19 specific things — it’s everything else,” he told TechCrunch. “Obviously you have a new virus that is spreading but you also have a lack of access to GP practices and traditional healthcare — because a lot of traditional primary care is closing down. So you still have a lot of people that have urinary track infections, eye infections, skin conditions and other things that we can help with.
“So we see a big uplift in all symptoms. What’s also very encouraging to see is that we see a big uplift in older patients… understanding the benefits of digital healthcare. Usually when we’re launching in new markets the first cohort is the young and slightly more tech savvy population.”
Schildt said Kry is recruiting clinicians “all across Europe” to cope with increased demand. 
“We’re getting a lot of senior, retired clinicians,” he told us. “We’re unlocking a lot of underused talent so we now have a lot of retired doctors joining and helping out. And they should obviously not be in an intensive care unit or at the primary healthcare center where they risk getting the disease because they are old and might be fragile but they’re usually very, very senior doctors. 
“We’re also getting a lot of doctors who are on parental leave or part time sick leave and so on. So it’s a massive exercise for us now across all our European markets.”
The 2015-founded startup has served up some 1.6 million digital doctors appointments across Europe at this stage. It said it will offer training to doctors signing up to Care Connect on how to carry out remote consultations — given many may be doing so for the first time.
While the intent with Care Connect is to support heavily burdened public healthcare services during the coronavirus pandemic, there’s clearly scope for Kry to turn the platform into an additional revenue-generating service in future — once some of the doctors it onboards now for free have become comfortable using it.
Although Schildt emphasizes that’s not why they’ve scrambled to get the product out there right now. 
“We’re building this because we feel a huge responsibility to help out,” he said. “I think that everybody has a responsibility to help out. And what we can do of course in the market that we’re in we are working super hard on all levels and we’re working very closely with different governments in the markets that we’re in — but this is also a way for us to help out in the markets where we currently don’t have our own medical staff.
“So this is a solution that could be helpful in Spain, Italy, and in other markets around the globe.”
Kry has more products to help fight COVID-19 in the pipeline — and has already launched a symptom-checker for the disease within its existing apps for patients (aka Kry, or Livi) in all its European markets. It’s also doing some home-monitoring partnerships for patients who are in quarantine, per Schildt.
He won’t be drawn on what else it’s working on — noting it’s “working very closely with some of the European governments”. “In some of those cases they have specifically asked us not to be specific about what we’re doing,” he said. 
Asked about how else it’s using symptom data generated by use of its services, he said it’s sharing aggregated data with existing paying customers, such as the UK’s National Health Service (NHS).
He also told us European governments are keen to get access to data that might help them track how the coronavirus is spreading.
“Obviously this is really interesting data — at an aggregated level — as we can see where you have symptoms starting to spread. And obviously as a big partner to some of the largest payers of healthcare in the world — [e.g.] European governments — we are monitoring this very closely together with them,” said Schildt.
“We can see in real time, more or less, where you have different symptoms that are trending — and we already, before you had the big COVID-19 outbreak, you could see that viral infections and upper respiratory infections started to trend in a bit unusual way compared to last year. And that data we’re also sharing with our main [healthcare customers, including the UK’s NHS] to help their staff understand demand.”"

“If people needed more proof that local journalism is a vital public service, they’re getting it now,” said Campbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships, in a blog post. “And while almost all businesses are facing adverse financial effects from this crisis, we recognize we’re in a more privileged position than most, and we want to help.”

The Nigeria headquartered operation with online goods and services verticals in 11 African countries announced a series of measures on Friday. Jumia will donate certified face masks to health ministries in Kenya, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria and Uganda, drawing on its supply networks outside Africa.
The company has offered African governments use of of its last mile delivery network for distribution of supplies to healthcare facilities and workers. Jumia will also reduce fees on its JumiaPay finance product to encourage digital payments over cash, which can be a conduit for the spread of coronavirus.
Governments in Jumia’s operating countries have started to engage the private sector on a possible COVID-19 outbreak on the continent, according to Jumia CEO Sacha Poignonnec .
“I don’t have a crystal ball and no one knows what’s gonna happen,” he told TechCrunch on a call. But in the event the virus spreads rapidly on the continent, Jumia is reviewing additional assets it can offer the public sector. “If governments find it helpful we’re willing to do it,” Poignonnec said.
Africa’s COVID-19 cases by country were in the single digits until recently, but those numbers spiked last week leading the World Health Organization to sound an alarm. “About 10 days ago we had 5 countries affected, now we’ve got 30,” WHO Regional Director Dr Matshidiso Moeti said at a press conference Thursday. “It’s has been an extremely rapid…evolution.” 
By the World Health Organizations latest stats Monday there were 1321 COVID-19 cases in Africa and 34 confirmed deaths related to the virus up from 463 cases and 10 deaths last Wednesday.
Dr. Moeti noted that many socioeconomic factors in Africa from housing to access to running water make common measures to curb COVID-19, such as social-distancing or frequent hand washing, challenging. She went on to explain that the World Health Organization is looking for solutions that are adoptable to Africa’s circumstances, including working with partners and governments to get sanitizing materials to hospitals and families.
As coronavirus cases and related deaths grow, governments in Africa are responding. South Africa, which has the second highest COVID-19 numbers on the continent, declared a national disaster last week, banned public gatherings and announced travel restrictions on the U.S.
Kenya has imposed its own travel and crowd restrictions and the country’s President Uhuru Kenyatta urged citizens and businesses to opt for digital-payments as a safer means for transactions.
Across Africa’s tech ecosystem which has seen significant growth in startups and now receives $2 billion in VC annually a number of actors are stepping up.

In addition to offering its logistics and supply-chain network, Jumia is collaborating with health ministries in several countries to use its website and mobile platforms to share COVID-19 related public service messages.
Heeding President Kenyatta’s call, last week Kenya’s largest telecom Safaricom waived fees on its M-Pesa mobile-money product (with over 20 million users) to increase digital payments use and lower the risk of spreading the COVID-19 through handling of cash.
Africa’s largest innovation incubator CcHub announced funding and a call for tech projects aimed at reducing COVID-19 and its social and economic impact.
A looming question for Africa’s tech scene is how startups in major markets such as Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa will weather major drops in revenue that could occur from a wider coronavirus outbreak.
Jumia is well capitalized, after going public in a 2019 IPO on the New York stock exchange, but still has losses exceeding its 2019 revenue of 160 million.
On managing business through a possible COVID-19 Africa downturn, “We’re very long-term oriented so it’s about doing what’s right with the governments and thinking about how we can help,” said Jumia’s CEO Sacha Poignonnec.
“Revenue wise, it’s really to early to tell. We do believe that e-commerce in Africa is a trend that goes beyond this particular situation.”"

But Moderna, which is behind the first potential vaccine to enter human clinical trials in the U.S., provided new info on Monday that indicates it will seek to provide access to the vaccine by as early as this fall, to a limited group likely consisting of healthcare workers.
The company will look at possibly doing so under an emergency use authorization from eh Food and Drug Administration, which is similar to how certain testing procedures are being granted approval for use now, bypassing the typical process under which such diagnostic tools are given the go-ahead. Moderna’s solution which was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is already the fastest potential vaccine to enter the human clinical trial phase.
Their proposed vaccine makes use of messenger RNA, rather than relying on either a small or inactive sample of the COVID-19 virus itself the source of most existing effective vaccines. The mRNA method means that there is no actual virus introduced to subjects who receive it, which in turn means that they are not at risk of actually contracting the virus form the vaccine itself, which can be an issue in the testing and development phase of any traditional virus-based immune therapy.
Last Monday, Moderna began providing the vaccine to volunteer participants in the first phase of its human clinical trial in Washington state. Despite the speed with which it entered human testing, and the unconventional bypass of the animal testing phase, commercial availability is still at least a year away. But select, limited use for healthcare professionals at an accelerated timetable could help provide additional protection for frontline workers who are risking greater exposure to curtail the pandemic’s spread provided Moderna’s vaccine is effective, and proves safe in its current human testing.
Moderna’s solution works by convincing the body to generate proteins that resemble the virus but that are harmless, and provoke antibodies that is effective both in fighting off the protein and the actual virus itself. There are other RNA-based vaccines in development, as well as other types of immune treatments, but only Moderna’s has reached the clinical trial phase thus far. The Boston-based company has been working on mRNA-based treatments for cancer cells, and went public in December 2018."

But what about pre-schoolers who are missing out?
Pre-school children are sponges for information but dont get formal training on reading and writing until they enter the classroom when they are less sponge-like and surrounded by 30 other children. Things are tougher for non-English speaking children who’s parents want them to learn English.
Lingumi, a platform aimed at toddlers learning critical skills, has now raised £4 million in a funding round led by China-based technology fund North Summit Capital a fund run by Alibabas former Chief Data Scientist Dr Min Wanli alongside existing investors LocalGlobe, ADV, and Entrepreneur First.
The startup, launched in 2017, is also announcing the launch of daily free activity packs and videos to support children and families during the COVID-19 outbreak, and has pledged to donate 20% of its sales during this period to the Global Children’s Fund.
Lingumis interactive courses offer one-to-one tutoring with a kind social learning and its first course helps introduce key English grammar and vocabulary from the age of 2.
Instead of tuning into live lessons with tutors, which are typically timetabled and expensive, Lingumis lessons are delivered through interactive speaking tasks, teacher videos, and games. At the end of each lesson, children can see videos of Lingumi friends speaking the same words and phrases as them. Because the kids are watching videos, Lingumi is cheaper than live courses, and thus more flexible for parents.
The company launched the first Lingumi course in China last year, focused on teaching spoken English to non-English speakers. The platform is now being used by more than 100,000 families globally, including in mainland China, Taiwan, UK, Germany, Italy, and France. More than 1.5 million English lessons have taken place in China over the past six months, and 40% of active users are also playing lessons daily. Lingumi says its user base grew 50% during Chinas lockdown and it has had a rapid uptake in Europe.
Lingumis rapid expansion in the Chinese market required a strategic local investor, and Dr Min and the team had a clear-sighted understanding of the technology and scale opportunity both in China, and globally.
Dr Wanli Min, general partner at North Summit Capital, commented: It is only the most privileged children who can access native English speakers for one-on-one tutoring… Lingumi has the potential to democratize English learning and offer every kid a personalized curriculum empowered by AI &amp; Lingumis asynchronous teaching; model.
Competitors to include Lingumi include live teaching solutions like VIPKid, and learning platforms like Jiliguala in China, or Lingokids in the West."

China-style individual-level location-tracking of people by states via their smartphones even for a public health purpose is hard to imagine in Europe — which has a long history of legal protection for individual privacy. However the coronavirus pandemic is applying pressure to the region’s data protection model, as governments turn to data and mobile technologies to seek help with tracking the spread of the virus, supporting their public health response and mitigating wider social and economic impacts.
Scores of apps are popping up across Europe aimed at attacking coronavirus from different angles. European privacy not-for-profit, noyb, is keeping an updated list of approaches, both led by governments and private sector projects, to use personal data to combat SARS-CoV-2 — with examples so far including contacts tracing, lockdown or quarantine enforcement and COVID-19 self-assessment.
The efficacy of such apps is unclear — but the demand for tech and data to fuel such efforts is coming from all over the place.
In the UK the government has been quick to call in tech giants, including Google, Microsoft and Palantir, to help the National Health Service determine where resources need to be sent during the pandemic. While the European Commission has been leaning on regional telcos to hand over user location data to carry out coronavirus tracking — albeit in aggregated and anonymized form.
The newly unveiled Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) project is a response to the coronavirus pandemic generating a huge spike in demand for citizens’ data that’s intended to offer not just an another app — but what’s described as “a fully privacy-preserving approach” to COVID-19 contacts tracing.
The core idea is to leverage smartphone technology to help disrupt the next wave of infections by notifying individuals who have come into close contact with an infected person — via the proxy of their smartphones having been near enough to carry out a Bluetooth handshake. So far so standard. But the coalition behind the effort wants to steer developments in such a way that the EU response to COVID-19 doesn’t drift towards China-style state surveillance of citizens.
While, for the moment, strict quarantine measures remain in place across much of Europe there may be less imperative for governments to rip up the best practice rulebook to intrude on citizens’ privacy, given the majority of people are locked down at home. But the looming question is what happens when restrictions on daily life are lifted?
Contacts tracing — as a way to offer a chance for interventions that can break any new infection chains — is being touted as a key component of preventing a second wave of coronavirus infections by some, with examples such as Singapore’s TraceTogether app being eyed up by regional lawmakers.
Singapore does appear to have had some success in keeping a second wave of infections from turning into a major outbreak, via an aggressive testing and contacts-tracing regime. But what a small island city-state with a population of less than 6M can do vs a trading bloc of 27 different nations whose collective population exceeds 500M doesn’t necessarily seem immediately comparable.
Europe isn’t going to have a single coronavirus tracing app. It’s already got a patchwork. Hence the people behind PEPP-PT offering a set of “standards, technology, and services” to countries and developers to plug into to get a standardized COVID-19 contacts-tracing approach up and running across the bloc.
The other very European flavored piece here is privacy — and privacy law. “Enforcement of data protection, anonymization, GDPR [the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation] compliance, and security” are baked in, is the top-line claim.
“PEPP-PR was explicitly created to adhere to strong European privacy and data protection laws and principles,” the group writes in an online manifesto. “The idea is to make the technology available to as many countries, managers of infectious disease responses, and developers as quickly and as easily as possible.
“The technical mechanisms and standards provided by PEPP-PT fully protect privacy and leverage the possibilities and features of digital technology to maximize speed and real-time capability of any national pandemic response.”
Hans-Christian Boos, one of the project’s co-initiators — and the founder of an AI company called Arago –discussed the initiative with German newspaper Der Spiegel, telling it: “We collect no location data, no movement profiles, no contact information and no identifiable features of the end devices.”
The newspaper reports PEPP-PT’s approach means apps aligning to this standard would generate only temporary IDs — to avoid individuals being identified. Two or more smartphones running an app that uses the tech and has Bluetooth enabled when they come into proximity would exchange their respective IDs — saving them locally on the device in an encrypted form, according to the report.
Der Spiegel writes that should a user of the app subsequently be diagnosed with coronavirus their doctor would be able to ask them to transfer the contact list to a central server. The doctor would then be able to use the system to warn affected IDs they have had contact with a person who has since been diagnosed with the virus — meaning those at risk individuals could be proactively tested and/or self-isolate.
On its website PEPP-PT explains the approach thus:
Mode 1If a user is not tested or has tested negative, the anonymous proximity history remains encrypted on the users phone and cannot be viewed or transmitted by anybody. At any point in time, only the proximity history that could be relevant for virus transmission is saved, and earlier history is continuously deleted.
Mode 2If the user of phone A has been confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, the health authorities will contact user A and provide a TAN code to the user that ensures potential malware cannot inject incorrect infection information into the PEPP-PT system. The user uses this TAN code to voluntarily provide information to the national trust service that permits the notification of PEPP-PT apps recorded in the proximity history and hence potentially infected. Since this history contains anonymous identifiers, neither person can be aware of the others identity.
Providing further detail of what it envisages as “Country-dependent trust service operation”, it writes: “The anonymous IDs contain encrypted mechanisms to identify the country of each app that uses PEPP-PT. Using that information, anonymous IDs are handled in a country-specific manner.”
While on healthcare processing is suggests: “A process for how to inform and manage exposed contacts can be defined on a country by country basis.”
Among the other features of PEPP-PT’s mechanisms the group lists in its manifesto are:
<ul><li>Backend architecture and technology that can be deployed into local IT infrastructure and can handle hundreds of millions of devices and users per country instantly.</li><li>Managing the partner network of national initiatives and providing APIs for integration of PEPP-PT features and functionalities into national health processes (test, communication, ) and national system processes (health logistics, economy logistics, ) giving many local initiatives a local backbone architecture that enforces GDPR and ensures scalability.</li><li>Certification Service to test and approve local implementations to be using the PEPP-PT mechanisms as advertised and thus inheriting the privacy and security testing and approval PEPP-PT mechanisms offer.</li></ul>Having a standardized approach that could be plugged into a variety of apps would allow for contacts tracing to work across borders — i.e. even if different apps are popular in different EU countries — an important consideration for the bloc, which has 27 Member States.
However there may be questions about the robustness of the privacy protection designed into the approach — if, for example, pseudonymized data is centralized on a server that doctors can access there could be a risk of it leaking and being re-identified. And identification of individual device holders would be legally risky.
Europe’s lead data regulator, the EDPS, recently made a point of tweeting to warn an MEP (and former EC digital commissioner) against the legality of applying Singapore-style Bluetooth-powered contacts tracing in the EU — writing: “Please be cautious comparing Singapore examples with European situation. Remember Singapore has a very specific legal regime on identification of device holder.”
Dear Mr. Commissioner, please be cautious comparing Singapoore examples with European situation. Remember Singapore has a very specific legal regime on identification of device holder.
— Wojtek Wiewiorowski (@W_Wiewiorowski) March 27, 2020
A spokesman for the EDPS told us it’s in contact with data protection agencies of the Member States involved in the PEPP-PT project to collect “relevant information”.
“The general principles presented by EDPB on 20 March, and by EDPS on 24 March are still relevant in that context,” the spokesman added — referring to guidance issued by the privacy regulators last month in which they encouraged anonymization and aggregation should Member States want to use mobile location data for monitoring, containing or mitigating the spread of COVID-19. At least in the first instance.
“When it is not possible to only process anonymous data, the ePrivacy Directive enables Member States to introduce legislative measures to safeguard public security (Art. 15),” the EDPB further noted.
“If measures allowing for the processing of non-anonymised location data are introduced, a Member State is obliged to put in place adequate safeguards, such as providing individuals of electronic communication services the right to a judicial remedy.”
We reached out to the HHI with questions about the PEPP-PT project and were referred to Boos — but at the time of writing had been unable to speak to him.
“The PEPP-PT system is being created by a multi-national European team,” the HHI writes in a press release about the effort. “It is an anonymous and privacy-preserving digital contact tracing approach, which is in full compliance with GDPR and can also be used when traveling between countries through an anonymous multi-country exchange mechanism. No personal data, no location, no Mac-Id of any user is stored or transmitted. PEPP-PT is designed to be incorporated in national corona mobile phone apps as a contact tracing functionality and allows for the integration into the processes of national health services. The solution is offered to be shared openly with any country, given the commitment to achieve interoperability so that the anonymous multi-country exchange mechanism remains functional.”
“PEPP-PTs international team consists of more than 130 members working across more than seven European countries and includes scientists, technologists, and experts from well-known research institutions and companies,” it adds.
“The result of the teams work will be owned by a non-profit organization so that the technology and standards are available to all. Our priorities are the well being of world citizens today and the development of tools to limit the impact of future pandemics — all while conforming to European norms and standards.”
The PEPP-PT says its technology-focused efforts are being financed through donations. Per its website, it says it’s adopted the WHO standards for such financing — to “avoid any external influence”.
Of course for the effort to be useful it relies on EU citizens voluntarily downloading one of the aligned contacts tracing apps — and carrying their smartphone everywhere they go, with Bluetooth enabled.
Without substantial penetration of regional smartphones it’s questionable how much of an impact this initiative, or any contacts tracing technology, could have. Although if such tech were able to break even some infection chains people might argue it’s not wasted effort.
Notably, there are signs Europeans are willing to contribute to a public healthcare cause by doing their bit digitally — such as a self-reporting COVID-19 tracking app which last week racked up 750,000 downloads in the UK in 24 hours.
But, at the same time, contacts tracing apps are facing scepticism over their ability to contribute to the fight against COVID-19. Not everyone carries a smartphone, nor knows how to download an app, for instance. There’s plenty of people who would fall outside such a digital net.
Meanwhile, while there’s clearly been a big scramble across the region, at both government and grassroots level, to mobilize digital technology for a public health emergency cause there’s arguably greater imperative to direct effort and resources at scaling up coronavirus testing programs — an area where most European countries continue to lag.
Germany — where some of the key backers of the PEPP-PT are from — being the most notable exception."

That’s why it’s uplifting to hear that NASA has issued a call to its entire workforce to come up with potential ways the agency and its resources can contribute to the ongoing effort to with the current coronavirus pandemic.
NASA is using its crowdsourcing platform NASA @ WORK, which it uses to internally source creative solutions to persistent problems, in order to collect creative ideas about new ways to address the COVID-19 crisis and the various problems it presents. Already, NASA is engaged in a few different ways, including offering supercomputing recourses for treatment research, and working on developing AI solutions that can help provide insight into key scientific investigations that are ongoing around the virus.
There is a degree of specificity in the open call NASA put to its workforce: It identified key areas where solutions are most urgently needed, working together with the White House and other government agencies involved in the response, and determined that NASA staff efforts should focus on addressing shortfalls and gaps in the availability of personal protective equipment, ventilation hardware, and ways to monitor and track the coronavirus spread and transmission. That’s not to say NASA doesn’t want to hear solutions about other COVID-19 issues, just that these are the areas where they’ve identified the most current need.
To add some productive time-pressure to this endeavor, NASA is looking for submissions from staff on all the areas above to be made via NASA @ WORK by April 15. Then there’ll be a process of assessing what’s most viable, and allocating resources to make those a reality. Any products or designs that result will be made “open source for any business or country to use,” the agency says with the caveat that this might not be strictly possible in all cases depending on the specific technologies involved."

Today, two major tech companies — Amazon and IBM — each announced programs to encourage developers find solutions to a variety of problems related to the pandemic.
For starters, AWS, Amazon’s cloud arm, announced the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative. It has set aside $20 million, which it will distribute in the form of AWS credits and technical support. The program is designed to assist and encourage teams working on COVID-19 diagnostic issues with the goal of developing better diagnostic tooling.
“In our Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, one area where we have heard an urgent need is in the research and development of diagnostics, which consist of rapid, accurate detection and testing of COVID-19. Better diagnostics will help accelerate treatment and containment, and in time, shorten the course of this epidemic,” Teresa Carlson wrote in the company’s Day One blog today.
The program aims to help customers who are working on building diagnostics solutions to bring products to market more quickly, and also encouraging teams to work together who are working on related problems.
The company also announced, it was forming an advisory group made up of scientists and health policy experts to assist companies involved with initiative.
Meanwhile IBM is refocusing its 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge developer contest on not only solving problem related to global climate change, which was this year’s original charter, but also solving issues around the growing virus crisis by building open source tooling.
“In a very short period of time, COVID-19 has revealed the limits of the systems we take for granted. The 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge will arm you with resources […] to build open source technology solutions that address three main COVID-19 areas: crisis communication during an emergency, ways to improve remote learning, and how to inspire cooperative local communities,” the company wrote in a blog post.
All of these areas are being taxed as more people are forced to stay in-doors as we to try and contain the virus. The company hopes to incentivize developers working on these issues to help solve some of these problems.
During a time of extreme social and economic upheaval when all aspects of society are being affected, businesses, academia and governments need to work together to solve a myriad of problems related to the virus. These are just a couple examples of that."

Shoppers can also cancel batches leading up until they arrive at the store. And if a customer’s entire order is out of stock, Instacart will automatically cancel the order and notify the customer, so that the shopper does not have to contact the support team.
Were continuing to see a surge in demand across our platform as consumers increasingly rely on Instacart as an essential service to get the fresh groceries and household goods they need,” an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement. “As part of this growth, weve built new product features and increased flexibility for shoppers to help them continue delivering for customers during this busy time. We have more shoppers on the platform than ever before and we have the capacity for more people to join Instacart as a flexible earnings opportunity to pick, pack, and deliver groceries. As customer demand continues, our team is working around the clock to best serve shoppers so they can continue being household heroes for families across North America.”
Lastly, Instacart now allows shoppers to use Apple Pay or Google Pay to checkout, and is working with its retail partners to introduce item caps to prevent customers from ordering more than the in-store purchase limits.
These product changes come a few days after Instacart announced it would offer up to two weeks of pay for any shopper who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by a public health authority. In California, some gig workers would rather companies like Instacart, DoorDash and Uber make them W2 employees and offer them benefits like health care, paid sick leave, disability leave and more. Last week, Gig Workers Rising called on California legislators to enforce the new AB-5 law that would ensure companies classify workers as W2 employees instead of independent contractors. It’s worth noting that Instacart is one of the companies working to combat AB5 in a proposed ballot initiative.
“…The occupational accident insurance provisions included in the measure would cover drivers the same as workers compensation insurance covers W2 employees,” a spokesperson for the Protect App-Based Drivers &amp; Services Act told TechCrunch in a statement. “It would cover medical expenses and disability payments for drivers who became ill on the job, either from Coronavirus or another illness. The flexibility, the minimum wage guarantee, the health insurance and the insurance coverage make the ballot measure more imperative now than ever.”"

Uber’s food delivery division said today it’s inked a partnership with supermarket giant Carrefour in France to provide Parisians with 30 minute home delivery on a range of grocery products, including everyday foods, toiletries and cleaning products.
The service is starting with 15 stores in the city, with Uber Eats saying it plans to scale it out rapidly nationwide “in the coming weeks”.
In Spain it’s partnered with the Galp service station brand to offer a grocery delivery service that consists of basic foods, over the counter medicines, beverages and cleaning products in 15 cities across the following 8 provinces: Badajoz, Barcelona, Cádiz, Córdoba, Madrid, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca and Valencia.
Uber Eats said there will be an initial 25 Galp convenience stores participating. The service will not only be offered via the Uber Eats app but also by phone for those without access to a smartphone or Internet.
The third market it’s inked deals in is Brazil, where Uber said it’s partnering with a range of pharmacies, convenience stores and pet shops in Sao Paulo to offer home delivery on basic supplies.
“Over the counter medicines will be available from the Pague Menos chain of pharmacies, grocery products from Shell Select convenience stores and pet supplies from Cobasi — one of the largest pet shop chains in the country,” it said. “The new services will be available on the Uber Eats app, with plans to launch in other Brazil states and cities in the coming weeks.”
The grocery tie-ups are not Uber Eats’ first such deals. The company had already inked partnerships with a supermarket in Australia (Coles) and the Costcutter brand in the UK, where around 600 independent convenience stores are offered via its app.
Uber Eats also lets independent convenience stores in countries around the world self listed on its app. However the latest tie-ups put more branded meat on the bone of its grocery offer in Europe and LatAm — with the Carrefour tie-up in France marking its first partnership with a major supermarket in Europe.
It’s worth noting Spain’s food delivery rival, Glovo, has an existing grocery-delivery partnership with the French supermarket giant in markets including its home country — which likely explains why Uber Eats has opted for a different partner in Spain.
Asked whether it’s looking to further expand grocery deliveries in other markets hit by the public health emergency Uber Eats told us it’s exploring opportunities to partner with more supermarkets, convenience stores and other retailers around the world.
As part of its response to the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has switched all deliveries to contactless by default — with orders left at the door or as instructed by a user.
It also told us it’s providing drivers and delivery people with access to hand sanitiser, gloves and disinfectant wipes, as soon as they become available. And said it’s dispensing guidance to users of its apps on hygiene best practice and limiting the spread of the virus.
Uber Eats has previously said it will provide 14 days of financial support for drivers and delivery people who get diagnosed with COVID-19 or are personally placed in quarantine by a public health authority due to their risk of spreading the virus, with the amount based on their average earnings over the last six months or less.
The policy is due for review on April 6."

Wheels is not the first micromobility startup to pause operations during this pandemic. Yesterday, Lime paused its operations in a handful of markets, citing concerns about the coronavirus. Spin, on the other hand, has decided to keep operating because it sees its vehicles as a way to help people run their essential errands during San Francisco’s shelter-in-place order.
Wheels landed on its decision after coming to terms with the fact that while many riders said they prefer Wheels over public transportation or ride-sharing, it was important to protect its field team and “do everything we can to limit the spread of the virus,” the company said. Additionally, Wheels said it was concerned some riders weren’t using the vehicles for essential purposes.
At the end of the month, Wheels plans to revisit its decision and see what the next best steps are. In the meantime, Wheels will no longer be operating in  Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee, Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Scottsdale, Tempe, Stockholm, Madrid, and Basel."

The text, obtained by The Atlantic reads, Were writing to let you know that a positive case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was found at our facility today.
It may be the first of its kind in the facility, but it almost certainly wont be the last. Even as companies encourage workers to stay home at the first sign of sickness for both their benefit and that of customers, many will no doubt come to work. And then there’s the matter of those who are largely asymptomatic. 
Weve reached out to Amazon to commitment on the incident. The company noted in the text that workers at the DBK1 facility were sent home, while the sorting facility was disinfected. Amazon has denied reports that, while dayshift workers were sent home, those on the night shift were still expected to come in. 
In spite of the companys massive footprint, Amazon has been forced to limit certain shipments, including non-essentials through its Fulfillment by Amazon program, along with the temporary pausing of shipments from Prime Pantry."

For many parents with young children in the United States, shelter in place orders implemented in different areas over the past few weeks mean they now spend each day balancing work with taking care of their families. For child care providers, a vital but often underappreciated part of the American economy, the crisis means dealing with economic uncertainty, but also adapting to serve new roles, including providing care for essential workers.
Child care startups, including home-based daycare networks, apps for finding child care, and benefits and business management software, are working hard to help families. For example, many are using their technology to connect essential workers with carers or provide emergency child care, helping providers navigate government aid programs and, in some cases, raising their own relief funds.
TechCrunch talked to nine U.S.-based child care startups–home daycare and preschool networks Wonderschool, NeighborSchools, WeeCare and MyVillage; Winnie, Komae and Helpr, all apps for arranging child care; and enterprise software companies Kinside and Kangarootime–to see how they are dealing with the impact of COVID-19.
Child care for essential workers
Many of the child care startups TechCrunch spoke to are now focused on helping people in jobs classified as essential during shelter in place orders, including healthcare, emergency responders and grocery store workers. Several of them are adapting their platforms or services to serve those families more quickly, while balancing their urgent need for care with COVID-19 safety precautions.
For example, Winnie, a platform for finding verified child care providers throughout the United States, is collecting and updating data in real time about which providers are temporarily closed, and which ones have availability, says founder and CEO Sara Mauskopf. This week, Winnie launched a portal for parents to find emergency child care with immediate openings.
Kasey Edwards, the founder and CEO of Helpr, an app that connects parents with screened babysitters, said it is working with families of essential workers to help them afford child care. Helprs “Out-of-network” feature allows families to add their own care providers to the platform and manage backup care subsidies from their employers.
Meanwhile, Komae, an app that enables groups of families to create babysitting cooperatives and swap care with one another, is offering free care credits and working with seven healthcare organizations to coordinate child care for their workers, said founder and CEO Erin Beck.
The babysitting circles on Komae are private, “which means families from one organization can insulate their caregiving strictly among themselves, getting the care they need without risking exposure to the community at large (like our grandparents or other traditional caregivers),” Beck said. The app currently recommends that users “buddy up” with just one or two other families for their care group.
In some places, small in-home care providers have been allowed to stay open, said Chris Bennett, the co-founder and CEO of Wonderschool, a network of home-based child care and preschools in states including California, New York and Texas.
“Repeatedly, we are seeing county officials allowing small in-home childcare operators to continue to operate, thus providing support for these critical workers under shelter in place orders,” he said. “Our programs have now entered into a critical support role that larger preschools cannot support at this time.”
Jessica Chang, the co-founder and CEO of WeeCare, another network of in-home child care providers, said the company is “adjusting its support each hour and taking into account the changing protocols in each county. In certain areas such as Northern California and New York City, our providers are changing how they support their community. Instead of caring for children who attend their daycare regularly, they are now caring for children of first responders and essential workers.”
In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker ordered all early child care centers closed starting on March 23. The only centers currently allowed to operate in the state are Exempt Emergency Child Care programs, intended for essential workers and opened by the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC).
As a result, Boston-based NeighborSchools, which partners with home child care providers, closed all its centers to comply with the order. Co-founder and CEO Brian Swartz said some of NeighborSchools provider partners are applying to provide emergency child care for medical professionals, first responders and vulnerable populations. The startup is currently helping providers figure out regulatory requirements and putting together guidance for using government aid. It is also communicating with the EECs leadership to offer full access to its platform.
“While we never envisioned this scenario, the tech weve built for our network is uniquely well suited to automatically match families to child care programs in real-time,” said Swartz. “In child care scheduling, we need to account for each childs date of birth, the familys care schedule and the licensed capacity of each program within age range. Our team is ready to drop everything and make this happen if the EEC asks for our help.”
On-demand services
Startups are also helping other parents find short-term or emergency child care. Some have launched online services, like digital playdates, to help families balance working from home and their family lives.
MyVillage, a network of home-based care providers in Colorado and Montana, is seeing “an influx of interest from families who are looking for temporary care and/or short-term placement due to large child care centers closing and school districts closing,” said co-founder and CEO Erica Mackey. The company is currently working on a short-term placement solution for families in select MyVillage programs who need child care.
To help parents navigate the sudden collision of their work and home lives, Komae and Helpr both started offering online services. Helpr launched online music lessons and tutoring for families on its platform, while Komae is facilitating digital playdates. This means parents use the app to schedule video calls with their childrens friends.
“I never imagined my toddler could be so entertained by her friends on a computer screen, but they amazingly go an hour showing each other their toys and silly faces,” said Beck. “That social connection, for all of us, is so essential.”
Safety and support
Child washing hands
Safety compliance is always a priority for child care providers, but it is especially critical during this time. In addition to following CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, many companies have also enacted safeguards of their own. Some are also implementing financial support programs to help care providers who are forced to close because of illness.
For example, Beck published a letter on Komaes site on March 12, hours before Ohio became the first state to close schools, asking families on the app to immediately stop swapping child care.
“It was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make as a founder, because as a parent myself, I was painfully aware of how desperate these families would be for both care and companionship,” Beck said. “But adhering to social distance was not a given then like it is now; we had the responsibility as a leader of this vast community to be firm with what needed to be done.”
Taking steps like helping parents who work with healthcare organizations find care and launching digital features has allowed Komae to maintain its community, she added. “We knew Komae had the tools to make that happen, so with social distance at our core, we adapted for insulating or digital caresharing.”
As a safety precaution, WeeCare developed a feature to monitor caregivers for fevers, using a function already in its app that allows them to take photos and videos of children throughout the day and tag activities. The technology was adapted so providers can submit a video of themselves taking their temperature with a thermometer each morning. Once the video is verified by the WeeCare team, the provider receives a badge on their listing that says “Health Status: Fever-Free,” with the date of the verified reading.
Chang says the feature “allows providers to take more proactive measures, as recommended by the CDC, to ensure the health and safety of our community.”
Several companies are also providing financial programs to help their providers who are forced to shut down and ensure they dont feel compelled to work even when sick. For example, MyVillage raised additional funding to allow the 60-plus open programs in its network to continue earning their projected income into April. Mackey says that so far, two anonymous funders have contributed.
“Many of our educators dont have the safety net needed to stop working, so we want to help them stay open so long as its safe,” says Mackey. “If parents are exposed or infected and subject to quarantine, our relief funding provides a subsidy to cover 11 of the 14 days of the childs tuition until he or she can safely return to class.”
Helpr launched a paid sick leave policy for babysitters on its platform after the first known cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Sitters are also informed of any sickness in a home through a mandatory disclosure from the family in Helprs app when they book an appointment.
A few days after TechCrunch spoke to Wonderschool, Bennett announced that the company had been forced to lay off team members because of the crisis. Before the announcement, Bennett told TechCrunch that if a Wonderschool care program is forced to shut down because a child, parent or provider shows symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19, the company will draw on its network to help its other families find another carer in their area. For financial support, Wonderschool is monitoring state and federal relief policies for businesses.
“These crisis funds will be key in ensuring that in-home providers who have shut down temporarily are available to parents again once people return to work,” he said.
Enterprise software
For startups that build enterprise and management software related to child care, the pandemic creates a different set of challenges.
Genevieve Carbone of Kangarootime, business management software for child care providers, said that many of its customers have been relying on its messaging feature to keep families updated on rapidly changing regulations. Its software also enables “low contact,” for example by allowing information to be passed to parents digitally instead of on paper handouts, in-app check-in and check-outs, and online payments.
“Were keeping a very close eye on the impact the virus will have on businesses further down the road and how we can better support our customers once the pandemic passes,” said Carbone. “Improving billing for agencies/subsidies is something we have explored, assuming there may be an increase in families that will need government subsidies to cover their childcare.”
Kinside, whose software helps employees manage family care benefits and find daycares, has seen a 60% decline in incoming parents because of shelter at home mandates and social distancing, said co-founder and CEO Shadiah Sigala. Thousands of daycares in its network have also shut down.
Even places that are not currently under shelter in place orders have seen a drop in parents searching for immediate care because they know “its likely only a matter of time before all states invoke similar measures,” she added.
But Kinside is helping essential workers find childcare and has also recently begun working with human resources at hospitals and grocery chains on its platform to “offer white glove child care support to their employees.”
After the pandemic
Daycare and school shutdowns have forced families to change their routines under extraordinary and difficult circumstances, and the situation is highlighting the value of caregivers to the economy and the well-being of families. At the same time, it also underscores how vulnerable many providers are, with few safety nets.
Mackey says that MyVillage was created to address structural problems in child care that have existed for a long time “It was tough to make it as a child care provider before this pandemic, and now, its even harder. More than 40% of family home child care businesses nationally report that they couldnt make it two weeks without revenue from having children in care,” she said, adding that MyVillage was created to help fix “Americas deeply broken child care market, which doesnt work well for educators, who earn on average $11.50 an hour, or for working parents, who pay more than public university tuition for child care in a majority of states.”
Sigala said “the pandemic has exposed the essentiality of child care in the everyday working lives of Americans, and the overall economy. More of our jobs may be fit to support work from home. But they are certainly not fit for work from home with kids.”
After the pandemic is over, many parents may find it difficult to re-enroll their kids with the same care provider or need to find new options that are more financially manageable for them, she added. Kinside currently works with thousands of employers, as well as daycare centers that can add up to one million child care slots. The company plans to offer deep discounts or free access to Kinside to companies while they recover from the crisis.
“We predict company executives will return to running their companies with more empathy than ever,” said Sigala. “They, too just experienced the complete lack of child care infrastructure (perhaps for the first time); a problem that many of their employees face on a daily basis. We are ready to engage with heads of HR and key executives with resources and consulting gratis.”"

During the first three weeks of March, more than 30,000 new creators launched on the site — a much larger number than usual. These creators are also acquiring patrons faster than ever and they’re expanding their earnings at a quicker pace, as a result.
Creators around the world are being affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, often indirectly. To cut down on the spread of the novel coronavirus, live shows are being canceled and conferences and other events are being postponed. Other revenue streams creators may have previously relied on may be drying up, as well.
Many of these impacted creators have joined the Patreon platform in recent days to help with lost revenue and their fans have quickly followed.
According to Patreon’s internal metrics, average new patron growth across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, Australia, and Italy is up 36.2% in March compared to February.
In particular, Patreon saw a shift in patron behavior and creator additions starting on Friday, March 13th.
Since then, creators have been joining the platform at a faster rate than at any other point in the company’s history.
In addition, the proportion of creators who acquire their first patron within 10 days of launching has also increased. This is one of the strongest influxes of memberships Patreon has seen, the company said.
Today, Patreon’s platform serves over 150,000 total artists worldwide who generate income by offering exclusive content and communities to a network of over 4 million patrons across 180 countries. To date, creators have earned over $1 billion through the Patreon platform.
However, it’s not all good news. Patreon also notes it’s seeing slightly higher patron deletions as some members are choosing to exit the site due to financial hardships related to the COVID-19 crisis. But overall churn rates are stable for now, Patreon says, and the deletions are not at a rate other businesses are seeing.
Patreon isn’t the only platform seeing significant growth due to the societal impacts of COVID-19.
Fundraising sites like GoFundMe have also seen increases in recent weeks as people ask for assistance with living expenses, food and other basics, small business support, healthcare expenses and more.
More than 22K coronavirus related fundraisers have been created on our platform in the past several weekscollectively raising over $40M to support hospitals, local businesses, &amp; organizations helping on the frontlines around the world.

GoFundMe recently said that over 22,000 coronavirus-related fundraisers were created on its platform over the past few weeks, collectively raising over $40 million to support hospitals, businesses, and other organizations. The company said it would commit $1.5 million to support communities impacted by the pandemic, as well."

This includes suspending any launch campaigns currently on the calendar in the immediate future, like the Vega rocket mission carrying multiple satellites set for March 24 and the Soyuz rocket Falcon Eye mission set for April 14.
Arianespace says that the “need to fully implement the measures decided by the French Government” is the primary reason behind its decision to suspend launch campaign operations. The company also says that it is taking this action in order “to protect the health of employees and the local population, while also maintaining the security needed to prepare for scheduled launches.”
In order to facilitate the shut down and make sure that things are ready to go whenever conditions allow things to resume safely, the French space agency is working with Arianespace and all the companies involved on both the launch vehicle and payload side to secure the spacecraft and cargo in ‘standby’ mode. There’s no information on when things might resume, but that’s understandable given the circumstances.
Launch activities from other international space agencies and launch providers don’t appear to be specifically impacted yet SpaceX attempted a launch on Sunday, which was aborted for technical reasons, but that could be rescheduled for as early as mid-week. Meanwhile, a Chinese Long March rocket looks to be readying for take-off today, and ULA still seems to be tracking towards a March 26 launch of a Space Force communications satellite."

Contract tracing has already seemingly proven effective in some parts of the world that have managed to curb the coronavirus spread, but privacy advocates have big reservations about any such system’s implementation in the U.S.
There are a number of proposals of how to implement a contact tracing system that preserves privacy, including a decentralization proposal for a group of European experts. In the U.S., MIT researchers have devised a new method to would provide automated contact tracing that taps into the Bluetooth signals sent out by everyone’s mobile devices, tying contacts to random numbers that aren’t linked to an individual’s identity in any way.
The system works by having each mobile device constantly be sending out random strings of numbers that the the researchers liken to “chirps” (though not actually audible). These are sent via Bluetooth, which is key for a couple of reasons, including that most people have Bluetooth enabled on their device all the time, and that it’s a short-range radio communication protocol that ensures any reception of a “chirp” came from someone you were in relatively close contact to.
If any person tests positive for COVID-19, they can then upload a full list of the chirps that their phone has broadcast over the past 14 days (which at the outside, should represent the full time they’ve been contagious). Those go into a database of chirps associated with confirmed positive cases, which others can scan against to see if their phone has received one of those chirps during that time. A positive match with one of those indicates that an individual could be at risk, since they were at least within 40 feet or so of a person who has the virus, and it’s a good indicator that they should seek a test if available, or at least self-quarantine for the recommended two-week period.
MIT’s system sidesteps entirely many of the thorniest privacy-related issues around contact tracing, which have been discussed in detail by the ACLU and other privacy protection organizations: It doesn’t use any geolocation information at all, nor does it connect any diagnosis or other information to a particular individual. It’s still not entirely left to individual discretion, which would be a risk from the perspective of ensuring compliance, because MIT envisions a health official providing a QR code along with delivering any positive diagnosis that would trigger the upload of a person’s chirp history to the database.
The system would work through an app they install on their phone, and its design was inspired by Apple’s “Find My” system for locating lost Mac and IOS hardware, as well as keeping track of the location of devices owned by loved ones. Find My also uses chirps to broadcast locations to passing Apple hardware.
Find My inspired this system,” ays Marc Zissman, the associate head of MIT Lincoln Laboratorys Cyber Security and Information Science Division and co-principal investigator of the project in a blog post describing the research. “If my phone is lost, it can start broadcasting a Bluetooth signal thats just a random number; its like being in the middle of the ocean and waving a light. If someone walks by with Bluetooth enabled, their phone doesnt know anything about me; it will just tell Apple, Hey, I saw this light.
The system could be adapted to automate check-ins against the positive chirp database, and provide alerts to individuals who should get tested or self-isolate. Researchers worked closely with public health officials to ensure that this will suit their needs and goals as well as preserving privacy.
MIT’s team says that a critical next step to making this actually work broadly is to get Apple, Google and Microsoft on board with the plan. This requires close collaboration with mobile device platform operators to work effectively, they note. Extrapolating a step further, were iOS and Android to offer these as built-in features, that would go a long way towards encouraging widespread adoption."

Walmart Grocery, as a result, has now hit an all-time high in downloads — grabbing the No. 1 ranking position across all Shopping apps in the U.S. on April 5, 2020, and surpassing Amazon by 20%, according to a new analysis from app intelligence firm App Annie.
The Walmart Grocery application retained that No. 1 position for at least two days, the firm said, citing data from both the Google Play store and the Apple App Store, combined. While App Annie’s data was calculated on April 7, 2020, Walmart Grocery today is still No. 1 on Google Play as of today, April 9. It’s also now No. 2 on the App Store.
The surge of interest in Walmart Grocery may complicate Walmart’s plans to wind down the standalone app to instead merge Walmart Grocery into the retailer’s flagship mobile application and website. Earlier in March — before government lockdowns and home quarantines were widespread — Walmart announced a new strategy that would make its online grocery shopping service a part of the overall Walmart.com website and Walmart mobile app (the blue one).
The goal was to eventually wind down the separate Walmart Grocery experience entirely after customers had made the shift.
There are multiple benefits to this plan, including the ability to direct marketing dollars into only promoting one Walmart app, instead of two. It could also help drive sales across departments, as grocery shoppers may choose to buy other in-store items and Walmart shoppers may discover the grocery option while browsing the site for something else. In addition, Walmart Grocery’s millions of customers would be shifted to the main app, boosting its ranking on the app stores.
However, the COVID-19 health crisis has changed things quite a bit. As of April 5, 2020, the Walmart Grocery app saw a 460% growth in average daily downloads, in comparison with its January 2020 performance. That indicates a surge of brand-new customers to Walmart Grocery who may have never before placed an online grocery order.
Walmart Grocery isn’t the only Shopping app surging due to increased demand amid COVID-19.
An earlier report from Apptopia in March saw Walmart Grocery, Instacart and Shipt climbing the charts.
Overall, demand for retail delivery is now booming with Shopping app global downloads hitting 106 million during the week of March 29 and April 4, 2020, App Annie says — that’s up 15% from the weekly average in January 2020. Downloads in the U.S. alone were 14.4 million — up 20% from the same period. While Walmart Grocery’s jump was much larger (460%), Amazon also saw 20% growth in average daily downloads from January.
Even Walmart’s internal, employee-facing app is growing, App Annie found. The Me@Walmart app for associates using the Walmart scheduling system grew 220% on Android phones during the week of March 22 compared to 4 weeks prior. That reflects the increased demand for in-store workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Walmart had said in March it planned to hire 150,000 new employees in both its stores and fulfillment centers to help it meet the increased demand for e-commerce orders and deliveries. Since the March announcement, Walmart said it has hired around 5,000 new employees per day and may even surpass the original 150,000 figure. While Walmart’s intention was to hire these workers on a more temporary basis, it may find that things don’t revert to “normal” any time soon. Newcomers to online grocery may discover it’s an easier and now less riskier way to shop, and will continue to do so even when lockdowns are lifted."

The new addition is a timely one: CDL Recovery, which is designed to help turn science and research work into scalable products and services to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of both its effects on public health and on the economy.
CDL’s model for helping startups move from concept to product is fairly unique, and potentially uniquely well-suited to addressing new needs that emerge as a result of how the world is changing in response to the novel coronavirus. Many of the efforts to address needs both in terms of therapeutics, and in medical hardware to help shore up shortages are originating at schools and universities around the world, and CDL’s expertise heavily favors moving deep tech and hard science from inside the research lab to the market.
The program will be aimed at helping usher innovations from innovation to product in key areas including around diagnostic testing, vaccine development, remote care and telemedicine, as well as in areas of economics support like virtual work, talent re-training, remote equipment operation, automation and food production and supply. CDL founder and University of Toronto Professor Ajay Agrawal said in a blog post about the new program that many have suggested there’s a need “to assume a wartime footing in response to COVID-19,” and that’s one of the aims of the program.
It’s definitely true that crises like the one we face currently have a way of decreasing the turn around time from research, to development and deployment. And already, CDL’s program is designed from the ground-up to try to accelerate the pace at which that happens, working with academic institutions around the world including the University of Oxford, HEC Paris, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of British Columbia, HEC Montreal, the University of Calgary and Dalhousie University, as well as the University of Toronto. Teams who are approved to join take part in a series of sessions that set objectives, and then measure their progress, guided by mentors including the founders and executives of world-leading companies and institutions.
The CDL Recovery program will follow the same structure as its standard streams, but will be done at twice the pace in order to expedite the results. Applications are open now, and the program is available at no cost, and without any equity taken by any of the program operators."

I’m your host Kirsten Korosec, senior transportation reporter at TechCrunch. If this is your first time, hello; I’m glad you’re with us.
I have started to publish a version of the newsletter on TechCrunch. Thats what youre reading now. For the whole newsletter, which comes out every weekend, you can subscribe to the newsletter by heading over here, and clicking The Station. Its free!
Last week, I asked readers to share how they were doing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The response was overwhelming. It wasn’t just the number of you who reached out. It was your words devoid of pretense, the veneer exposed that struck me.
There were, of course, those who used the opportunity to make a marketing push or pitch a story. I get the impulse, but you won’t be rewarded here. I’m seeking something different. And I will share below some of what you sent me in hopes that it provides insight, solace, or dare I suggest, an esprit de corps among us.
I will repeat my appeal from last week: Maybe you’re a startup founder, a safety driver at an autonomous vehicle developer, a venture capitalist, engineer or gig economy worker. I’m interested in how you’re doing, what you’re doing to cope and how you’re getting around in your respective cities.
Please reach out and email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, opinions or tips or send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec.
Micromobbin’
As we’ve seen the past few weeks, operators are stepping up to respond and adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lyft began offering its scooters for free to healthcare and other essential workers. As part of the program, up to 30-minute rides will be free for members of critical workforces through April 30 in Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, the Washington D.C. metro area, San Diego and Santa Monica.
Spin, similarly, introduced a new initiative that provides free, 30-minute rides and helmets to essential healthcare workers. Spin, which began offering this on April 1, is making this available in Baltimore, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington, D.C.
‘Micromobility winter on steroids’
That’s how RideReport CEO William Henderson described the current state of the micromobility industry in a recent interview with TechCrunch reporter Megan Rose Dickey.Ride Report creates software that enables cities to work with micromobility operators. That gives Henderson a birds-eye view on the industry, which he shared with TechCrunch.
Yep, this is an Extra Crunch article, and you need a subscription. A few of the highlights include biking as one of the few bright spots, how some companies have pivoted to providing rides to healthcare workers and insights on how the industry and cities might have reacted had the pandemic occurred two years in the future.
A novel rewards program
These times have sparked a host of new ideas. Here’s one. A Nashville-based startup called Hytch Rewards developed an app that companies and governments can use to give their employees incentives to walk, bike, ride share or use public transit. The company’s entire purpose has been to reward commuter behavior that reduces traffic congestion and lowers emissions.
Now it’s pivoting to reward people for staying at home. The office of Tennessee Congressman Jim Cooper is among the first employer to partner on Hytch’s Shelter in Place initiative, which offers a small daily reward to staff for working from home.

Deal of the week
This week, we’ll highlight Via’s Series E funding round that was led by Exor. The on-demand shuttle startup raised $400 million, TechCrunch learned. Exor contributed $200 million of that raise. The remaining $200 million came from new investors Macquarie Capital, Mori Building and Shell as well as existing investors 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures,  Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.
Noam Ohana, who heads up Exor Seeds, the holding companys early-stage investment arm, will join Vias board.
Via gets the ‘deal of the week’ designation not just because its post-funding valuation is now $2.25 billion. Via’s actions during the pandemic offers a little bit of understanding on how companies are adapting and where opportunities may lie. Via has two sides of its business: a consumer-facing shuttle and a “partnerships” division that sells its software platform to cities and transit authorities that allow them to deploy their own shuttles.
As you might expect the consumer-facing shuttles has been adversely affected by COVID-19. There is some promise with the partnerships side of the business, according to CEO Daniel Ramot .
Existing partners, a list that includes transit authorities in Berlin, Germany, Ohio and Malta, have worked with Via to convert or adapt the software to meet new needs during the pandemic. A city might dedicate its shuttle service to transporting goods or essential personnel. For instance, Berlin converted its 120-shuttle fleet transport to an overnight service that provides free transit to healthcare workers traveling to and from work.
There has been a real interest in emergency services,” Ramot told me, adding he expects to see more demand for the software platform and the flexibility it provides as the pandemic unfolds.
Via isn’t the only company shifting its attention to emergency services. Moovit, an Israeli-based Mobility as a Service startup launched an Emergency Mobilization On-Demand service. The feature was developed to turn unused vehicle fleets into an on-demand solution to get essential workers to their destination. Moovit is also offering transit agencies and operators a transit data manager for free for three months. This management tool lets transit agencies communicate schedule, line changes, and service alerts to users.
Other deals:

The company said T. J. Rodgers and York Capital participated as well as an unnamed “major new strategic investor.”</li></ul>Layoffs in a time of COVID-19
We’ve all seen the bars, restaurants, retail shops and salons in our community shuttered because of stay-at-home directives from local and state governments. We’ve started to see the results of those closures in the form of tens of thousands of jobless claims.
Startups are not immune. It is difficult to get an exact number, but Layoffs.fyi is working to track what is going on in the startup world. As of April 4, the site had calculated 126 startups had laid off more than 10,000 people since March 11.
The transportation sector has been among those hardest hit. Some of the companies that have laid off 20% or more of their staff include shared scooter company Bird, peer-to-peer car rental  startups Getaround and Turo, Cabin, freight brokerage KeepTruckin, Moovel and Zipcar.
Maybe your company is actually hiring. If so, go check out Layoffs.fyi, the site doesn’t just list layoffs. The site also includes spreadsheet that list employees who you might want to hire.
From you
I have selected a few excerpts from readers who shared with me and now you all their observations about the what is happening in their lives in this COVID-19 world. I have edited these for length and clarity.
I plan to share more with you in the weeks ahead, so please reach out.
From Canoo CPO James Cox, who also advises founders of Routable.ai, a startup that developed a real-time routing engine for high-capacity rides. Cox explained in his email to me that Routable’s CEO wrote a piece in Medium (which you can read here) about providing critical transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result of the piece, the Boston Medical Center reached out last week. They’ve now adapted their technology to provide rides to homeless people and solve an allocation problem of which bed in which hospital in Boston to send them to.
They’ve worked directly with the frontline doctors and nurses and IT teams on it. They were previously using a whiteboard, which is obviously not going to scale to solve the problem! The trial launches Monday and is a really interesting short-term pivot that is solely focussed on doing good and adjusting to this crazy world we are now living in.
From Aryan Bhasin, a college student under lockdown in India:
There is no sense of transportation at all. Public transport is becoming interesting because even though all forms of transport are banned (one can only use a vehicle to buy essentials at grocery stores), the Indian government has been sending hoards of buses to get villagers back to their villages completely blowing apart all rules of social distancing.
Airlines, too, have been a very interesting sector to follow. Most airlines have changed their business models significantly in lieu of COVID-19 as governments organize airlifts for stranded citizens.
From Luis Orsini-Rosenberg, CEO of GetHenry, a Berlin-based micromobility startup that focuses on B2B services. GetHenry, which is part of the Techstars Smart Mobility Accelerator, operates in Austria, Germany and Spain. He shared what is happening in Austria.
All of our business partners in Austria had to close its gates. A day after the lockdown was communicated by the government, we started to reach out to hundreds of restaurants, deliveries, couriers, hospitals, pharmacies and medical services to offer them our vehicles for individual transportation or last-mile delivery cases. Last week, the first e-scooters went out to restaurant partners and medical services.
We are starting to generate some revenues again, but it will not be enough to keep the business alive long-term. We have applied for public aid funds and wage subsidies and will cut costs to an absolute minimum in the coming weeks. Going forward, we will either: wait and do nothing or solely focus on the last-mile delivery service."

The stock market is, of course, not the economy. And this is likely a dead cat bounce a temporary recovery after a big fall. The question is how many dead cat bounces will we see in the coming weeks?
And while the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing that didn’t stop investors from grasping at data from John Hopkins University that suggests the number of new COVID-19 cases is slowing. The institution’s coronavirus map, which has become a go-to source, showed 25,200 new cases rising on March 31, then rising to 33,300 new cases by April 3. Those numbers dropped to 28,200 new cases April 4, per its data; other trackers have posted slightly different results.
Today’s rally will be tested in the days and weeks to come as COVID-19 cases continue and eventually hit a peak before plateauing. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has warned that cases, and deaths, will likely surge in the next week.
Here are the days results:
<ul><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 7.59%, or 1,597.21 points, to close at 22.649.74</li><li>S&amp;P 500: rose 6.95%, or 172.86 points, to close at 2,661.51</li><li>Nasdaq composite: popped 7.33%, or 540.15 points, to close at 7,913.24</li></ul>There were other indirect COVID-19 fundamentals such as new sales guidance or analyst notes that also moved certain stocks.
E-commerce stocks, including eBay and Amazon saw positive movement. Online retailer Wayfair was perhaps the biggest mover in this category. The company’s shares opened 36% higher after reporting its gross revenue growth rate more than doubled at the end of March. Wayfair shares closed up 41.7% to $71.50.
Music streaming company Spotify saw shares decline more than 4% after Raymond James downgraded the stock from “strong buy” to “market perform,” citing that COVID-19 was causing less engagement and fewer downloads as users spend more time indoors. Spotify shares did manage to bounce back during the day and ended up closing up nearly 0.33% to $122.52.
Shares of SaaS companies rallied on the day as well, with the Bessemer cloud index rising 6.79% on the day; shares of SaaS companies, modern software firms, have enjoyed strong revenue multiples in recent years. They have tracked the broader indices down, however, and remain in bear-market territory.
Looking ahead, we’re entering earnings season during a period of intense economic uncertainty; how the stock market performs in the future will at least partially depend on how companies performed in Q1 2020, and what they project for the future. Get ready."

The data is collected as a set of “Mobility Trends Reports,” which are updated daily and which provide a look at the change in the number of routing requests made within the Maps app, which is the default routing app on iPhones, for three modes of transportation including driving, walking and transit.
Apple is quick to note that this information isn’t tied to any individuals, since Maps does not associate any mobility data with a user’s Apple ID, nor does it maintain any history of where people have been. In fact, Apple notes that all data collected by maps, including search terms and specific routing, is only ever tied to random rotating identifying numbers that are reset on a rolling basis. This anonymized, aggregated data is collected only to provide a city, country or region-level view, representing the change over time in the number of pedestrians, drivers and transit-takers in an area based on the number of times they open the app and ask for directions.
As far as signals go for measuring the decrease in outdoor activity in a given city, this is a pretty good one considering Apple’s install base and the fact that most users probably don’t bother installing or using a third-party app like Google Maps for their daily commuting or transportation needs.
The data is available to all directly from Apple’s website, and can be downloaded in a broadly compatible CSV format. You can also use the web-based version to search a particular location and see the overall trend for that area.
For an individual, this is more or less a curiosity, but the release f this info could be very useful for municipal, state and federal policy makers looking to study the impact of COVID-19, as well as the effect of strategies put in place to mitigate its spread, including social distancing, shelter-in-place and quarantining measures.
Apple has also announced that it’s working with Google on a new system-level, anonymized contact tracing system that both companies will first release as APIs for use by developers, before making them native built-in features that are supplemented by public health agency applications and guidance. Apple seems particularly eager to do what it can to assist with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, while still striving to ensure that these measures respect the privacy of their individual users. That’s a hard balance to strike in terms of taking effective action at a population level, but Apple’s reach is a powerful potential advantage to any tools it provides."

Regardless of which side you’re on, it remains true that further testing is needed, and startup Scanwell has begun a sizeable study for its at-home antibody test, while it continues to work with the FDA on emergency use authorization for the diagnostic.
Scanwell is working with the state of North Carolina and Raleigh-based Wake Forest Baptist Health to distribute 1,000 of its at-home antibody test kits to a random sampling of citizens, funded in part by $100,000 from the state legislature. The sample population, chosen from the patient pool of Wake Forest Baptist Health’s system, and meant to be a statistically representative snapshot of the larger population, will get a finger-prick blood sample collection kit by mail, every month for a full year, in order to hopefully track the virus and immunity over time.
The Scanwell test can only be used for research purposes at this time, since it hasn’t yet received an emergency use authorization by the FDA. The FDA has so far specifically not authorized any at-home tests for COVID-19, including those supported by telemedicine, but it has recently updated its guidance to note that it “sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection,” and it says it is in the process of actively pursuing the development of tests that fit that profile in partnership with diagnostic companies.
LA-based Scanwell Health, which already provides at-home diagnostics for detecting UTIs, announced its work on securing FDA authorization for use of its at-home serological antibody test last month. The test kits can provide results in as little as 15 minutes once they’re received by diagnostic labs, but questions have been raised about the general accuracy of antibody testing overall regarding COVID-19, and there’s still some debate about the nature and duration of post-infection immunity for people who have contracted and recovered from the virus.
Better understanding immunity and who has recovered are key ingredients in any attempt to gradually relax isolation restrictions, so immunity testing is a core component that. It’s something that will be needed at scale, along with infection testing through existing molecular testing methods, and contact tracing, like the system being put in place through Apple and Google."

With government lockdowns keeping people from being able to visit friends and other loved ones in person, consumer demand for video chat apps has skyrocketed. This has resulted in the video conferencing category of apps hitting record numbers in March, app store intelligence firm App Annie recently reported. Until now, however, Houseparty had remained quiet about its own metrics.
Today, that changed, as Houseparty revealed that in the past month, its app has seen 50 million sign-ups — a figure that’s around 70 times above normal.
According to data from Apptopia, Houseparty has seen record mobile downloads, as well, with installs spiking in recent weeks. During the past 30 days, Houseparty has seen 17.2 million new installs across iOS and Android, by its estimates.
But the app is also available for Mac and Chrome, which aren’t included in that figure.
The increased consumer demand has also seen the app topping the mobile app stores’ charts in a number of markets, the company said.
Houseparty became the No. 1 Social app in 82 countries, including the U.S. App Store. It was also No. 3 Social app on the U.S. Google Play store.
The app grew to become the No. 1 Overall app in 16 countries, as well. And in the U.S. App Store, it got as high as the No. 3 Overall app. On Google Play, it reached as high as No. 10.
The company said users have engaged with the app for long session times, with the average time in conversation per user remaining at over 60 minutes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these average times were sometimes even as high as 80+ minutes.
Houseparty has typically appealed to younger users than those on other video chat apps, as it’s designed for social hangouts. For starters, the app integrates with Snapchat. And like Snapchat, it also heavily relies on gesture-based navigation that older users tend to struggle with. Plus, it offers in-app games to play, like trivia or Ellen’s popular “Heads Up,” among others.
Meanwhile, video chat rivals — like Zoom, Skype and Google Hangouts — are often used by remote workers and in a corporate setting, in addition to their emerging consumer use cases. This tends to have the apps skew a bit older and distances them from the idea of being “fun.”
That being said, with the increases in usage tied to COVID-19, Houseparty claims people of all ages and backgrounds are now joining the app.
In addition, Houseparty’s users are connected to an average of 23 friends and nearly half of users having conversations are playing games — a figure the company had not previously revealed.  (The company recently made all its games free to play, which has likely impacted usage).
While the U.S. has always been Houseparty’s largest market, App Annie last month reported on Houseparty’s growth, noting it had seen particular demand in Europe. This included countries like Italy and Spain where installs during the week of March 21 surged at 423x and 2360x the average weekly number of installs in Q4 2019. What’s remarkable about the growth is that some of the countries, like Spain, were markets where Houseparty never had wide-scale penetration before the COVID-19 crisis.
Though Houseparty tends to keep its core metrics under wraps — like total users or revenue, for example — it likely released its new numbers today for a variety of reasons.
For one, Houseparty may just want to redirect focus from an odd situation where it was recently accused of a data breach by way of social media posts from users. Through tweets, users claimed their Houseparty user data was being used to access other accounts, like Netflix and Spotify. But Houseparty denied the breach and even suggested that the social media posts were a part of a “paid commercial campaign” aimed at harming its business. It offered a $1 million reward for any evidence that proved this theory. Nothing yet has come of that and some of the posts have since disappeared.
In addition, Houseparty rival Zoom was recently been criticized for a variety of security and privacy issues, which the CEO Eric Yuan has since apologized for and promised to fix. But in the meantime, Houseparty may hope to boost its install base further, by appealing to those who are now looking for a Zoom alternative. (Although Houseparty has its own privacy issues, it’s not been as widely reported).
Finally, there’s the fact that there aren’t that many times in a company’s life where it can detail its outsized growth like this. It’s unprecedented for there to be some 158 million Americans being told to stay at home, plus millions more worldwide, which creates an ideal climate for video chat apps to thrive."

People.ai, a predictive sales startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Iconic, Lightspeed and other investors and last year valued at around $500 million, has laid off around 30 people, working out to about 18% of staff, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.
Alongside that, the company has quietly raised a debt round in the “tens of millions of dollars” to make strategic investments in new products and potentially other moves.
Oleg Rogynskyy, the founder and CEO, said the layoffs were made not because business has slowed down, but to help the company shore up for whatever may lie ahead.
“We still have several years of runway with what we’ve raised,” he noted (it has raised just under $100 million in equity to date). “But no one knows the length of the downturn, so we wanted to make sure we could sustain the business through it.”
Specifically, the company is reducing its international footprint — now, big European customers that it already has on its books will now be handled from its US offices rather than local outposts — and it is narrowing its scope to focus more on the core verticals that make up the majority of its current customer base.
He gave as an example the financial sector. “We create huge value for financial services industry but have moved the functionality for them out to next year so that we can focus on our currently served industries,” he said.
People.ai’s software tracks the full scope of communication touch points between sales teams and customers, supposedly negating the tedious manual process of activity logging for SDRs. The company’s machine learning tech is also meant to generate the average best way to close a deal educating customer success teams about where salespeople may be deviating from a proven strategy.
People.ai is one of a number of well-funded tech startups that is making hard choices on business strategy, costs and staffing in the current climate.
Layoffs.fyi, which has been tallying those losing their jobs in the tech industry in the wake of the Coronavirus (it’s based primarily on public reports with a view to providing lists of people for hire), says that as of today, there have been nearly 25,000 people laid off from 258 tech startups and other companies. With companies like Opendoor laying off some 600 people earlier this week, the numbers are ratcheting up quickly: just seven days ago, the number was just over 16,000.
In that context, People.ai cutting 30 may be a smaller increment in the bigger picture (even if for the individuals impacted, it’s just as harsh of an outcome). But it also underscores one of the key business themes of the moment.
Some businesses are getting directly hit by the pandemic — for example, house sales and transportation have all but halted, leaving companies in those categories scrambling to figure out how to get through the coming weeks and months and prepare for a potentially long haul of life and consumer and business behaviour not looking like it did before January.
But other businesses like People.ai, which provides predictive sales tools to help salespeople do their jobs better, is (for now at least) falling into that category of IT is still in demand, perhaps even more than ever in a shrinking economy. In People.ai’s case, software to help salespeople have better sales conversations and ultimately conversions at a time when many customers might not be as quick to buy things, is an idea that sells right now (so to speak).
Rogynskyy noted that more than 90% of customers that are up for renewal this quarter have either renewed or expanded their contracts, and it has been adding on new large customers in recent weeks and months.
The company has also just closed a round of debt funding in the “tens of millions” of dollars to use for strategic investments. 
It’s not disclosing the lender right now, but it opted for debt in part because it still has most of its most recent round — $60 million raised in May 2019 led by Iconic — in the bank. Although investors would have been willing to invest in another equity round, given that the company is in a healthy position right now, Rogynskyy said he preferred the debt option to have the money without the dilution that equity rounds bring.
The money will be used for strategic purposes and considering how to develop the product in the current climate. For example, with most people now working from home, and that looking to be a new kind of “normal” in office life (if not all the time, at least more of the time), that presents a new opportunity to develop products tailored for these remote workers.
There have been some M&amp;A moves in tech in the last couple of weeks, and from what we understand People.ai has been approached as well as a possible buyer, target and partner. All of that for now is not something the company is considering, Rogynskyy said. “We’re focused on our own future growth and health and making sure we are here for a long time.”"

The company says that its tests have already been used by the City of Los Angeles since late March and have tested over 53,000 city residents.
Curative’s tests use an oral-fluid sample collected by having the subject cough to produce sputum, which release the virus from deep in the lungs, according to a spokesperson.
Here’s how the letter digitally signed by the FDA’s chief science officer, Denise Hinton, describes the Rucative test:
To use your product, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is first extracted, isolated and purified from oropharyngeal (throat) swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, and oral fluid specimens. The purified nucleic acid is then reverse transcribed into cDNA followed by PCR amplification and detection using an authorized real-time (RT) PCR instrument. The Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay uses all commercially sourced materials or other authorized materials and authorized ancillary reagents commonly used in clinical laboratories as described in the authorized procedures submitted as part of the EUA request. 
Curative, which was first covered by DotLA, is processing the tests in conjunction with Korva Labs, a testing facility associated with UCLA.
These tests hope to get around the supply chain shortages that constrain the number of tests the US can conduct. Currently, the US is still experiencing a shortage of test kits because the supply chain for critical components used in test kits has been disrupted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the company said.
Curative is working to build alternatives to many of the sample collection and extraction kit components and what it calls more scalable RNA extraction methods that don’t rely on the use of magnetic silica beads.
The company was initially founded in January 2020 to focus on a novel test for sepsis, but pivoted to focus on COVID-19 testing as the disease swept across the globe.
“Our goal is to assemble an orthogonal supply chain to supply coronavirus test kits. Doing so will help us avoid buying materials that would constrain public health and CDC laboratories from ramping up production,” the company said on its website. “We are also working to partner with other operations looking to spin up testing facilities to help them source necessary reagents.”
Curative says that its test is better for two reasons. Its sampling method reduces the risk of exposure for healthcare workers and requires less Personal Protective Equipment and its use of an alternative supply chain means it can scale tests rapidly.
The company can already process roughly 5,000 tests per day and is manufacturing 20,000 test kits over the same period. Test results can be delivered in around 31 hours.
Broad access to testing is critical to our nations response to COVID-19 and with this authorization, we can continue scaling and distributing our test nationwide, said Fred Turner, the chief executive and founder of Curative Inc. Our work with the Cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach has helped thousands of people access testing at drive-through facilities and we are fully equipped to expand that access to help thousands more across the country. At the same time, we are continuing to work with the FDA to validate our test for at-home collection, which would expand access even more.
With the new authorization, the company is going to begin working with additional distributors around the country.
The Curative tests are already used by Los Angeles, Long Beach and through testing organized by LA County and the LA County Fire and Sherrif’s Department. The tests aren’t being sold directly to consumers and must be ordered by a physician, the company said.
Backed by the venture firm DCVC, Curative has already been the subject of some controversy when its investor sent a letter to limited partners indicating they’d be able to get access to the Curative tests upon request.
The firm wrote:
“… please let us know as soon as possible if you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and are unable to get tested. Through a unique relationship with one of our portfolio companies, we will expedite delivery of a test kit (simple, fast, safe saliva/cheek swab) that should provide results within 1-3 days via return by mail.”
In a subsequent blog post, the partners at DCVC explained their outreach.
With changes in regulations enabling telemedicine across state lines, we wanted to make sure everyone DCVC knows was aware of Carbons excellent care and full suite of testing. And yes, that includes people who work at our Limited Partners, who are making difficult decisions for themselves and their families in difficult times like the rest of us.
With Carbon moving at the pace they do with their fast, friendly electronic on-boarding, and with Curatives testing capability likely ramping to 10,000+ tests a day in the next ten days, the combined health care firepower can indeed expedite care for everybody.
Was our language a little boastful? Yes, no excuses. And were sorry if folks got the wrong idea. No one is jumping in line. We will always strive to point out to our friends and community where they can get quick access to quality care as well as access to other cutting-edge technology in our portfolio.
Accurate testing remains the most important feature of any effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and a number of startup companies are working on novel diagnostics.
As Harvard University epidemiologist, William Hanage told Business Insider, “Figuring out what’s actually going on in the community is the key part of dealing with this pandemic.”"

The patient’s case was described as a “mild-to-moderate” case, and while she was hospitalized, she was only treated with intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and didn’t receive any other drugs, nor did she require being put on a ventilator. Accordingly, her case was one of the less severe that required hospitalization, providing an opportunity for scientists to study in detail her body’s mostly positive immune response to the novel coronavirus.
Researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity received the patient’s permission to participate in their research, along with a number of other subjects, and were able to collect blood samples that showed how her immune responses performed, and when they activated. The research showed that the patient started developing antibodies in the patient’s blood before her symptoms fully disappeared, and that they remained present at least seven days after the infection went away.
While this case alone won’t provide any definitive information without additional study and examination of other patients, it’s a promising step towards evaluating how healthcare professionals treating COVID-19 patients might be able to discover earlier which patients will end up with more severe symptoms, and which will develop milder cases. They could also inform the development of new medical interventions to ultimately reduce case severity, or help develop vaccines with maximum efficacy.
This research could also help us better understand how post-illness immunity works for COVID-19. With other coronaviruses, like the common cold and the flu, immunization is temporary, which is why we have a seasonal flu shot, for instance. We don’t yet know in great detail how immunity works for recovered COVID-19 patients, and this research could provide more insight into that."

The company announced that all person-to-person (P2P) transactions under 1000 Kenyan Schillings ( $10) would be free starting Tuesday for the next 90 days.
The move came after Safaricom met with the country’s Central Bank and per a directive from Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta “to explore ways of deepening mobile-money usage to reduce risk of spreading the virus through physical handling of cash,” according to a release provided to TechCrunch from Safaricom.
To encourage the use of digital-payments over cash, the East African telecom will also allow SMEs to increase their daily M-Pesa transaction limits from 70,000 Kenyan Schillings to 150,000 ( $700 to $1500).
The measures represent the ability of the Kenyan government to use digital-finance as a lever to influence social-distancing and P2P transactions in an infectious health crisis.
M-Pesa has 20.5 million customers across a network of 176,000 agents and generates around one-fourth ($531 million) of Safaricoms  $2.2 billion annual revenues (2018). The company has held nearly 75% of mobile-money market share in Kenya for nearly a decade and the country has the highest mobile-money usage rates in Africa.
In some respects, having all that output on one platform represents systemic risks to Kenya’s economy.  But in the case of a global health pandemic spread by human contact, the dominance of mobile-money in the country provides a policy-tool to encourage digital vs. physical contact on a wide scale through financial transactions.
Kenya has only three cases of COVID-19 (aka coronavirus), according to Worldometer, but the country is taking cautionary measures. President Uhuru cancelled two foreign meetings due to the virus, the University of Nairobi shut-down classes and a number of companies in the country are encouraging workers to telecommute, according to local sources and press reporting."

After a flurry of blog posts by Google and Verily over the weekend, as well as a follow-up press conference by the White House, it became clear that the screening and testing site was a Verily project, limited in scope to California residents, with a specific focus on a couple of counties for now.
That’s what launched on Monday morning (as eventually clarified by the White House) a site hosted at Verity’s Project Baseline, which until now has acted as a portal connecting potential participants with medical research studies. The California COVID-19 risk screening and testing site provides screening and potential free testing to those who are eligible based on its criteria, which right now includes residents of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County.
In addition to being located in these places, eligible participants must also be 18 or older; a resident of the U.S.; able to speak and read English; and willing to sign a COVID-19 Public Health authorization form, according to the website. This form provides permission to Verity to collect a person’s information to be used for the screening process. Anyone looking to make use of the site must also either create a new Google account or connect their existing account in order to register.
Despite the requirement of a Google account, Verily says on its website FAQ that it “follows federal and state regulations governing the collection and use of an individual’s data,” and stores the information securely in an encrypted format. It does note that Verily staff will have direct information to identifying information about anyone who uses the site, and that information will be shared with health care professionals, lab personnel, and health officials, and that info could potentially be shared with Verily’s data technology provider partners, including Google.
The company specifically says that it will not share any info with any insurance or medical providers without direct consent, and that any information shared through the COVID-19 screening process will not be used for advertising.
What the website actually provides participants is a multi-question survey that determines initial eligibility, followed by a more in-depth questionnaire intended to asses a person’s risk relative to actually having contracted coronavirus, which is then used to determine whether to direct them to a mobile testing site where they’ll receive a nasal swab and, after “a few days” according to Verily, their test results.
Verily said in a blog post over the weekend that it is working with California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office on expanding availability of the tool to additional parts of the Bay Area and the state. The company hasn’t so far mentioned explicitly any plans to expand to other states, and when I posed the question via email I received an auto-response directing me to their blog post citing a high volume of inbound requests."

Per the Commission, the funding does not have any particular thematic priorities attached to it but it said today it will look to “fast track the awarding of EIC grants and blended finance (combining grant and equity investment) to Coronavirus relevant innovations, as well as to facilitate access to other funding and investment sources”.
The deadline for this call for applications to the EIC Accelerator is 17:00 on March 18 CET.
The Commission has a page of tips for applicants here.
It notes EIC funding is already supporting a number of startups and SMEs with “Coronavirus relevant innovations” from funding awarded in previous rounds — pointing to the EpiShuttle project for specialised isolation units; the m-TAP project for filtration technology to remove viral material; and the MBENT project to track human mobility during epidemics.
The EIC is itself funded under the EU’s Horizon Europe research framework program.
Back in February the Commission said it expected to sign off on a significant increase for the EIC budget as of this month — to support “game-changing, market-creating innovation and deep-tech SMEs to scale-up”, as it works towards launching the next seven-year round of the Horizon Europe program, in 2021.
It also said there would be a one-off EIC Accelerator call for green deal start-ups and SMEs in May 2020 cut-off round, to align with its push to make the bloc carbon neutral by 2050."

Based on Nielsen data from prior major crises in recent U.S. history that forced consumers to stay home, total TV usage increased by nearly 60%. We’re not there yet, but consumption is starting to climb in the most impacted markets, the firm found.
For example, Nielsen saw a 22% increase in total TV usage in the Seattle/Tacoma metro last Wednesday, compared with a week ago. New York and L.A. are already seeing usage that’s up by 8% during the same time. And for some demographics, usage is much higher.
Seattle teens home from school notched a 104% increase over this period, Nielsen found.
Total TV usage, to be clear, includes watching traditional live TV, DVR recordings, video-on-demand, and streaming services or other content through any TV set, game console or connected device.
But there’s potential for TV usage to grow even further.
During a crisis, TV viewing booms as consumers ramp up media consumption to stay informed as well as to kill time.
Nielsen is not officially forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic will increase TV viewing to levels associated with historical crises. But it does note that U.S. consumers have traditionally turned to the TV during troubling times.
When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August 2017, for instance, Nielsen’s analysis found a 56% increase in total TV usage during the impacted period compared with the preceding period. And during the severe snowstorm that hit New York on the weekend of Jan. 23, 2016, total TV usage was 45% higher during the Saturday of the snow event compared with the Saturday before.
These, of course, were isolated events of a limited during. The COVID-19 crisis is different because it doesn’t just affect one region, nor will it be over within a few days or weeks’ time.
During these events, Nielsen said consumers stuck at home were tuning into feature films, news, and general programming.
Streaming, in particular, jumped by 61% during these periods.
The larger impact from COVID-19 could be from the newly remote U.S. workforce. Prior Nielsen data suggests that employees who work remotely Monday through Friday watch over three more hours per week of traditional TV, compared with non-remote workers, at 25 hours and 2 minutes vs. 21 hours and 56 minutes, respectively.
These changes to media consumption related to the COVID-19 crisis come at a time when the U.S. is already at a historical high for media consumption. Before the pandemic, U.S. consumers were already just shy of 12 hours each day with media platforms, and three-fourths of U.S. consumers are broadening their media options with streaming subscriptions and TV-connected devices.
Trends elsewhere in the world indicate COVID-19 will send users to stream even more.
In Italy and Spain, for example, first-time installs of Netflix’s app were up 57% and 34%, respectively, according to Sensor Tower data.
In addition, live streaming across YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and Mixer grew by over 66% in Italy between the first week of February and this past week, according to StreamElements, and viewers were watching nearly double the number of channels.
But brands looking to capitalize on the stuck-and-home audience may not find that their messages resonate or produce the actions they desire. That’s because brands are looking to increase sales for products and services, and many consumers won’t now risking leaving their home to spend."

The change means that people undertaking a test will be able to conduct their own swab, which will involve swabbing shallowly in their nose. The existing process required a healthcare professional to take the swab, and to collect a sample from further up in the nasal cavity. This change does not mean there’s any difference in the FDA’s guidance regarding at-home sample collection that is still specifically disallowed by the agency’s rules, something the FDA clarified over the weekend in order to put an end to at-home test collection kits being distributed by diagnostic startups.
Individuals will still have to go to authorized clinical or drive-through testing sites, and will still have to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s screening requirements in order to get tested in the first place. But Vice President Mike Pence said that this will mean that testing conditions are safer for frontline medical personnel, in addition to lowering the drain on PPE resources.
Pence also added that all state and private labs now required by law to report all of their results by law to the CDC, whereas previously, some states were reporting only positive results, which obviously skewered the data in terms of the number of people in the U.S. tested and the resulting positive diagnoses."

And according to Kari Sulenes, almost everybody who has built a company has a burnout story. Her startup, Atlas, connects venture firms and startup founders to specialized therapy sessions. Plus, it views the silver linings of burnout stories: Theres also a large number of people who have a burnout story who have an impact story that comes out of it. 
More recently, as a response to the coronavirus outbreak, the company was hired by a number of venture capital firms to provide mental health services to portfolio companies. The uptick in business — that is, clients looking to provide founder-specialized therapy during uncertain times — makes Atlas projected to double its estimated revenue this year.   
Weve interviewed VCs that, in the wake of the novel coronavirus disease, have told their startups to hold off putting excessive capital to work. Others said to keep your head down and work on the product. And some that say it is business as usual until the dry powder dries up. 
Beyond business economics, mental health remains largely unaddressed from the slew of issues that founders struggle with, oftentimes alone and in private. Atlas utilization sheds light on how the tech industrys financial arm is prioritizing health. 
Its just one data point, but its an important one, nonetheless.
Starting this week, Atlas is launching a small group founder program with the following firms: Primary VC, Corigin Ventures, SoGal Ventures, Spero Ventures, Lerer Hippeau and Crosscut Ventures. 
Atlas is also working with the venture capital firm it spun out from in the first place: AlphaBridge VC. Sulenes, the founder and executive director, noted that while these firms were in prior communication with Atlas, the outbreak helped increase their business with the company (in other words, the world ending inspired the firms to bring its mental health resources out to its portfolio founders).
Heres how small group sessions for founders will shape up: Atlas will hold a virtual group program that connects six to eight founders, mixed between all the portfolios of client venture firms with a minimum commitment of six months. Each small group will meet twice a month for one and a half hours, and it will be facilitated by a trained life coach. From there, Sulenes says, there is not much structure. 
Founders cant bring [anxiety] to their company, they have to hold steady and strong, she said. We are the place they can have their freak out that they cant have every other place.
The small groups will be created by a three-interview process led by Atlas. Sulenes noted that she matches groups based on stage of company, plus goals and personality structure so the people who want to go deep and talk about existential problems can. Others, she said, might want to keep it to business impact. 
Atlas anti-matches on sectors so there arent competitors in the same group. The company also has an offering in which it embeds a coach in a company to work with employees, executives and managers for mindfulness and development. 
Before the outbreak, Atlas relied simply on word of mouth. 
We are different from coaching firms who are charging a lot of money and looking to be seen as experts — we are who we serve, Sulenes said. There are no clinical psychologists within Atlas, but there are individuals who are trained to be life coaches.
Sulenes says that the team was thankfully at scale for massive interest with a group of trained coaches on deck. Right now, due to the pandemic, the startup is offering any founder a preliminary conversation, free of charge. 
Of course, the startup has had to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak in-house as well. While the meetup is usually done in person, Sulenes said that the small groups will be done virtually. Next week, theyre having a free event for group coaching — it is titled Homeostasis Happy Hour."

The …",http://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/postmates-reveals-plans-to-cover-medical-costs-for-couriers-as-part-of-covid-19-response/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-860314240.jpg?w=600,2020-03-10T17:36:52Z,"Postmates said that it will be creating a fund to cover the costs for doctor appointments and medical expenses related to the COVID-19 outbreak for its delivery fleet and for merchants, Postmates will waive commission fees for stores in impacted markets.
The goal, the company said, is to give small business owners access to on-demand delivery at no additional cost. Postmates said it would launch the initiatives this week.
As the company noted, over half of Americans are unable to afford a $400 unexpected expense, so the Postmates Fleet Relief Fund will allow its couriers to take proactive preventive health. The company said the new policy builds on steps it has already taken like issuing guidance from CDC to its fleet, and the creation of the new non-contact dropoff option inside the app.
Postmates couriers who have made at least one delivery in states where cases of COVID-19 have been identified will ben eligible for credits from the emergency relief fund, which can be deposited towards the Postmates health savings vehicle (which is powered by Starship), the company said.
Any Postmate courier who doesn’t have a health account but is interested in the emergency relief credit, can sign up for the health savings vehicle and become eligible for the stipend to cover expenses, irrespective of diagnosis or quarantine. Interested couriers can sign up on the company’s website.
The company is also waiving commission fees for companies that want to sign up with the service for a “pilot program”.
The pilot program is only for businesses that are not currently on the platform and are operating out of San Francisco.
Like other technology companies in the Bay area and beyond, the Postmates program is a mix of social good (and aligns with other big tech companies’ initiatives) and an attempt to grab additional customers and market share in the time of a crisis.
The company’s move is also a little less risky given that the government is weighing options to compensate hourly workers for health expenses related to the coronavirus and bailouts for small businesses impacted by the ways in which state and local governments attempt to mitigate the spread of th edisease.
Nationally, one in four private sector employees lack access to any sick leave at all. While our ongoing campaigns in California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois seek to modernize 20th century laws to fit 21st century work for independent workers, now is the time to put aside the politics of the gig economy and work with all stakeholders to develop creative and meaningful emergency support for frontline workers who may be exposed — its the right thing to do, said Vikrum Aiyer, Vice President of Public Policy for Postmates. We know that two thirds of the individuals that carry out deliveries through the Postmates app have health care, but we want to make sure anyone can afford preventative expenses."

Full-time remote working may follow, it has also said.
In an email sent today European Parliament staff have been instructed that teleworking will be introduced on March 16 — for “all colleagues whose physical presences in Parliament is not absolutely indispensable”.
“At this stage it will be 70% teleworking. That means presence in the office will be limited to 1½ days a week,” the email continues, adding: “Later on teleworking could be increased to 100% of working time dependent on the further developments.”
Earlier this week the parliament instructed “vulnerable” staff with pre-existing health conditions to telework to shrink their risk of exposure to the virus. The move followed the European Commission confirming its first cases of the disease.
The European Parliament is based in three locations in the EU, with the administrative offices in Luxembourg and plenary sessions of the parliament taking place in Brussels, Belgium, and Strasbourg in France.
We understand the teleworking shift applies across all locations.
The World Health Organization’s most recent Covid-19 situation report, for 10am CET March 10, lists a total of 1,402 confirmed cases in France; 239 in Belgium; and four in Luxembourg.
In recent days members of parliaments in several EU countries have also been reported to have contracted the virus — including politicians in Italy, Spain and the UK.
Another EU institution, the European Commission — which is primarily based in Brussels — is also allowing some staff to work remotely in response to the threat posed by the coronavirus, including staff with a pre-existing health condition and those who have recently traveled to regions it defines as high risk. It has also urged staff to take precautions, such as regular hand washing and social distancing.
It seems likely the Commission will follow the parliament’s lead and expand remote working further as confirmed cases of Covid-19 continue to increase. Local press in Belgium has reported 47 new cases today, including seven in Brussels.
The Belgian Federal Public Health service is also recommending businesses offer employees the option to work from home, postpone meetings and/or make use of video conferencing and avoid gathering large numbers of people in one place."

That notification on information is also automatically populated into the news feed for everyone who is in a country where the World Health Organization has reported a case of person-to-person transmission.“Given the developing situation, we’re working with national ministries of health and organizations like the WHO, CDC and UNICEF to help them get out timely, accurate information on the coronavirus,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re giving the WHO as many free ads as they need for their coronavirus response along with other in-kind support. We’ll also give support and millions more in ad credits to other organizations too and we’ll be working closely with global health experts to provide additional help if needed.”
To stop the spread of misinformation on the platform, Zuckerberg wrote that Facebook was removing false claims and conspiracy theories flagged by global health organizations and the company is blocking people from running ads that try to exploit the fears of the public by pitching snake oil cures.
Finally, and perhaps most problematically, Facebook is “looking at how people can use our services to help contribute to broader efforts to contain the outbreak,” Zuckerberg wrote. “Researchers are already using aggregated and anonymized Facebook data — including mobility data and population density maps — to better understand how the virus is spreading.”
There are open questions around what controls Facebook has put in place to restrict who has access to the anonymized data and what users might be able to do with that data — or how long they can maintain access once the threat from the virus abates. Facebook had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Technology from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is also helping with the medical efforts to halt the spread of the disease. Working with the Gates Foundation, researchers financed by the two organizations were able to fully sequence the genome of the virus that causes COVID-19 in a matter of days, making it easier for people infected with the virus to be identified.
That same team created a public version of the IDSeq tool so scientists could study the full genome in the context of other pathogens, Zuckerberg wrote.
Chan-Zuckerberg’s Biohub has also been working to develop a cell atlas, which maps different cell types in the body. Some researchers are using that atlas to try and assess how the coronavirus damages the lungs and identify potential treatments that could limit lung damage caused by the virus.
“There’s more we can do to help people feel less isolated and help one another and we’re working on some ideas we’ll share in the next few weeks, but for now the focus is on slowing the spread of the outbreak itself,” Zuckerberg wrote. “This is a difficult time for a lot of people and I’m thinking of everyone affected by this — the people who are sick or quarantined, their friends and family and of course the healthcare workers who are always on the frontlines of any outbreak. We’ll share more updates soon.”"

The study, based on a nose-swab should be able to return results in up to two days and will be shared with health officials who can then notify people who test positive. Individuals who have been infected will then be encouraged to answer an online questionnaire to give health officials information about their movements so that those officials can identify and notify other people who may need to be tested or quarantined, according to the Seattle Times report.
“Although there’s a lot to be worked out, this has enormous potential to turn the tide of the epidemic,” Scott Dowell, who leads the coronavirus response effort from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation told the Seattle Times.
There’s no clear timeline for the project’s launch as the Foundation looks to finalize the supporting software and draft a final questionnaire for people who request the tests. The Foundation estimates that it could run up to 400 tests per-day, according to Dowell.
The Gates Foundation isn’t the only entity moving quickly to develop at home test kits. In a Twitter thread on Saturday, serial healthcare entrepreneur Jonathan Rothenberg outlined a similar approach, and is apparently now in discussions with a manufacturer on how to bring it to market.
Seattle and the surrounding area has been the epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The state has confirmed 71 cases and 15 deaths from the disease as of Saturday. At least one health expert estimates that Seattle could have as many as 600 cases, based on computational modeling.
One of the most important things from our perspective, having watched and worked on this in other parts of the world, is the identification of people who are positive for the virus, so they can be safely isolated and cared for, and the identification of their contacts, who can then be quarantined, Dowell told the Seattle Times.
The project to do develop at-home testing evolved from a two-year-old research project from the University of Washington that was intended to track the spread of diseases like influenza, according to the Times reporting.
All told, the Gates Foundation has poured about $20 million into the effort. The foundation has also committed $5 million to the local response efforts to combat the disease in the area — including the expansion of testing and analysis."

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and emerging face of American leadership in the fight against the virus, estimated that the U.S. may see between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A deeply-respected authority on viral diseases, Fauci assisted in guiding the federal response to SARS, MERS, Ebola and now the novel coronavirus.
Fauci cautioned that these estimates are based on models and a model is only as accurate as the assumptions that go into building it. An extreme worst-case situation in which the coronavirus causes millions of American deaths remains “not impossible but very, very unlikely.”
“Whenever the models come in, they give a worst-case scenario and a best-case scenario,” Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Generally, the reality is somewhere in the middle. I’ve never seen a model of the diseases that I’ve dealt with where the worst case actually came out. They always overshoot.”
Fauci believes that the U.S. is likely going to have “millions of cases” but broadly cautioned against relying on modeling estimates while still stressing the extreme risk the virus poses.
“I just don’t think that we really need to make a projection when it’s such a moving target that we could so easily be wrong and mislead people,” Fauci said. He added that outbreaks in New York, New Orleans and other areas with “serious problems” remain worrisome, indicating that the data at hand is plenty of cause for concern.
As of Sunday morning, 2,197 people in the U.S. have lost their lives fighting the virus, with 125,313 confirmed cases in the country to date according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of actual cases of the virus on the ground is likely substantially higher, as testing challenges continue to trouble some parts of the country and many mild or asymptomatic cases go untested."

According to a revised 2020-2024 market forecast from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, a sizable increase in app downloads for industries like remote work and education will lead to a large surge in app installs for the early part of 2020 and beyond, despite other decreases in downloads for ride-sharing and fast food apps. However, the expected economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 will somewhat dampen revenue growth in the years ahead, the report found. Despite this, mobile app spending worldwide will continue to grow and will even double by 2024.
COVID-19’s impact on app stores’ revenue
Though COVID-19 is having an impact on the app stores’ revenue, growth remains strong.
Worldwide consumer spending in mobile apps is projected to reach $171 billion by 2024, which is more than double the $85 billion from 2019. This total, however, is about $3 billion (or 2%) less than the forecast the firm had released prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Still, it’s notable that even the slowest-growing regions on both app stores, Apple’s App Store and Google Play, will see revenue that’s over 80% higher than their 2019 levels by the year 2024.
The app stores will also hit several milestones during the next five years.
For starters, global spending in mobile apps will surpass $100 billion for the first time in 2020, growing at approximately 20% year-over-year to hit $102 billion.
Remarkably, the forecast also predicts that revenue from non-game mobile apps is expected to surpass that of mobile games for the first time by 2024, driven by the growth in subscriptions — particularly Entertainment, Social Networking, Music, and Lifestyle app subscriptions.
By this time, mobile games will reach $97.8 billion, or around 41% of total consumer spending. The App Store will account for a sizable chunk of that spending, with ~$57 billion in mobile game revenue in 2024 vs. Google Play’s ~$41 billion.
The App Store, not as surprisingly, will also maintain its sizable lead in consumer spending through 2024, accounting for 67% of total revenue across both it and Google Play. It will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.8% compared with Google Play’s 13.2%.
The top 5 countries by revenue will remain unchanged through 2024: China, U.S., Japan, Great Britain, and Taiwan. China will continue to be a top market, despite regulations on app and game publishing, and will reach $35 billion in App Store spending alone by 2024.
COVID-19’s impact on downloads
In terms of app downloads, the forecast predicts a lasting lift from the impacts of COVID-19.
By 2024, downloads will reach 183.7 billion, up 9% from the earlier forecast that came out before COVID-19 that had initially accounted for 7 billion fewer installs.
Much of this download growth is happening this year, when first-time app downloads are poised to reach 140.3 billion, up 22% from 2019.
In addition to increases in non-game apps — like education, grocery delivery, or remote work apps — mobile game downloads will grow 30% year-over-year in 2020 to reach 56.2 billion, compared with 10.4% growth between 2018 and 2019.
By 2024, mobile games will account for 41% of new installs, or 74.8 billion.
The early indication is that China will see a massive increase in downloads in 2020, particularly in Games and Education categories. This follows a drop in downloads over the past few years, due to government regulatory practices, like the games licensing freeze.
The U.S. will see a similar spike in downloads this year, also due to COVID-19. For 2020, this will lead to a 27% year-over-year increase in downloads. But by 2021 and in the years that follow, growth will settle around 7% annually from 2021 to 2024 in this market.
During the forecast time frame, download growth will slow in India and Brazil, as the markets become more saturated, while growing in Latin America (up 58%) and Asian markets outside of China (up 82%).
Another notable milestone may take place in 2022, when the U.S. pulls ahead of China in terms of App Store downloads to reach number one. The U.S. has been narrowing the gap between the two in recent years, from 3.5 billion in 2017 to 1.1 billion in 2019. It will continue to close the gap during parts of 2020 and 2021, as well.
Other top countries for downloads in 2024, besides the U.S. and China, include Japan, Great Britain, and Russia."

The global economy is undoubtedly being stressed by the pandemic, with small businesses especially being affected, and Google signal-boosting the World Health Organization and other government orgs with information to disseminate is a good move that more companies should follow.
As with any donation from a big tech company, it’s healthy to look at what recipients are getting and what the institution itself is earning.
Google’s ad business has taken a major pandemic hit as businesses that have temporarily closed up shop or reduced operations have also stopped advertising their services. Giving away hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of ads gets some of these businesses back to their advertising dashboards, lets Google boost the throughput of the competitive ad ecosystem and lands the company some solid goodwill in the process. Giving ads away to government orgs boosts goodwill that could be useful for future lobbying efforts, and bringing academics into the fold with Google Cloud credits could entice those institutions away from AWS or Azure."

Most of these are relatively simple, including around three or four questions that basically cover the top reported symptoms experienced by anyone who has confirmed to have had the disease. Chatbot-based symptom checking software startup Clearstep has created its own COVID-19 screener, which goes more in-depth to combine symptom checking with screening for potential exposure to the virus.
The reason Clearstep’s tool is designed to go a step further than most is simple, according to co-founder and COO Bilal Naved the symptoms reportedly suffered by those affected by COVID-19 include many that could indicate other serious conditions, including an impending heart attack. More effective and comprehensive screening can also help reduce the burden on an already heavily-taxed healthcare system, which seems likely to only get busier over time as the number of cases across the U.S. continues to climb.
Naved and cofounder Adeel Malik, both of whom have worked in health at Johns Hopkins University and been involved in a number of academic scientific publications, developed Clearstep as a front-line way to connect patients with the right care, using remote screening facilitated via chatbot on their desktop or mobile device. Clearstep’s aim fits naturally with one of the key needs in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic effective screening that can provide individuals with clear and accurate guidance about what steps they need to take to seek care, and when.
“Our country is entering a time of a lot of uncertainty, but but also a time where there could be a true, critical threat to the integrity of the healthcare system,” Naved said in an interview. “If the rate of infection of this really reaches some projections, we might not have enough hospital beds or ICU beds to deal with all of this […] So it’s all about urgency and speed here and rapid response, but also being able to deliver the highest quality product. We are built off of nurse protocols, and we’re the only ones that have access to this in a publicly available chatbot format that has been used in over 200 million encounters in over 95% of the call centers around the country.”
Clearstep’s screener asks a range of questions about symptoms, travel, potential contact with anyone either diagnosed with COVID-19 or likely to have it based on their own travel and other factors. Once you go through the questions, which are presented in a fairly standard and easy-to-follow chat message format, the tool provides you an evaluation of what next steps you should take. It’ll provide you advice about whether or not you need testing for COVID-19 based on current CDC guidelines about who should be tested and alert you about whether you should seek care for any other reason, independent of your potential coronavirus exposure.
The Clearstep team is also making sure to stay on top of new research as it emerges regarding the presentation and likelihood of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Their approach focuses on data-driven representation of the symptoms that most people are likely to have, and then also taking the less likely presenting symptoms and building a model wherein those compound and add up to a total. The team is “keeping a pulse in the literature” published in peer-reviewed sources and adapting its screener as it needs to, as well, Naved says.
Ultimately, Naved thinks that where Clearstep can contribute is in its ability to integrate quickly with healthcare providers, providing a triage tool that can give frontline responders a way to interface with the public safely, while also helping to ensure that all the health issues that are not related to COVID-19 but that are still serious and require care don’t get left behind.
“We were able to go from first conversation to contract signed to configured and implemented in total of nine days,” Naved says about their speed of response. “The contracts took six days and in three days, we we customized, put in behind their branding, integrate itd and deployed it out to an entire population in Florida for a health system there […] The symptom checkers that are being put out there need to be able to integrate with those places that are seeing the massive influx of volume and may not be able to handle it, because that’s our responsibility right now.”"

For anyone looking to supplement their existing knowledge of ongoing coronavirus and COVID-19 research, Frontiers is also offering a portal called the ‘Coronavirus Knowledge Hub,’ which includes links to the top research on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 symptoms, treatments, transmission and much more.
It’s crucial right now that research not go unfunded, since there’s a global urgency around the investigation into, and development of, potential solutions and treatments around COVID-19. There’s still a lot we just don’t know about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, even leaving aside the many potential treatments under development basic research about its genetic makeup, mutation patterns and durability are still pictures we need filled in to develop lasting and effective methods of prevention and protection.
A resource like this, which connects the dots between this work and available sources of funding, is incredibly valuable. Potential funders should get in touch with Frontiers via their submission form if they have a way to get much-needed resources to scientists working on this problem."

Many startups are undergoing staff cuts as the domestic and global economies slow, making individual reductions less newsworthy as the layoff tally rises. However, as BounceX is a company we’ve recently highlighted for its growth and capital efficiency, its own cuts are worth noting.
TechCrunch was tipped concerning the BounceX staff cuts and salary reductions earlier today, events that the company confirmed this afternoon. Our original tipster pegged the cuts at around 20% of staff, with pay cuts for the rest of its denizens.
The company confirmed the existence of salary cuts and layoffs, but did not affirm our figures. Here’s BounceX on its hard day; the firm confirmed pay cuts via a spokesperson separately from this comment:
COVID-19 has hit our client base really hard, especially if they had significant retail presence. In order to accommodate clients and help stabilize our business &amp; their businesses, we made the immensely difficult decision to move forward with a reduction in force. While we expected over 30% growth this year and adding 150 new roles by year end, we were forced to consolidate roles in order to do everything we could to take care of as many of our people as possible and continue to help our clients get through this.
It is not a surprise that BounceX was planning revenue growth and 150 new roles; the company recently crossed the $100 million ARR threshold, an event that TechCrunch covered as part of our long-running series focused on companies that reach the revenue threshold.
Indeed, in February, when BounceX shared the milestone, the firm also announced a rebrand, stating that it would change its name to Wunderkind. As you can read from the name, BounceX was feeling good at the time, looking to the future, proud of its growth and track record of efficient capital use.
As TechCrunch wrote at the time:
Wunderkind has been super efficient to date, with [CEO Ryan] Urban telling TechCrunch that the amount of equity [his company has] actually put to work is probably sub-$35 million, with less than $50 million in equity capital raised. The company also has debt lines that it can use, the CEO noted.
Given its history of conservative capital management, it doesn’t seem likely that BounceX is in existential danger after its layoffs. The company’s debt line — though we don’t know anything about its covenants — could provide more cushion. But its quick turnaround in fortunes shows how fast things can change.
The impact of COVID-19 on BounceX shows that no company, no matter how successful they were in February, is safe in April. Heck, TripActions was crowing about a huge new debt facility it secured right before COVID-19; the firm has since pared staff as well."

But amid business closures and shelter-in-place orders brought on by COVID-19, owner and father-of-three Sam Eitzen and his team of 18 had to get creative quickly to keep the company going. After Sam and his leadership team slashed their own salaries by 50% and held a nearly all-night brainstorm session, they pivoted SnapBars entire business strategy to ship and sell gift boxes packed with items crafted by local small businesses.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed on March 27 to help business owners like Sam via $350 billion in federal loans and grants. But major structural flaws and implementation issues are preventing these loans from getting to business owners quickly if at all and providing the level of help they need.
Small businesses and their employees have already run out of time. Data from my company Gusto, which provides payroll, benefits, compliance and HR software to 100,000 small businesses, shows that layoffs increased by more than 1,000% from February 2020 to March 2020.

Pay cuts for salaried employees which ranges from 30% for vice presidents, 20% for director-level executives and 10% for the remaining workforce is expected to be in place until the end of the second quarter, according to the email. The salary cuts and furloughs will begin April 13. Employees who cannot work from home and have not been assigned critical onsite positions will be furloughed until May 4, according to the email.
“While we are continuing to keep only minimum critical operations running, we expect to resume normal production at our U.S. facilities on May 4, barring any significant changes,” the email from Tesla’s human resources department head Valerie Workman. “Until that time, it is important we take action to ensure we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans.”
“This is a shared sacrifice across the company that will allow us to progress during these challenging times,” the email read.
Furloughed employees will remain employees of Tesla without pay. They will their healthcare benefit. The email directs furloughed employees to apply for unemployment benefits.
Tesla said in the email to employees that it will also put any merit-based actions such as equity grants on hold.
Tesla operates a number of factories and facilities throughout the U.S., namely its main assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., its Nevada gigafactory that produces battery packs and electric motors for the Model 3 and its factory in Buffalo, New York, which makes solar products.
Tesla announced March 19 plans to suspend production at its Fremont and Buffalo factories. At the time, the company didn’t say when it expected to restart production.
Tesla suspended production at its Fremont factory beginning March 23, a week after a shelter in place order went into effect in Alameda County due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some basic operations that support Teslas charging infrastructure and what it describes as its vehicle and energy services operations has continued at the factory, which under normal circumstances employs more than 10,000 people. About 2,500 workers are still working at the plant.
Tesla said in March that it had enough liquidity to weather the shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $6.3 billion before its recent $2.3 billion capital raise.
We believe this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty, Tesla said.
The company had available credit lines worth about  $3 billion, including working capital lines for all regions as well as financing for the expansion of its Shanghai factory at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019."

Layoffs are trickling down to all industries, starting in the hospitality and travel industry and moving to recruitment startups and scooter companies. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, which serves as a social media platform for professionals and recruiters alike, is thus poised to be a critical connector for those laid off.
So as job security remains on everyones mind, LinkedIns promise to not have any layoffs will quell some of that fear within the organization, at least in the near future. LinkedIn has approximately 16,000 full-time employees across 30 cities in the world.
Regardless of how healthy LinkedIn may appear from this news, its not immune from making specific cost-saving measures as the economy struggles. The company, reports The Information, has paused most of its hiring as it figures out business planning. It had more the 1 million job applicants last year, according to the piece."

Google and Apple announced a joint effort last Friday to create a voluntary anonymous contact tracing network enabled by Android and iOS that would monitor the spread of infections by keeping track of people who are infected and those with whom they come into contact. People would download mobile apps from public health officials that would notify them if they had come into close proximity with infected people who also are using the network. The system would use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions, rather than GPS, so the location would not be tracked, and the tracking data would be stored on the phone and not in a centralized database all of which will help maintain the privacy of participants.
However, there are numerous other COVID-19 mitigation efforts that are not as privacy-friendly because they employ location tracking and, most likely, central data storage.
Google announced it will release Community Mobility Reports that show trends over time by geography based on anonymized aggregated data from phones of people who have turned on the Location History setting. Facebook and other companies are providing to epidemiologists from around the world anonymized, aggregated data from mobile phones as part of the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network.
And the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is tracking the anonymized movements of American citizens based on location data from mobile advertising companies. While privacy advocates consider these sort of tracking mechanisms to be invasive and unsettling, this data does help to reveal the public spaces still drawing crowds and guide subsequent policy decisions, but it raises concerns.
While I applaud government efforts to more effectively stop the spread of infections, there needs to be specific conditions and limitations on how this data is used, or we as a nation will face serious consequences. The government must mobilize to combat this invisible enemy, but we must also have parameters for how data is protected and used. Specifically, we need five guarantees.
Temporality
The PATRIOT Act, passed just six weeks after 9/11, gave the government unprecedented power to spy on American citizens. This may have made sense at the time, but the government continues to vacuum up millions of phone calls and text messages to this day. If companies like Google and Facebook are willing to share data with the government, there needs to be a clear and defined period as to the time span of the sharing and the retention period of that shared data.
Civil liberties
Following the September 11th attacks, law enforcement departments like the NYPD conducted illegal surveillance activities of the local Muslim population. That program has been compared to the Japanese-American internment camps of World War II and the FBIs surveillance of African Americans who opposed segregation in the civil rights movement.
We must not allow this current pandemic to become another example of civil liberties falling by the wayside. The data being shared to protect us now cannot be used for surveillance or discrimination tactics, now or in the future.
Transparency
Any company that shares sensitive data with the government, such as location data, must be required to provide timely and fulsome transparency reports that are easy for the public to interpret.
Limited use and purpose specification
The OECDs Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) state that personal data should not be used for any purpose beyond the specified purpose of the data processing activity. Weve witnessed numerous media exposés and regulatory actions against companies sharing location data for secondary purposes. In this case, location data collected and used to limit the spread of the virus should only be used for that specific purpose.
Data security
The governments well-meaning intentions to protect citizens does not automatically mean it will secure their sensitive data. If anything, there will likely be an uptick in cybercrime during the pandemic. The government owes it to its citizens to ensure the appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards are in place.
As U.S. officials explore their options, its unclear what lessons from history or types of data protections, if any, are actually being discussed. We can only go on what weve heard from news reports: Palantir, the data mining company that uses War on Terror tools to track Americans, is in talks with the CDC to do data collection related to disease tracking.
Facial recognition company Clearview AI, which has been harshly criticized for selling its software to law enforcement, private companies and authoritarian regimes, is talking to state agencies about using its data-driven insights to track infections. Unacast has been giving local counties social-distancing grades based on citizens location data.
Let freedom ring
The U.S. does need to find a practical path forward. There are actually several different types of location data collected, used and shared by a variety of different commercial entities — so it would be best to first determine which data is most valuable and who are the key  partners. Doctors, researchers, academics, ethicists and legal experts should be actively included in conversations with these tech companies.
In addition, privacy preserving techniques must be used when sharing location data. The Apple-Google joint effort is the latest; others include Private Kit: Safe Paths and MITs SafeTrace platform, which also allow users to voluntarily share data through means that are anonymized, decentralized and encrypted.
The challenge here is that it’s difficult to actually guarantee that anonymized data (data that has no chance of identifying a person) is truly anonymous, without being subject to additional contractual, technical and administrative controls. And platforms that rely on users voluntarily submitting their location and health status could end up with a low adoption rate, leading to skewed and inaccurate results.
Should it then be left up to our government to mandate all American citizens with a smartphone share their location data in the name of public health? Whatever happens, now, more than ever, its imperative that our local, state and federal authorities take into account the various data sharing proposals in a manner that puts the American citizen first."

The model, described in a new report, proves accurate when trained on data spanning late January to early March in terms of anticipating the actual spread leading up to April 1 in different regions around the world, and it indicates that any immediate or near-term relaxation or reversal of quarantine measures currently in place would lead to an “exponential explosion” in the number of infections.
Researchers at MIT sought to develop a model based just on COVID-19 data, whereas others have used SARS or MERS information to inform their charting of the outbreak’s progress. Combining available COVID-19 info with a neural network-based estimation of the number of infected individuals who are under effective quarantine, and therefore no longer a likely risk of infection to others, allows theirs to go beyond existing models in terms of accurately modelling and predicting the effect of social distancing and isolation measures and the impact should those measures be curtailed or withdrawn.
MIT’s model shows that the current infection plateau for COVID-19 in the U.S. and Italy will both take place sometime in the next week or so, which matches existing predictions available. That sounds like promising news, and it is in terms of the number of infected patients, and the impact on the healthcare system, but it absolutely should not be interpreted as meaning that this is when it’s okay to start relaxing the measures in place.
In fact, the study concludes that by “relaxing quarantine measures too soon, we have predicted that the consequences would be far more catastrophic,” according to model developer and MIT mechanical engineering professor George Barbastathis, when compared to a similar second-wave resurgence that occurred in Singapore after it began relaxing its own measures too early."

Some of these funds are being directed towards major health organizations, like CDC and WHO, while others are aimed at helping individuals or smaller businesses.
The $250 million includes three separate efforts: the TikTok Health Heroes Relief Fund, TikTok Community Relief Fund, and TikTok Creative Learning Fund.
The first is the most significant effort as it provisions $150 million in funds for things like medical staffing, supplies, and hardship relief for health care workers. Included in these distributions is $15 million to the CDC Foundation to support surge staffing for local response efforts through state and local governments, and $10 million for the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. 
In addition, TikTok, which owned by Chinese internet giant ByteDance, said its employee matching program will deliver aid to organizations like the Red Cross and Direct Relief.
TikTok also said it’s working with global and local partners to deliver masks and other personal protective equipment to hospitals in India, Indonesia, Italy, South Korea, and the U.S., among others. Earlier this month, TikTok announced it had donated 400,000 hazmat medical protective suits and 200,000 masks to protect doctors and front line medical staff in India, for example.
The TikTok Community Relief Fund, meanwhile, is focused in particular on vulnerable communities impacted by COVID-19.
This effort involves allotting $40 million in cash for local organizations that serve representatives of TikTok’s user community — including musicians, artists, nurses, educators, and families. The fund has already been used to donate $3 million to After-School All-Stars, which is providing food for families who had previously relied on school lunches, and $2 million for MusiCares which supports artists, songwriters, and music professionals whose livelihoods have been disrupted.
As a part of the Community Relief Fund, TikTok will also be matching $10 million in donations from its community.
The third effort, TikTok’s Creative Learning Fund, will provide $50 million in grants to educators, professional experts, and nonprofits working on distance learning efforts. TikTok sees itself as a potential home for creative remote learning efforts but didn’t announce any specific plans on this front.
Outside of the funds themselves, TikTok is extending ad credits to health organizations and SMBs.
The company is providing $25M in prominent “in-feed” advertising space for NGOs, trusted health sources, and local authorities, allowing them to share their important messages with millions of people, it said. Other major tech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have done the same on their own platforms.
TikTok noted it has worked to spread educational information in other ways, as well, having hosted livestreams from representatives of WHO, IFRC, and other popular voices in public health and science, including Bill Nye the Science Guy. There’s also a dedicated section in TikTok with other resources: the COVID-19 Resources Page on TikTok’s Safety Center. And it’s partnered with creators on campaigns like #HappyAtHome, which airs live programming at 8:00 PM ET/ 5:00 PM PT on Fridays and has other themed experiences planned during weekdays.
TikTok will also offer $100 million in advertising credits to small and medium-sized businesses trying to get back on their feet in the months ahead. This effort hasn’t yet started, as it will depend on the decisions made by public health authorities about the re-opening of businesses, the company explained.
“We understand that these are challenging times for everyone,” wrote TikTok President, Alex Zhu, in an announcement. “Alongside businesses, governments, NGOs, and ordinary people across the globe stepping up in this critical moment, we are committed to offering the very best that we can to help out humanity. Together, we will persevere through this time of crisis and emerge a better community and part of a world that we fervently hope will be more united in common purpose than it was before,” Zhu added."

Company co-founder Matt Whitteker, says the Ottawa startup focuses on supply chain data management, which means it has the data and the tooling to develop a data-driven supply chain map based on WHO data identifying COVID hotspots. He believes that his is the only company to have done this.
“We’re the only ones that have taken supply chain data and applied it to this particular pandemic. And it’s something that’s really native to our platform. We have all that data on hand — we have location data for suppliers. So it’s just a matter of applying that with third party data sources (like the WHO data), and then extracting valuable business intelligence from it,” he said.
If you want to participate, you simply go to the company website and fill out a form. A customer success employee will contact you and walk you through the process of uploading your data to the platform. Once they have your data, they generate a map showing the parts of the world where your supply chain is most likely to be disrupted, identifying the level of risk based on your individual data.
The company captures supply chain data as part of the act of doing business with 1000 customers and 500,000 suppliers currently on their platform. “When companies are manufacturing products they have what’s called a bill of materials, kind of like a recipe. And companies upload their bill of materials that basically outlines all their parts, components and commodities, and who they get them from, which basically represents their supply chain,” Whitteker explained.
After the company uploads the bill of materials, Assent opens a portal for the companies to exchange data, which might be tax forms, proof of sourcing or any kind of information and documentation the manufacturer needs to comply with legal and regulatory rules around procurement of a given part.
They decided to start building the COVID-19 map application when they recognized that this was going to have the biggest supply chain disruption the world has seen since World War II. It took about a month to build it. It went into Beta last week with customers and over 350 signed up in the first two hours. This week, they made the tool generally available to anyone, even non-customers, for free.
The company was founded in 2016 and raised $220 million, according to Whitteker."

The study, published in Nature, shows performance on par with existing PCR-based molecular tests, the one ones currently authorized for use by the FDA to test for the novel coronavirus.
Mammoth’s DETECTR platform is designed to have advantages over traditional testing methods in a few different ways, including in its reconfigurability to address new viruses, since it uses CRISPR to target specific genetic sequences, and activate a “cleavage” that effectively acts as a signal for the diagnostic equipment to pick up. Basically, in the same way CRISPR allows scientists to target a specific string of DNA for removal or alteration, with scalpel-like precision, Mammoth’s diagnostic allows for programmable, targeted matching with a reference string, leading to confirmation that viral RNA is present in the patient.
The test that Mammoth is developing showed validated use in under two weeks, the researchers claim, since their platform is designed from the ground up for rapid reconfigurability to address new viral threats. The test can deliver results in under 45 minutes, and the results delivery is via what’s called a ‘lateral flow strip,’ which is essentially the same kind of read-out you see with at-home pregnancy tests, making them relatively easy to interpret. DETECTR also doesn’t require a lab setting to delver results, and instead can be conducted with portable heat blocks, combined with commonly available standard reagents.
In the study, which included samples from 36 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections, and 42 patients who had other types of viral respiratory infections, the tests showed 95% positive diagnostic accuracy, and 100% negative efficacy. Samples used were taken from respiratory swabs.
This doesn’t mean this test can roll out to actual sites for use, but it’s a good validation of Mammoth’s model and test design, and could eventually lead to actual deployment of its test in a clinical setting, providing other, larger-scale studies back up the data."

India amended its foreign direct investment policy on Saturday to include China in the list of neighboring nations that will need to seek approval from New Delhi for their future deals in the country. Previously, only Pakistan and Bangladesh were subjected to this requirement.
The nations Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade said it was taking this measure to curb the opportunistic takeover of Indian firms that are grappling with challenges due to the coronavirus crises.
The new rule will also be applicable to “the transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an entity in India, directly or indirectly,” the ministry said.
“There has been a growing concern across the globe that Chinese companies are buying cheap, distressed asset. Government may be thinking that if this is allowed to continue, this may cause some security concerns,” said Nikhil Narendran, a Bangalore-based lawyer.
The move comes at a time when major investors in India have cautioned local startups to prepare for a tough period ahead. Earlier this month, they told startup founders that raising fresh capital is likely be more challenging than ever for the next few months.
Data from research firm Tracxn showed that startups have already started to face the pressure. Indian startups participated in 79 deals to raise $496 million in March, down from $2.86 billion that they raised across 104 deals in February and $1.24 billion they raised from 93 deals in January this year, according to Tracxn. In March last year, Indian startups had raised $2.1 billion across 153 deals, the firm said.
Narendran said India is following similar efforts from other countries such as Australia that have tighten their foreign direct investment policies.
Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent have emerged as some of the biggest investors in Indian startups in recent years. Over a dozen additional firms and venture funds in China have stepped up their efforts in scouting deals in India.
Some of India’s biggest startups including Flipkart, Paytm, ShareChat, and Zomato are backed by Chinese VCs.
Rahul Gandhi, the former head of political party Indian Nation Congress, urged the ruling government earlier this month to take measures to prevent “foreign interests from taking control of any Indian corporate at this time of national crisis.”"

The researchers performed a study on 30 confirmed COVID-19 patients, treating each with either hydroxychloroquine on its own, a combination of the medicine with the antibiotic, as well as a control group that received neither. The study was conducted after reports from treatment of Chinese patients indicated that this particular combo had efficacy in shortening the duration of infection in patients.
The patient mix included in the study included six who showed no symptoms whatsoever, as well as 22 who had symptoms in their upper respiratory tract (things like sneezing, headaches and sore throats, and eight who showed lower respiratory tract symptoms (mostly coughing). 20 of the 30 participants in the study received treatment, and the results showed that while hydroxycholoroquine was effective on its own as a treatment, when combined with azithromycin it was even more effective, and by a significant margin.
These results represent a limited study with a small number of patients, but they are promising, especially when combined with earlier reports from patients in China with the same treatment options. Researchers globally are testing a number of potential treatments, including a range of drugs used previously in the efforts to combat Ebola, SARS, HIV and other global outbreaks.
There are no confirmed effective treatments specifically for COVID-19 to date, but regulators and medical researchers everywhere are working hard to get through the process of testing and approvals in search of something that can at least reduce the duration or severity of symptoms in patents. Vaccine development is also underway, but any approved and effective COVID-19 vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, even with resources redirected towards developing one as fast as is safety possible."

Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s philanthropic project the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is collaborating with UCSF and the medical research nonprofit the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub to expand COVID-19 testing in Silicon Valley’s backyard.
The collaboration will mean that UCSF, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and other local Department of Public Health sites will be able to bring additional testing online as the pandemic threatens the health of communities around the globe. USCF’s goal is to test at least 1,000 people per day in its lab “within the coming days.”
The increased testing capacity will prioritize UCSF inpatients, then outpatients displaying symptoms of the virusa group that has largely gone untested. Currently, UCSF can administer between 60 and 100 tests per day.
Chan Zuckerberg Biohub co-president Joe DeRisi described the effort as a “sprint” to increase clinical testing capacity. The private partnership will provide more than just purchases of testing equipment, including “operational support, informatics, and protocol development.” In 2003, DeRisi’s research contributed to the identification of SARS, a coronavirus related to the COVID-19 virus.
The partnership between the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and UCSF’s testing lab was made possible by an executive order from California Governor Gavin Newsom, issued when the governor declared a state of emergency in early March.
“Dramatically expanded testing capacity as well as rapid deployment of testing to all those who need it is essential to stemming the spread of COVID-19,” CZI co-founder and co-CEO Dr. Priscilla Chan said.
In California, 22 public health labs were performing COVID-19 tests as of early this week. As of Wednesday, California had tested 12,600 people, with 585 testing positive."

While the world may be topsy-turvy at the moment, keeping your customer at the center of your business strategy is more important than ever.
That means finding creative ways to engage with your customers and thinking deeply about what they need as the world changes before our eyes.
As a small example on a local level, Pandemonium Books and Games in Cambridge, Massachusetts has started offering same-day delivery to neighborhoods in the Boston area for a $5 fee and a $20 minimum purchase.
This is taking a difficult situation and finding a way to stay connected with customers, while keeping the business going through difficult times. It’s something that your most loyal customers will certainly remember when we return to some semblance of normalcy and it’s just a great community service.
When you hear from leaders of the world’s most successful technology companies, whether it’s Jeff Bezos at Amazon or Marc Benioff at Salesforce, these two executives are constantly pushing their organizations to put the customer first.
At Amazon, that manifests itself in the company motto that it’s always Day 1. That motto means they never can become complacent and always place the customer first. In his 2016 Letter to Shareholders, Bezos described what he meant:
There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.
Benioff runs his company with a similar world view, and it’s no coincidence that both companies are so wildly successful. In his recent book, Trailblazer, Benioff wrote about the importance of relentless customer focus:
Nothing a company does is more essential than how it engages with customers. In a world where online portals are replacing customer service centers and algorithms are replacing humans on the front lines, companies like ours continually need to show that the personal connections our customers craved were still and always would be there.
In our current crisis, that focus becomes ever more important and universal. In his last interview before his death in January, Clayton Christensen, author of the seminal book Innovator’s Dilemma, told MIT Sloan Management Review that while these organizations had other things going for them, customer centricity was certainly a big factor in their success.
They have all built organizations that have put the customers, and their Job to Be Done, at the center. They also have demonstrated the ability to manage emergent strategy well. However, they also have been in the fortunate circumstance where their core businesses have been growing at phenomenal rates, and they have had the presence of the founder to help, to personally get involved in key strategic decisions.
While you don’t want to appear like you are taking advantage of a bad situation, there are ways you can help your customers by thinking of new ways engage and help them in a difficult time. Many companies are offering services for free for the next several months to help customers get through the financial uncertainty we are facing in the near term. Others are posting free content and access to other resources on websites.
While it’s understood that some customers simply won’t have money to spend in the coming months, those that do will have different needs than they did before and you have to be ready to address them, whatever that means to your business.
This virus is going to force us to rethink about a lot of the ways we run our businesses, our society and our lives, but if you keep your customer at the center of all your decisions, even in the midst of such a crisis, you will be setting the foundation for a successful business whenever we return to normal."

From tomorrow (March 20) until April 19 the package — which Just Eat says is worth £10M+ — will see funds directed back to UK partner restaurants in the form of a commission rebate of one third (33%) on all commissions paid to Just Eat by restaurants; and via the removal of commissions across all collection orders which it intends to help reduce pressure on restaurants delivery operations, where collection is still available.
Just Eat also said it’s waiving all sign-up fees for new restaurants joining its platform (which must still meet its standard conditions, such as being registered with the relevant local authority as a food business and having the required hygiene rating); and relaxing any existing arrangements that may be in place with partners to enable them to work with delivery aggregators — “regardless of existing contractual terms”.
It added that it will continue to pay restaurants weekly, including the rebate now in place.
Currently Just Eat has around 35,700 restaurants on its platform in the UK, with delivery available to 95% of UK postcodes.
Commenting in a statement, Andrew Kenny, Just Eat’s UK MD, said:
These are some of the most challenging times the restaurants we work with have ever been through. We want to show our support and help them to keep their doors open, so they can focus on doing what they do best — delivering food to people across the UK every day. We know our Restaurant Partners are worried about their teams — from chefs to delivery drivers — and these measures will go some way to helping them maintain their operations and support their people.
The food delivery industry has a crucial role to play at this time of national crisis and it is only right that as the market leader in the UK Just Eat steps up to help our independent partners so they can keep delivering for the communities that need them.
In the UK and elsewhere there is rising concern about the economic impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality sector as people are told to stay away from social spaces.
On Monday the UK government advised people not to go to bars and restaurants or other social spaces in a bid to try to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although, unlike many other European countries, it has not yet issued strict quarantine measures such as ordering hospitality industry businesses to close their doors and citizens to work at home where possible.
On-demand food delivery remains one of the services that continues to operate even in locked down EU Member States. However with gig economy business models not typically offering platform workers an employment safety net of benefits such as sick pay the entire sector has come under fresh scrutiny for the legal status it assigns to delivery couriers, given the heightened risks posed to them by the novel coronavirus. In a nutshell it they need to self isolate they won’t be able to earn. 
In its press release today Just Eat said it’s working on other unspecified support initiatives for couriers, as well as for groups including the vulnerable and isolated, and frontline workers. 
These will be announced in due course, it added. 
Although it also notes that the vast majority of orders placed through its network are delivered by restaurants with their own delivery capability. Its commission for such orders is a maximum of 14%, it added.
Some on-demand food delivery startups operating in Europe which do rely on gig workers to make deliveries have already announced emergency support funds to help platform workers who fall ill or need to self isolate during the COVID-19 crisis — including UK-based Deliveroo and Spain’s Glovo.
Although there has also been some criticism of how easy it is for couriers to access claimed support."

Both of these new offerings are the same in terms of approach to testing: They deliver swab-based sample collection hardware that people can use at home to collect a mucus sample which they then ship back using including safety approved, projective packaging to be tested by one of the existing FDA-approved commercial labs across the country.
These tests follow the PCR-based method, which tests for the genetic presence of the COVID-19 virus in a patient. These have a high degree of accuracy, at least when performed in a controlled setting and administered by a medical professional, and are the same tests that are available via drive-through testing stations being set up by state agencies.
At-home use is relatively new to market, and could introduce some potential for error in the collection part of the process, but both Caron Health and Nurx are offering consultation with medical professionals to help ensure that samples are collected properly, and that results, when available, are correctly interpreted and provided with guidance on next steps for those taking the tests.
None of these tests are free the Carbon Health test costs $167.50, and the Nurx test costs $181, including shipping and assessment. These are in line with other offerings, including the one from Everlywell we covered earlier this week, which retails for $135. These are described as essentially at-cost prices, and all parties say they are subject to coverage by FSA or HSA money, or potentially by insurers depending on a person’s plan.
One big question around these types of tests is how much supply will be available. Nasopharyngeal swabs used for the in-person type of testing are already reportedly in short supply in some regions, and testing needs are only growing. Carbon is using different swabs to collect a simple saliva sample, which it notes are not in as short supply as the nasopharyngeal version. Other types of tests, including a ‘serological’ one being developed by startup Scanwell, instead work by analyzing a patient’s blood, and could provide some relief for the swab-based tests, especially now that the FDA has expanded its emergency guidance to include their use.
Nurx, which also offers at-home HPV screening, says that it will have 10,000 kits available to patients “over the coming weeks,” and hopes to expand to cover “over 100,000 patients” in the “near future.” Carbon Health CEO and co-founder Eren Bali tells me that it should ramp to around “10,000 per day capacity in about two weeks” through its medical device partner Curative Inc, and that it can do 50 per day today, with an estimated increase to 150 per day by Monday and 1,000 per day by end of week.
All of these tests are gated by a screening and assessment questionnaire, and the round trip time is likely to take a few days even with round-trip shipping due to testing times. It may seem like a lot of these are popping up, but these startups at least have proven track records in healthcare services, and there will be a need for very widespread testing in order for any broad attempt to flatten the curve of the virus to prove successful, so expect more of these providers to come on line."

Disney has also said it will work to shrink bandwidth used by its streaming service, Disney+, which is due to begin launching in Europe from tomorrow.
Last week Netflix, YouTube and Amazon said they would switch to SD streaming by default in the region.
The EU’s executive has expressed concerned about the load on Internet infrastructure during the coronavirus crisis as scores of citizens log on from home to work or try to keep themselves entertained during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Telcos in the region have reported significant increases in traffic as EU Member States have called for or instructed citizens to stay at home during the public health emergency.
Collectively, streaming platforms account for a major chunk of global Internet traffic. Online video accounted for more than 60% of the total downstream volume of traffic per a 2019 Sandvine report — while in another report last month it said YouTube alone accounted for a quarter of all mobile traffic.
To help alleviate any potential network congestion, we will temporarily reduce bit rates for videos on Facebook and Instagram in Europe, a Facebook spokesman also told Reuters yesterday.
We’ve reached out to Facebook with questions.
Per Reuters the measure will remain in place for as long as there are concerns about the region’s Internet infrastructure.
In related news Disney is pressing ahead with a planned launch of its new video streaming service, Disney+, in Europe starting from tomorrow but Bloomberg reports it will also take measures to reduce bandwidth utilization by at least 25% in European markets.
We will be monitoring Internet congestion and working closely with Internet service providers to further reduce bitrates as necessary to ensure they are not overwhelmed by consumer demand, said Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disneys direct-to-consumer division, in a statement.
Last week the company said it would postpone the launch of Disney+ in India after the biggest local attraction — the Indian Premier League cricket tournament — was rescheduled due to the coronavirus outbreak."

Many of these efforts are just entering into the formal clinical study phase, which will be required before any treatment is certified for widespread use in patients diagnosed with the illness. Vaccines are still likely at least a year out from approvals, though some have already entered into clinical human trials at unprecedented speed owing to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic.
It’s definitely a challenge to keep up with all the existing efforts to pursue effective treatments and develop vaccines, but public health non-profit the Milken Institute has a new resource that aims to keep track of at least the efforts from leading research institutions and drug makers. Their COVID-19 treatment and vaccine tracker currently offers a list of nearly 60 treatments, as well as 43 vaccines in development.
This list details the type of treatment or vaccine being studied or developed, as well as their FDA-approved status (for other conditions none have been approved specifically for treating COVID-19 to date). They also indicate who is doing the drug development or research, and what stage the research project is at (either pre-clinical or clinical). The table lists the source of funding, if available, as well as the anticipated timetable for the phases of the project if known. It provides sourcing for each, as well, including credible media sources, journals and the World Health Organization.
This kind of tracker is a good resource for anyone looking to keep tabs on the ongoing work that people are doing to take on COVID-19, though it’s a high-level view that is probably of most interest to other ongoing projects, as well as health and research professionals who might be able to assist in the development of these solutions, or to collaborate with partners. The Milken Institute says that it’s going to be updating the tracker daily at noon eastern with any additional fresh info from reliable sources.
As mentioned, even vaccines that are already in development, like the mRNA-based immune therapy that began human trials last week in the U.S., will take many months to come to market, and they still have to demonstrate their effectiveness, too. In the meantime, people should do everything they can to isolate and remain indoors in order to help buy time for the healthcare system to develop treatments that can mitigate the impact of the disease, and eventually, ways to introduce immunity in order to block its transmission."

Previously, YouTube’s advertising guidelines prevented monetization of videos that included more than a passing mention of the coronavirus as part of its “sensitive events” policy. The policy is meant to protect advertisers from being associated with videos about things like mass shootings, terrorist acts, armed conflicts, and global health crises — like the coronavirus. Now, YouTube is changing this policy to allow some creators to monetize videos on the topic, it says.
The creator community was unhappy with YouTube’s decision to demonetize any video featuring discussions of the coronavirus. (Though, to be fair, YouTube creators are generally unhappy when YouTube demonetizes any of their videos.)
But by not allowing creators to profit from videos about the coronavirus or COVID-19, YouTube was putting a damper on informative, newsworthy videos as well as those capitalizing on the human tragedy and people’s fears about the emerging pandemic. The ban on monetization also meant that news organizations covering the topic responsibly wouldn’t be able to generate revenue from their videos, even as coronavirus news became one of their main coverage areas.
Today, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki explained the company’s decision to re-open monetization on videos referencing the health crisis.
She says that the sensitive events policy was designed to apply to short-term events of a significant magnitude, like a natural disaster.
“Its becoming clear this issue is now an ongoing and important part of everyday conversation,” Wojcicki said, in reference to the coronavirus, “And we want to make sure news organizations and creators can continue producing quality videos in a sustainable way,” she added.
Not all video creators will be eligible to monetize their coronavirus videos, she notes.
Instead, YouTube says ads will be enabled on “a limited number of channels” including those belonging to news partners and creators “who accurately self-certify.” The latter is a more questionable choice, as it opens up monetization to any creator using YouTube’s self-labeling system, not just news organizations or trusted health authorities.
The Self Certification system is one where creators use an online dashboard to tell YouTube whether or not their videos comply with advertiser guidelines ahead of YouTube’s automated review of their content. Over time, YouTube will rely on creators’ input instead of its own systems if the creators have a history of accurate self-certifications. It’s an honor system, essentially, followed by an official check. 
The system doesn’t prevent creators from publishing misinformation in their videos, then labeling the video as advertiser-friendly. In addition, many creators believe that the bogus information they’re sharing is correct and true, so a self-certification system wouldn’t stop them from publishing their misleading and often dangerous advice. Already, YouTube has to work to quickly remove videos like that. This includes videos discouraging people from seeking medical treatment or making dangerous claims — like how garlic or bleach can prevent the viral disease, for example.
To fight misinformation, YouTube is also raising authoritative sources in its search results and recommendations and is showing information panels on which videos are flagged.
Despite these efforts, there continues to be a massive amount of misinformation circulating across social media, including on sites like Facebook and Twitter, in addition to YouTube. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus even referred to the crisis as not just an epidemic, but “an infodemic.” (WHO today has upgraded the COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic, as well.)
In light of the misinformation problem, YouTube’s decision to open up monetization on videos about the coronavirus will be a controversial choice. In doing so, it signals to the creator community that one the most-searched topics on the internet can now be leveraged for views and ad dollars. That invites exploitation."

The employees were not symptomatic in the office, and both are quarantined at home and recovering well, according to the email from Tesla’s EHS department head Laurie Shelby. Their co-workers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were notified so they can quarantine, the email read. The email did not disclose the locations where the employees were working.
“In both cases, interactions with the individuals had a low likelihood of transmission based on the minimal staff onsite and social distancing measures we took earlier this month,” Shelby wrote in the email.
Tesla could not be reached for comment. Business Insider previously reported on the same internal email.
The email has heightened concern among several Tesla employees that TechCrunch has spoken to, as they weigh the risk of coming into work or using paid-time off or unpaid leave to stay at home. Tesla employs more than 48,000 people at its headquarters, factories, sales and service centers and delivery hubs throughout the U.S. While some employees are able to work from home, the company still has workers at its delivery and service centers as well as an estimated 2,500 people at its Fremont, Calif. factory.
Tesla suspended production at its Fremont factory beginning March 23, days after a shelter-in-place order went into effect in Alameda County due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some basic operations that support Teslas charging infrastructure and what it describes as its vehicle and energy services operations have continued at the factory, which under normal circumstances employs more than 10,000 people.
The decision to suspend production at Fremont came after a multi-day public tussle between the automaker and local officials in Alameda County over what was considered an essential business.
Tesla has also suspended operations at its factory in Buffalo, N.Y., except for those parts and supplies necessary for service, infrastructure and critical supply chains, the company said in a statement. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Wednesday that he plans to reopen the Buffalo factory to produce ventilators, a critical piece of medical equipment used in severe cases of COVID-19.
The email comes just two days after reports of at least two positive COVID-19 cases at SpaceX, another company headed up Musk. The positive cases at SpaceX sent some employees into quarantine, CNBC reported. The company is making hand sanitizer in house and taking other steps to protect nervous workers, according to CNBC. TechCrunch could not reach SpaceX for comment.
COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has rippled through corporate and industrial America. Manufacturers have suspended production of vehicles, tech companies have ordered employees to work from home and city, county and state governments have issued a variety of orders to try and slow the spread of COVID-19.
For instance, California Gv. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home directive that ordered all nonessential businesses to close and for residents to only leave their homes for essential needs like groceries or to visit the pharmacy. Other states where Tesla has operations such as New York are also under a stay-at-home order.
Musk’s actions during the pandemic have caused a variety of reactions among employees, critics and his millions of Twitter followers. He has appeared dismissive of COVID-19 in emails to employees and on Twitter, where he has spread a misinformation on the disease, including that children are “essentially immune,” a statement that contradicts with information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In one internal email sent to SpaceX employees, Musk noted that they were more likely to die in a car crash than from the disease. 
Even as Musk seemed to downplay the disease, he has also stepped up to donate medical supplies needed by hospitals and has directed employees to not come to work if they feel ill or are uncomfortable. Tesla employees have received emails from human resources head Valerie Workman that if they could not or were reluctant to come to work they could use PTO or take unpaid time off after they exhaust their PTO. The email told one employee (who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity) that they would be not be penalized for their decision or face disciplinary action for attendance based on health or impossibility to come to work.
Musk has also donated essential personal protective equipment to hospitals that are facing a shortage of these supplies and has committed to trying to help ramp up production of ventilators."

The “enforcement discretion policy” applies retroactively to March 13, with no end date set yet.
“EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes the challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements,” said EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in the agencys announcement.
The policy “addresses different categories of noncompliance differently.” For example, the EPA said it will not seek penalties for noncompliance with monitoring and reporting “that are the result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” but that it still expects public water systems to provide safe drinking water.
The new policy follows lobbying from industries including oil and gas, which told the Trump administration that relaxed regulations will allow them to more efficiently distribute fuel during the outbreak.
But critics say that the policy will not only result in more pollution, but also make it impossible to fully assess the environmental damage.
In a statement to the Hill, Cynthia Giles, who headed the EPAs Office of Enforcement during the Obama administration, said the new policy “tells companies across the country that they will not face enforcement even if they emit unlawful air and water pollution in violation of environmental laws, so long as they claim that those failures are in some way caused by the virus pandemic. And it allows them an out on monitoring too, so we may never know how bad the violating pollution was.”"

Mesa’s test is also small enough to be able to be used right at the frontline of care, including in clinics and hospitals, with multiple tests able to be run in parallel.
Mesa’s rapid test follows one from Cepheid that was approved on Monday. Both are PCR-based molecular tests, which identify the presence of virus DNA in a sample of a patient’s mucus. Both these tests prevent an important expansion of the technologies available to those looking to combat the spread of the new coronavirus, since they can provide lab-quality results, but can do so much faster, and without requiring transportation of the samples from the point of collection to off-site testing facilities.
On-site testing not only has advantages in terms of convenience and speedy return of results, but also in limiting the potential exposure of medical personnel to the virus itself. Testing on-site means you don’t need to worry about possible exposure to the virus for more people in the chain, including logistics and delivery people, as well as lab technicians and dedicated diagnostics people.
These tests will require that facilities are equipped with Mesa’s Accula testing system, but its equipment is already in use for testing flu, as well as other less serious equipment, and it was originally designed specifically to address use on the frontlines of efforts to combat global pandemics, including SARS before this."

But, as a gray footnote to all tragedies, were starting to see innovation pop through the cracks — and hopefully help some people, as well.
Back in November, Alexander Taub and Michael Schonfeld launched Upstream, a social media platform for professionals, to a small group of roughly 800 beta testers. The goal was to give folks a place to network and ask for introductions in a more digitally friendly, mobile-first platform than LinkedIn groups. The company counts Hunter Walk of Homebrew, Olivia Benjamin of Bain Capital Ventures and D’Arcy Coolican of Andreessen Horowitz as beta users. The plan was to launch publicly this summer. 
However, as companies have cut staff, the co-founders are launching Upstream to the public earlier than expected, with a specific goal to discuss layoffs from COVID-19. 
When the coronavirus hit, we were like, oh my god we’re gonna have crazy unemployment, Taub tells me. Its one thing to have a recession depression, but theres also going to be a zero demand curve because like, we cant go outside. So this is going to be bad.
As a result, Taub decided to double down on something he was already seeing happen organically on the platform: job hiring and role recommendations. 
Once a user signs up to the platform, they can join the COVID-19 group. They can then choose what they want to post: looking to hire; looking for a job; or looking to help. Being able to only originate these three types of posts, noted Taub, is part of the reason Upstream is different from a Slack group or LinkedIn.
Once a note is posted, users can directly message other users in the group to follow up on a job posting or warm intro. When I asked Taub how hes preparing for a potential uptick in usage, he said that if this blows upwe will put up a gate to limit the amount of posts that go live each minute. 
Other groups on the platform that are not yet open to the public include Jews in Tech, Business Development and Earlybirds. 
Taub said he and Schonfeld launched Upstream with a view to focus on individuals in tech. But in recent months, Taub says he’s noticed group members outside of tech have used it, including small business owners and teachers. 
There has been little innovation in support for layoffs. Most layoff solutions exist in the form of job searching groups on Facebook, communities on Slack and even a plain-old spreadsheet that includes a list of people to hire. Taub is betting that people want a dedicated place to be more vulnerable…because its a little uncomfortable asking for help on Facebook."

Across the European Union — a region with around 445M citizens —  it’s likely many millions of office workers will switch to teleworking, as countries impose quarantine measures and instruct people to work from home wherever possible. The European Commission itself, which employs around 32,000 people, moved all non-critical staff to remote work at the start of this week.
Yesterday Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the EU’s internal market who is also a former CEO of France Telecom, tweeted that he’d spoke to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to make the case for standard definition streaming by default during the COVID-19 public health crisis.
A spokesman for Breton told us the Commission is inviting streaming platforms to follow the lead of telecom providers and consider adapting the throughput of video streaming, such as by temporarily moving to SD rather than HD streaming — at least for the most critical working hours.
In Breton’s call with Netflix a number of potential measures were discussed — per the spokesman — including an automatic switch to standard definition during peaks of Internet activities on impacted geographies, which the Commission says represents a “responsible option”, that will help secure telecommunications infrastructures while “keeping offering the best service to users and consumers, with no disruption”.
Many content and application providers are already applying this sort of flexibility measure, it added.
The Commission is also asking telecoms operators that provide Internet services to take steps to prevent and mitigate the impacts of impending network congestion, by inviting them to make use of “possibilities” offered by EU net neutrality rules.
Earlier this week Vodafone reported a 50% surge in Internet traffic in some European countries as scores of people logged on from home. Covid-19 is already having a significant impact on our services and placing a greater demand on our network, the company said in a statement, adding that: We should expect this trend of data growth to continue.”
At the same time the Commission is calling for Internet users in the region to make responsible use of online recreational activities — such as by opting for settings that reduce data consumption, including using Wi-Fi (rather than mobile data) and choosing lower resolution for content whenever possible.
It wants joint action from all stakeholders to ease the pressure on infrastructure and facilitate remote working and online education at a time of region-wide public health crisis.
In a statement Breton added: Europe and the whole world are facing an unprecedented situation. Governments have taken measures to reduce social interactions to contain the spread of Covid-19, and to encourage remote working and online education. Streaming platforms, telecom operators and users, we all have a joint responsibility to take steps to ensure the smooth functioning of the Internet during the battle against the virus propagation.”
It’s not clear exactly what wiggle room the Commission envisages in EU net neutrality rules for prioritizing certain types of traffic over others during the coronavirus crisis.
We asked Breton’s spokesman for clarification on this point but he responded by emphasizing that the Commission is hoping to steer off such a scenario, telling us: “By calling for all stakeholders responsibility (platforms/telcos/users) we are proactively ensuring smooth functioning of the Internet so that the question of prioritization does not need to be asked.”
We also reached out to Netflix to ask what steps it’s taking to help manage bandwidth demand in the region. At the time of writing the company had not responded.
Breton’s spokesman said the commissioner is due to hold a follow-up call with Hastings in the coming days.
More broadly, the Commission is working on setting up a reporting mechanism to ensure regular monitoring of the Internet traffic situation in each Member State in order to be able to respond swiftly to capacity issues, liaising on this with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications and with the support of national regulatory authorities.
We’ve also contacted YouTube for comment on the Commission’s call for proactive action from streaming platforms to help manage increased demand on Internet infrastructure."

Knowing that, Twitter will take extra steps to remove tweets that put people at risk of contracting the novel coronavirus as it rapidly sweeps through communities around the globe.
On Wednesday, Twitter updated its safety policy to prohibit tweets that “could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19.” The new policy bans tweets denying expert guidance on the virus, encouraging “fake or ineffective treatments, preventions and diagnostic techniques” as well as tweets that mislead users by pretending to be from health authorities or experts.
Content that increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus, including:– Denial of expert guidance– Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques– Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities
— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) March 18, 2020
Given the new guidelines Twitter has outlined, the platform is going to have its work cut out for it. Under the ruleset, a tweet that claims “social distancing is not effective” would be subject to removal. Twitter will also require users to delete tweets telling followers to do ineffective or dangerous things like drinking bleach, even if the tweet is “made in jest” because that content can prove harmful when taken out of context.
Twitter has also banned tweets that make calls to action encouraging other users to behave in a way counter to what health authorities recommend, with the example tweet of “coronavirus is a fraud and not real – go out and patronize your local bar!!” Some political figures have faced criticism for similar statements in recent days, including Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) who encouraged Fox Business viewers “to just go out… go to your local pub.”
The rules will also ban tweets in which people play armchair doctor and make claims like “if you have a wet cough, its not coronavirus – but a dry cough is.” Users will also not be allowed to make coronavirus claims that single out groups of people based on race or nationality, like discouraging followers to eat at Chinese restaurants. Other race-based claims like John McAfee’s tweet that “Coronavirus cannot attack black people” won’t fly either.
Twitter’s new set of coronavirus-related misinformation rules is as thorough as it will be difficult to enforce. Many, many tweets would appear to fall under the deepened policy designed to prevent health misinformation from spreading on the social network.
To meet the unique challenge posed by the pandemic, Twitter said it has put a “content severity triage system” in place so that the most potentially damaging tweets can be identified and removed, with less emphasis on users flagging the tweets themselves. The company previously announced that it would be relying more heavily on automation and machine learning to act on content that violates platform rules, which Twitter admits may lead to mistakes in some cases.
In an effort to rise to the gravity of the situation, Twitter’s policies lay out an aggressive and fluid approach that we don’t always see from social networks. We’ll be following along to see how the platform experiment goes in the coming days and if Twitter can help stem the flow of potentially lethal misinformation as the world wakes up to the global threat of COVID-19."

Even the stories I write that are ostensibly not about the virus are always somehow about the virus. 
When we look back at this moment in time, the sheer ubiquity of the topic will, perhaps, be its defining characteristic. And while we flirt with notions of escapism, the fact of the matter is that well never fully get away from COVID-19 until it is completely eradicated.
Among the constant and mostly unwanted reminders in my own life is my work inbox. Im being pitched coronavirus-related stories dozens of times a day at this point, running the gamut from the tasteful and thoughtful to the cringe-inducing. In the early days of the outbreak, when I first began receiving these pitches, they all sort of felt as though they were being done in bad taste. 
Pitching against tragedy is not an uncommon practice in public relations. Like online content generators that juice SEO with trending buzzwords, the phenomenon is a common one amongst many PR reps. And frankly, by the time the realities of COVID-19 came to our shores, the isolated act of including references to the pandemic in a pitch no longer felt crass in the same way. COVID-19 is our reality now, and will be for a while. Perhaps it follows, then, that it will also bear mentions in the pitches that cross our inboxes. 
Im not an expert in communications or crisis management. And the extent of my work in PR was a few months fresh out of college, when I took a freelance writing gig to help keep my head above water in New York City. I hated it, and, frankly, I was probably extremely bad at it. 
While I know enough now to recognize a distasteful pitch when I see it, I was curious how people in the public relations industry navigate the question. I reached out to handful of reps Ive generally had a good experience with and asked how they best do their work when the world around them is falling apart at the seams."

This is the latest move from Twitter in what has been an ongoing effort to clear its platform of false information and the harmful spread of it as the pandemic increasingly takes its grip on the world.
The blue check mark was always intended to help steer people to know when they looking at more authentic voices or the official accounts for high-profile people or organizations, although it’s also been a huge vanity metric for many people, and so has often had a taint of the more ridiculous side of Twitter (the one where people also obsess over like and retweet counts). So harnessing it for a truly useful purpose is a great move.
It’s also one that is linking up with other efforts online: yesterday Google launched an updated search experience that includes a carousel of Twitter accounts Tweeting information related to the pandemic. This will help Twitter and Google populate that in a more informative and dynamic way.
If you are an expert who would like to use Twitter to broadcast more effective messages to the public, please read on. And if you are an authority who is not affiliated with one of the authorities working on fighting and managing the coronavirus outbreak, hold tight as Twitter said it will also be working on how to more quickly verify you, too.
Twitter said it is working with global health authorities — these include organizations like the WHO, the CDC, state health authorities and recognized academic institutions — to identify not just these organizations’ own accounts but those of experts affiliated with them. While it has it has “already Verified hundreds of accounts,” there are many more to verify, but the process is being slowed down by people not having all of their information in order. (Essentially these are some of the usual requirements for verification, applied specifically now to coronavirus experts.)
Specifically, Twitter said that experts needed to make sure that the email address that a person has associated with their Twitter account is their work emails. Instructions on how to do that here.
Then, Twitter said that a person’s bio needs to include references and a link to the place where they are working, and ideally that the page they are linking to also includes a reference back to the Twitter account (if it’s a link to a bio page). Instructions on how to update your profile here.
And accounts that are looking for verification, it goes without saying, have to follow the official Twitter Rules (which cover things like no harassment, impersonation accounts and so on), and specifically as it relates to coronavirus and Covid-19, Twitter’s guidance for that.
Twitter had, predictably, what looked like hundreds of responses to its Tweets on this subject, both from people simply saying, “Hey, what about me? Can I get verified today for my birthday?!” and those saying they also should be verified because of their authoritative position on Covid-19. Going about how to do the latter with accuracy will be a much bigger challenge that Twitter is still working out. “Were also considering a way to take public suggestions, but first are reviewing the suggestions we have from global public health authorities and partners,” it concluded."

Now, an app in the UK called the C-19 Covid Symptom Tracker, developed out of an unlikely corner of medical research — looking into the progression of medical conditions by tracking twins — is asking people to self-report their symptoms in an effort to start to gather more of that detail.
And in a mark of how the public is trying to step up its efforts to get involved in the fight to contain the disease, the app has itself gone viral, with 650,000 downloads since being launched on Tuesday morning.
Developed by a startup called Zoe in partnership with researchers at Kings College Hospital in London, the plan is to bring the app next to the US, where the latter group had already been working with colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford on a previous project (more on that below).
To be very clear, the app itself is not a diagnostic tool — these are being developed on a more national level, linking people through to local services. Nor is it designed to give the public any clarity on where Covid-19 symptoms are cropping up. (As we reported earlier, there are a number of those being built and used already, too, providing maps and other data.)
Instead, it’s a research app designed to bring together information that could be useful to medical professionals to better plan their responses.
At first, the plan was to build an app to figure out where there were clusters of cases in order to better determine where testing kits, in short supply, might be better allocated.
“We were actively speaking to a multitude of companies that are making or have testing kits, and the originally the idea was that if we identified people who were expressing symptoms, maybe we could get a testing kit to them faster,” said Sara Gordon, a spokesperson for the company. That proved to be too difficult, she added, since the testing arena is very fragmented and so it’s not clear whether they all reliably and consistently work the same (and work well).
Then, attention turned to where the data could be useful, and providing support to the NHS, the UK’s National Health Service, in determining the shape and evolution of the virus, in order to research it better and figure out how to deploy NHS resources, was where the team landed.
The ExCel conference center in the Docklands in East London is being set up as a field hospital now, “but there are many other places that will need hospitals opened,” she said, “and this could help figure out where.”
The app has a somewhat unlikely origin. It was created by Zoe, a spinout from Kings College Hospital that is now backed by some $27 million in funding — investors include Daphni in France, Accomplice (formerly Atlas Venture) in Boston, among others — in partnership with a research group at Kings College that has been tracking twins.
“Were a healthcare startup that has been running the worlds largest nutrition study,” Gordon said, spanning some 25 years (predating the startup materialising or getting spun out) and 8,000 groups of twins, and covering not just people through Kings, but also Stanford and Mass General.
Researching food intake as well as blood and stool samples, the idea was to “understand everything about how genes determine how we metabolise food, our immune responses, and more,” using twins with nearly identical DNA to do this, and using that input to determine new insights into cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions.
Last week, Zoe’s co-founder, Tim Spector, who is also Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kings College London and director of the Twins UK study, spoke to the Zoe team about creating an app to reach out to the 8,000 twins in the study (who had already been using Zoe to track other parts of their lifestyles) to see how many of them were expressing signs of the novel coronavirus. It could have been a useful test pool also for determining what role age plays in this, since the long-term study means many of the people involved are older.
Events overtook those plans, too:
“From the conversations we were having with Kings” — the inner-city hospital (which happens to be my local hospital) has been very much at the front lines of the coronavirus response in London and the UK — “we decided that if we’re making this available to twins, maybe we should open it up to more people,” Gordon said. “One of the main issues here in the UK and other countries has been that governments haven’t been able to get good enough data about where the virus is spreading or how bad symptoms are.”
There are some major caveats with the app, which it seems are still a work in progress.
The biggest of these is that the app itself is self-reporting. That means that you are putting a lot of trust into people to be accurate and also consistent with each other in how they are describing their symptoms. (Is my idea of a continuous, unproductive cough the same as yours? And are our coughs even a reliable enough indicator of what is going on?)
“Were relying on the public to be honest about their symptoms,” Gordon said more than once during my conversation with her. That would have been one reason too why tying the surveys to testing kits (the original idea) might have been problematic: so many people want some assurance that I’m guessing a lot would have reported just to get the kits.
The other is that it requires regular, habitual use: a person reporting one day is only really useful if that person reports for the rest of the days subsequent to that to get a picture of how and if symptoms progress. On the other hand, that could be a boost to self-reporting too: even if my version of a continuous cough is different from yours, at least I’ll now be showing how and if anything else gets added to that cough over time.
“What were trying to do is scale what we see and what scientists are classifying as severity of symptoms,” she said. “If someone has fever over a certain period, then thats logged as red. Amber is feeling ill.”
Over the next few days she said the team is hoping to separate Covid-19 symptoms apart from those associated with a common cold. “Were working to make sure that in reporting were being able to divide which are common cold or flu and which are Covid-19.”
A third issue is the data usage on the app. The privacy terms on Zoe note that the data is only there to be used by the researchers, but it also notes that it could travel outside of the EU not just for analytics but to be shared with other research partners.
“The data policy we have is the one we have had legal advice on,” Gordon said. “Its compliant with GDPR, and if if and when we pass to others, people’s names are anonymised and switched to code. We feel we have super strict data rules on our side.” She added that the compliance in the US is even more strict because any research we do there has to go through a clinical process to make sure it is protected “so there should be absolutely no concerns about data privacy.”
All the same, even with all the best intentions, there could also be a risk of your data getting misappropriated when handed off from one party to another and no longer under local jurisdictions.
One of the other co-founders, Jonathan Wolf, is the former chief product officer of Criteo (the adtech company currently being investigated by France’s data protection watchdog for how it uses personal data) is also something to consider, in particular when you see that Criteo is disingenuously described as a “machine learning company” in his bio on the Zoe site. If there is nothing to hide, why hide? (The third co-founder is George Hadjigeorgiou, who also doesn’t have any direct links to the medical industry, having been the CEO of HouseTrip and the co-founder of efood, a delivery startup.)
On a more positive note — and there is a lot to see that is positive here — Zoe itself is set up as a business, but this project specifically was built without any of that in mind.
“Building this to meet the current need was just a decision we made,” Gordon said. “The team switched from the commercial product to this for the next few weeks, and the plan is to make it open source and to hand it off to the right people eventually. We just want to get the ball rolling.”

It’s also specifically asking for help from the tech community, through an open call for contributions from individuals and organizations to help form its “COVID-19 Technology Swat Team.”
The call, posted to New York State’s official government website, seeks “impactful solutions and skilled tech employees” to help state authorities scale and grow their technology-driven response to the spread of the coronavirus. Specifically, New York state is seeking people who have professional experience in “product management, software development / engineering, hardware deployment &amp; end-user support, data science, operations management, design, or other similar areas.”
Priority is given to any groups or teams of individuals who come from the same institution, as the effort will include assigning teams tasks with minimum 90-day “deployment” periods, and the state is obviously looking to maximize effectively by sourcing talent that already works together as a collective, thereby bypassing the process of people having to figure out how to work together.
The application form also calls out full-scale platform builds as one area of contribution, as well as freely providing access to hardware or software that can be used in tech-focused solutions. It includes options for participating either with on-site staffing, or remotely, and it’s open to both groups and individuals despite the stated preference for pre-existing groups and teams.
New York faces the most serious threat from COVID-19 in the U.S., with a total of 30,811 positive cases reported as of Wednesday morning, with 12% of those in hospitals and 3% in ICU. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been calling for support in the form of equipment from the White House and federal stockpiles, but has also said that that equipment has not been forthcoming in anywhere near the volumes needed to address the situation in the state.
TechCrunch’s audience definitely fits the profile for New York’s new call-to-action for technical expertise, so if you think you can contribute in some way, definitely consider registering your interest via their task force website."

The company is launching a financial relief effort for those in the creative community who have been heavily impacted by the virus, which includes the addition of a public donations feature on its website. The company is also working to add a new feature that will allow artists to fundraise directly from their fans via their Spotify artist profile pages. Meanwhile, for listeners, Spotify is adding a COVID-19 news and information hub in its app to help keep users informed.
The new Spotify COVID-19 Music Relief Project will recommend verified organizations that are offering financial relief to those in the music community who are in need, worldwide. At launch, Spotify is partnering with MusiCares, PRS Foundation, and Help Musicians, and says it’s planning to add more partners in time.
The company says it will also match dollar-for-dollar the public donations made through the Spotify COVID-19 Music Relief page up to a total contribution of $10 million. Industry professionals in need of financial assistance will go to the partners’ sites for information to apply for relief funds.
“While streaming still gives artists a way to connect with their fans, so many other sources of revenue have been put on hold by this crisis,” notes the company on the Relief project’s page. “To play our part, were working with a growing list of organizations offering financial relief to creators around the world to find ways to support our community,” it says.
And though not yet launched, Spotify says it’s working to add a new fundraising feature for artists that will allow them to drive their fans to a fundraising destination of their own choice. This would allow artists to directly fundraise for other artists in need or another separate initiative of their own choosing. This feature will be optional for the artists to use and no changes to their profile pages will occur unless the artist wants to participate. And unlike the fundraising efforts on other sites, Spotify says it won’t take a cut of the funds.
Of course, offering personal fundraisers in a time of crisis can also be problematic, as there are a number of scammers now trying to capitalize on crisis with fake fundraisers. Artists, like anyone else, could fall for these scams and then rally their fans towards the cause — potentially redirecting money away from true relief organizations at a time when it’s critical.
This is worsened by the fact that personal fundraisers generally need vetting to ensure they in and of themselves aren’t scams or engaging in some kind of fraud. Even Facebook, operating at the scale it does, is warning users that it currently has fewer people on staff to review personal fundraisers due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. It says fundraisers may not even be able to be reviewed at all and if they are, they’ll take longer than usual. And yet Spotify is readily the rollout of fundraisers at this time when staffing reductions are in place? That’s concerning.
In addition, Spotify is adding a new feature to connect listeners with news and information about COVID-19. Through a new in-app hub, the company is pointing users to news and podcasts from the media, including ABC News, BBC World Service, CNN, Foreign Policy, and NPR.
And, like most companies, Spotify is also offering advertising space to governments and nonprofits for health information and PSAs.
The new COVID-19 Music Relief Project and COVID-19 hub are live today. Artists fundraisers are in the works."

A third of social media news consumers also reported that they weren’t sure about the vaccine availability.
Among people who get most of their news from social media, 57% reported that they had seen at least some COVID-19 information that “seemed completely made up.” For people who consume most of their news via print media, that number was 37%.
Most alarmingly, people who primarily get their news via social media perceived the threat of COVID-19 to be exaggerated. Of the social media news consumers surveyed, 45% answered that the media “greatly exaggerated the risks” posed by the novel coronavirus. Radio news consumers were close behind, with 44% believing the media greatly exaggerated the threat of the virus, while only 26% print consumersthose more likely to be paying for their newsbelieved the same.

The company announced today that it will provide “free or subsidized housing” for 100,000 people working as frontline healthcare, relief for first response professionals focused on stemming the COVID-19 crisis.
Airbnb’s effort will work by allowing Hosts on its platform to opt-in to making their space available, with any fees that Airbnb would normally charge for using its platform waived for those who participate. The program will include new protocols around cleanliness that are designed to keep spaces safe for those workers who use it, and Airbnb will be working with the Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee, the International Medical Corps and other non-profit groups to help allocated space where it’s needed most.
Already, Airbnb had been operating smaller scale programs in both Italy and France to address the crises there, with 6,000 hosts across both countries making their spaces available. This extended program was partly the result of many requests from hosts to the platform about how they could volunteer their spaces and help with the effort, and Airbnb will be making it possible for hosts to offer their spaces for free if they want though even those who still want to participate but keep a stay charge in place won’t be charged any fees by Airbnb itself.
The advanced cleaning protocols that Airbnb has put in place are developed to align with guidance from leading national health authorities, including the CDC in the U.S., and Airbnb says they will evolve as updated guidance becomes available. Some of the enhanced rules to help try to ensure safety include guidance that there should be a minimum of 72 hours between stays, as well as maintaining proper social distancing between hosts and any guests.
Airbnb also has a fund established for those who want to provide monetary support, with 100 percent of all proceeds going to nonprofits working on COVID-19 relief. These funds will help further subsidize housing costs for any responders in the case of hosts making housing available at a fee."

The tool is a GPU-accelerated genome analysis toolkit, which leveraged graphics processing power to take a process that previously took days, but that through its use can be accomplished in just a matter of hours.
Researchers will still need access to NVIDIA GPUs for running the Parabricks genetic sequencing suite, but they won’t have to pay anything for the privilege of running the software. This is a big advantage for anyone studying the new coronavirus or the patients who have contracted the illness. The GPU-maker is also providing links to different cloud-based GPU service providers to lower that barrier to entry, as well.
We’ve cut down drastically on genomic sequencing times in the past few years, but they still require a massive amount of computing hardware, and Parabricks, which was acquired by NVIDIA late last year, has developed technology that makes it possible to sequence an entire human genome in under an hour and that’s using a single server, not an entire server farm.
Speed is of the essence when it comes to every aspect of the continued effort to fight the spread of the virus, and the sever respiratory illness that it can cause. One of the biggest challenges that scientists and researchers working on building potential drug therapies and vaccines for the novel coronavirus face is lack of solid, reliable information. The more sequencing that can be done to understand, identify and verify characteristics of the genetic makeup of both the virus itself, and patients who contract it (both during and post-infection), the quicker everyone will be able to move on potential treatments and immunotherapies."

In a statement, the FAA says that that several technicians at the facility tested positive for COVID-19. For a while, there was a ground stop in effect for Midway and no flights could take off to land at the airport.
In its statement, FAA notes that the airport remains open and that operations will continue at a reduced rate.
“The air traffic system is a resilient system with multiple backups in place. This shift is a regular execution of a longstanding contingency plan to ensure continued operations. Each facility across the country has a similar plan that has been updated and tested in recent years,” the FAA says in a statement. How exactly the airport will operate without a working control tower is unclear, though. Smaller airports often revert to being uncontrolled fields after the tower closes at night and have procedures in place for this. That’s not typically the case for large airports like Midway, though, which are staffed 24/7.
The largest airline at Midway is Southwest Airlines, though Delta Air Lines also flies there.
In a separate statement, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the labor union for aviation safety professionals, asks that all who work at the tower should be tested for the disease. “NATCA is adamant that the testing must occur immediately and is hopeful there will be no additional COVID-19 infections. We are encouraged that the FAA is pursuing the rapid testing of all personnel at [Midway] Tower,” the organization writes."

The joint effort, confirmed Tuesday via a signed letter of intent, will see both partners work together on a a messenger RNA-based vaccine that will seek to prevent people from contracting the new coronavirus.
It’s worth a reminder that any vaccine is going to take, at minimum, between a year and 18 months to develop and certify for general. human use, so don’t think that this is going to result in any kind of short-term solution. But the collaboration does bring together one of the largest and most established players in the realm of pharmaceutical biotech, along with a younger company working at the forefront of mRNA-based immune therapies.
These therapies don’t use samples of the virus itself, as typical vaccines do (in either dead or weakened form, to jump-start the body’s natural defences). Instead, they rely on RNA to kickstart the production of proteins similar enough to the virus that they trigger the body’s development of antibodies effective against the actual target.
This collaboration should result in a clinical test that could kick off as early as April. Both parties aren’t starting from scratch in terms of their work on mRNA-based vaccines: they began working together on R&amp;D to create treatments for the flu starting in 2018.
While work on the collaborative effort begins immediately, across teams located in both the U.S. and German, the two partners still have to hammer out details including financial terms and commercialization of whatever results. The fact that they’re willing to begin working before the ink is dry on those details should give you some idea of the urgency felt behind the project.
This isn’t the only mRNA-based potential COVID-19 vaccine in development: Earlier this week, Moderna announced that they’d already begun human clinical trials of their own coronavirus immunotherapy, after fast-tracking its development in partnership with the National Institutes of Health."

The task force recommended people limit the size of gatherings to less than 10 people and that non-essential businesses close for at least the next 15 days, but hinted that this could last into July.

After the Federal Reserve cut its interest rates to near zero at the urging of the president, all of the indexes posted major losses and for the third time in the past two weeks, the Dow hit its emergency circuit breaker as the market opened; the S&amp;P also halted trades.
Even as equities fell, Trump tried to ease concerns noting that the government was committed to backing industries like the airlines and that the stock market would eventually rebound.

But a lot has changed since Super Tuesday. Lately, a lot changes every hour.
In a joint statement last Friday, top election officials from the four states with a primary scheduled on March 17 addressed concerns about COVID-19.
“Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” they wrote.
Three days after Ohio’s top election official reassured voters that the primaries would continue as planned, the state’s situation seemed to be in flux. On Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine supported an eleventh hour lawsuit to push the state’s primary back.
“We cannot tell people to stay inside, but also tell them to go out and vote,” DeWine argued on Twitter.
On Monday evening, a state judge rejected the request. Judge Richard Frye ruled that it was too late to make changes to the Ohio primary and that there was no assurance that the risk posed by the novel coronavirus could still be present months later.
“The doctors giving briefings in the national media suggest it could be months before we get to the point where there is stability,” Frye said of the decision.
While Gov. DeWine requested that the primary be pushed back to June, an attorney for the Ohio Democratic Party requested that it be moved to April 28, the same day as Connecticut, New York and other states in the Northeast. But as of Monday night, Ohio’s primary will continue as planned.
In a Facebook post over the weekend, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state’s top election official, reassured voters that Ohio’s 88 county election boards have been working with the CDC and the Ohio Department of Health on safety practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
“Voters should practice social distance in line, and though every effort is made to avoid it, some lines may be a bit longer, but none of this should discourage voters from participating,” LaRose said in a statement Sunday.
Ahead of its own Tuesday primary, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs issued some safety guidelines on Twitter.
In a statement, Hobbs said that the decision to continue with voting was “not made lightly” and that there might not be a safer time in the near future for voting to take place.
“My message to voters is, stay informed and make a decision that is right for you,” Hobbs said, mentioning curbside voting locations and drive-up ballot drop boxes.
On Twitter, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee encouraged residents to vote early and reassured residents that the state is “aware of voters’ concerns over #COVID19.” In an op-ed, Lee also noted that voters in assisted living facilities will be allowed to vote “without public exposure.”
In some states, polling locations have been relocated to mitigate the risks of the coronavirus. In any state voting Tuesday, primary voters are encouraged to double check their polling location before heading out to vote.

The country has ditched its centralized approach to COVID-19 tracking, based on Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), in favor of a “decentralized architecture” that only stores contact data on devices. this more closely resembles the approach Apple and Google will take when their beta tracing tools arrive in the next few days. It’s not clear when Germany’s app will be ready.
Contact tracing apps like COVIDSafe could prove vital to ending lockdowns by making it easier to track the spread (and hopefully, decline) of the virus as public life resumes. Rather than shutting down most of society, officials could limit closures and stay-home orders to specific businesses and people. The challenge is getting enough adoption for the apps to be effective. Australia, for instance, wants at least 40 percent of the population to enlist. That’s a massive amount for any app, and privacy reassurances might be crucial for reaching that target."

For instance, you might say, “Hey Google, play news about coronavirus in Boston.” Whatever Assistant-enabled device you’re using will then play a mix of stories relevant to your community. That should be useful for all news.
“The past few months have reinforced the critical role that local news plays in keeping communities informed. Google is dedicated to supporting and promoting local journalism both within and outside of our products,” Google said in a statement.

It’s too soon to say if this will prompt other high-profile departures, let alone any changes in Amazon’s operations. However, this clearly isn’t what the internet giant would hope for.

CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement that the company will spend $4 billion of its profits in this coming Q2 on COVID-related expenses. “Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we’d expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit,” he said. “But these aren’t normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on COVID-related expenses getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.” Such expenses include investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities, higher wages for its workers, and “less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing.”
“The current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon’s business as never before, but it’s also the hardest time we’ve ever faced,” said Bezos. 
Amazon has faced accusations recently of poor working conditions from warehouse workers, delivery personnel and Whole Foods employees. In a statement, Amazon responded to this by outlining several ways it’s helping its employees, such as procuring 100 million face masks and requiring them to be worn by all staff. It also said it has a team dedicated to increasing testing capacity -- it’s building its first lab and has already started to test front-line employees.
The company has taken steps recently to prioritize shipments of essential items, and in doing so, is also attempting to “protect customers from bad actors.” It has removed over one million offers so far due to COVID-based price gouging. It also suspended more than 10,000 accounts for violating their fair-pricing policies. 
Amazon has also faced criticisms lately for delivery delays and supply shortages from Prime Now, Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market.

In an attempt to promote adoption and avoid fragmentation, use of the API will be restricted to one app per country -- though there may be some exception if a country has opted for a state or regional approach. A handful of US states, including Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina, plan to use the API for their own apps.
While 22 countries have requested the API, that doesn’t mean they will all put it to use. The UK said it won’t use the Apple-Google model, and countries like Australia have already rolled out their own solutions. Still, Apple and Google expect more countries to request the API in the coming weeks, and the World Health Organization (WHO) said it will release a contact tracing app for countries that don’t make their own. The WHO may use the Apple-Google tech.
Technology can help health officials rapidly tell someone they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Today the Exposure Notification API we created with @Google is available to help public health agencies make their COVID-19 apps effective while protecting user privacy.
— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) May 20, 2020
On its end, Apple is adding exposure notification functionality to iOS 13.5, released today, so its devices should work with the API and iOS apps that use it. Google is rolling out a Play Services update today, so Android devices running 6.0 and above will be compatible.
As previously reported, PHAs that use the API must agree to only use the tech for COVID-19 contact tracing. Users must consent before the app uses the API and before they share a positive test result. Users can also turn exposure notifications on and off. Apps cannot request access to location data, and they are not permitted to use user data for things like targeted advertising.
The API will allow PHAs to define what constitutes an exposure event and determine transmission risk factors. For instance, a PHA may decide to send exposure notifications if you were exposed for several minutes (say, on public transit) but not if you were exposed for a few seconds (passing someone on the sidewalk). 
Despite safeguards put in place to protect user privacy -- all metadata associated with Bluetooth will be encrypted -- the API and contact tracing apps will likely raise privacy concerns. And yet, to be truly effective, they will need widespread adoption."

Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images
To get myself through the pandemic, Ive been summoning everything Ive learned about surviving in a new world as an immigrant. I left the Philippines as a kid to join my parents in California. Walang tiyaga, walang nilaga, my grandma used to say. Strictly translated, it means no perseverance, no stew. That lesson on weathering hardship recently took on new meaning.
Im not just worried about the virus. Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans are up, while President Trump continues to characterize the disease as foreign and Chinese. Some of my friends are worried about heading outside not only because of the virus, but because of the racist slurs hurled at them. 
Went to take out trash.Was talking on phone in Chinese. Man walked by on sidewalk &amp; in interest of social distancing,I said,""sorry, go ahead."" ""FUCKING CHINESE,""he yelled loud enough I could hear him over aide's voice on phone. I turned to look at him to make sure I heard right

Filipinos, like other immigrant groups, tend to be overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic. The Philippines sends more nurses abroad to staff the worlds health care systems than any other country in the world. Filipinos also make up a third of all cruise ship workers and, in China, are the largest group of migrant domestic workers. The service industry that delivers food to our doorsteps relies on immigrants, too. 
immigrants are overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic
Many of the neighborhoods where people of color and immigrants live have more air pollution, which can be deadly during outbreaks of a virus that affects the lungs. For instance, Latinos are over 51 percent more likely to live in counties with dangerous levels of smog than non-Hispanic whites. That can lead to chronic conditions such as asthma that make someone especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Pollution has also been linked to heart disease; people with serious heart conditions are also at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.
Theres more. Some immigrants are afraid to seek care because they are worried that they will endanger their own immigration status by doing so. Under a new rule, a person who uses public benefits like Medicaid can be denied a green card. This doesnt apply to permanent residents renewing their green cards, but misinformation is already stopping people from getting care. After pushback from Democrats, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it wouldnt penalize green card applicants for getting treatment or testing for COVID-19. ICE announced on the 18th that it wont carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities; advocates and doctors worried that the fear of getting swept up by ICE might keep people from getting care. But that might not matter if people are too afraid to see a doctor. 
With any disaster, some people are hit first and worst. There are parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental injustice, says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who led the EPAs efforts to address environmental racism and injustice under the Obama administration. In both crises, the people facing the greatest risk are often people of color, working class families, and the poor. More of our folks are going to die disproportionately, he says, meaning black, brown, and indigenous communities. The people calling the shots dont come from the places that are most affected so they often dont understand whats happening on the ground. They might even make decisions that make things worse.
More of our folks are going to die disproportionately
Now, the Trump administration is using the pandemic as an excuse to push hard-line immigration policies it would have pursued anyway, says Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. [Theyre] really taking advantage of this moment, even though its a questionable decision to pour resources into that, she says. Maybe we shouldnt be concentrating more on finding masks for doctors and nurses than we should be on kicking asylum seekers out of the country. 
Pierce thinks more people will lose their work authorization or violate their visas because US Citizenship and Immigration Services has shut down its offices and suspended in-person meetings that immigrants must attend to keep their legal status. That means more people could face deportation or detention in facilities that, like prisons, can become hotbeds for disease. While immigrant rights advocates are calling for detention centers to shut down, the Trump administration is using them to fearmonger. 
People in detention could pass the virus on to customs and border patrol officers, and even the United States population as a whole, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a March 20th briefing on the pandemic. Migrants in [detention] facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic, he added. That day, the administration announced it would begin to remove anyone crossing US borders illegally, including people seeking asylum, immediately without due process. 
Ive heard this crap my whole life: that immigrants take more than we give whether thats overburdening health care, snatching jobs, or whatever so lets send them away. Racism and xenophobia has always threatened my existence in this country. 
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics. Italian immigrants were scapegoats for the New York City polio epidemics in 1907 and 1916. Cholera was called Asiatic cholera in the 1800s and tuberculosis called the Jewish disease in the 1900s. Thousands of people died from AIDS before the Reagan administration began taking the epidemic seriously in the mid 1980s, after making callous jokes about the disease referred to as gay plague. 
With this new virus, something was triggered that is always latently there, under the surface, which is this fear of the other and the idea that bad things come from elsewhere, York University professor Roger Keil told The Verge in February. 
The virus is already spreading in the US; its useless to scapegoat migrants at our borders when we now have more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world. The Latin American country with the most cases of COVID-19 is Brazil, which had 2,433 cases on the 26th just over a tenth of the number of infections in New York City alone. It seems likelier that migrants in detention centers will get sick here. And deporting people who were infected in the US back to other countries means spreading the disease further. 
Shifting blame onto others does nothing to keep Americans, including myself, safe. Its a waste of energy when every moment matters in our response to the crisis. Ive watched New York Citys local officials plead daily for ventilators and federal assistance. As someone who calls this place home, this is terrifying. My mom and many of my aunties are nurses in the US; they need more masks and medical supplies to keep people healthy. 
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder, both Ali and Pierce told me. Another lesson Ive learned from my community is that the only way we beat the odds is when we show up for each other. My aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandmothers stepped in to take care of me in the Philippines until my parents were on solid footing and could send for me. Together, they got me here to where I am today. The only way to get through this crisis will be to do so together, too. My mom and aunties will take care of you when you get sick. Make sure to take care of them, too. Theyre immigrants, and well need them.

Grindr is at least up-front about the topic; even still, the hookup app has no info on the erotic quandaries of quarantine.
Tinder, for its part, has acknowledged the coronavirus. But rather than actually talk about hookups and viral loads, the dating app avoided the specific reason why it would say anything in the first place. ""While we want you to continue to have fun,"" its glib pop-up stated, ""protecting yourself from the Coronavirus is more important."" This was followed by a four-point ""wash your hands"" shortlist and a link to the World Health Organization.
Grindr serves 5 million users worldwide; Bumble has 22 million. Tinder counts 50 million members globally. Since sex and dating is a contact sport, you'd think that being able to tell 77 million people specific ways not to die while using their dating apps would be of the utmost urgency. Think about it: they have a unique chance to talk about what's really going on with quarantine quandaries and tech-enabled hookups.
But ew, sex. It's like they either forgot that dating's raison d'être is intimacy — or they're shoveling a bullshit pretense that their apps have nothing to do with sex.
Dating and hookup app users have adapted to COVID-19, even if prudish tech companies haven't. There's a surge in bios now looking for quarantine amor; cuddle pals and shut-in lovers, to ""ride it out,"" if you will. It's enough to make the ""wash your hands"" pop-ups look criminally negligent. Buzzfeed reported Tinder users saying they weren't that concerned about catching coronavirus, with one male saying he has ""no intention of letting it dictate my social life.""
I'll bet those 77 million people desperately want to know how ""social distancing"" applies to hand-holding. Or how to know if (or when) it's safe to kiss someone. Tinder's ""distancing"" caution specified ""public gatherings,"" but what about private gatherings?
That's tens of millions actively wondering right now: is novel coronavirus similar to other STDs? Like, even if you wore sexy rubber catsuits and kept your bits covered in latex, can anyone bang safely right now? Is this the AIDS epidemic all over again, where the desire for sex is reviled like having a death wish? What horrible future are we in now that all dating has become... teleconferencing?
More to the point, we have to wonder if coronavirus infections will spread because Big Tech is too scared to talk plainly and non-judgmentally about COVID-19, human desire, and sexual communication.
""If dating apps wanted to follow the protocols of the adult industry,"" explained Free Speech Coalition Communication Director Mike Stabile, ""they should realize that, in a public health crisis, they are a unique portal to the population and can be an effective way to communicate information.""
When the adult industry sees a potential risk to the performer pool, we shut down PASS — the performer testing system — to alert performers and producers that there is a production hold.
The adult industry has survived and thrived precisely because we do talk about sexual health and safety constantly. Society needs to learn to talk about sexual risk in a way that's not stigmatizing or accusatory, but as medical fact.
""Not everyone reads the news or is on social media,"" Stabile added. ""We all have our part to play.""
Can't swipe it away
Like everyone else, adult performers and other sex industry workers are concerned about coronavirus transmission risks. The Free Speech Coalition posted a porn-industry-specific COVID-19 advisory last week, describing new behaviors to adopt for coronavirus safety in a sexual atmosphere. ""In some ways, this is familiar territory for us,"" explained FSC's Stabile. ""Despite the intimate nature of our business, our sets are smaller and crew are already trained in safe handling of bodily fluids.""
If only the stewards of bazillion-dollar tech apps were as innovative and efficient as the sex industries they exclude and erase at every turn. ""The adult industry is used to talking about risk-mitigation, and already have an infrastructure set up with health and testing protocols,"" Stabile said, noting that all performers are notified en masse when there's a health risk to the population, and doesn't generalize about it in a quick pop-up linking to the WHO.
Bumble's upsell to its videoconference product, by comparison, was crass and a missed opportunity to say why safer coronavirus sex matters now more than ever. FSC told Engadget that ""some performers are already shifting toward more self-produced content, cams and solos."" And this is exactly how wider sex work communities are shifting as the business of sexual intimacy meets stark COVID-19 transmission concerns for both workers and their clients.
""On Tuesday,"" wrote an anonymous sex worker, ""politician Lord Bethell spoke in the House of Lords about the risk of transmitting coronavirus through kissing and other forms of social intercourse, saying: ""Kissing is wonderful but potentially dangerous."" As an in-person sex worker, this isn't good for business.""
Former full-service sex worker and author of the Thriving in Sex Work series Lola Davina told Engadget via email, ""Any time social distancing is the solution to a problem, contact sex workers, including strippers, masseuses/masseurs, professional dominants, and full service sex workers will be hit hard.""
Evolving faster than tech companies, online workers are stepping up to coach others to find new, non-contact ways to get the job(s) done. And while the Senate GOP blocked an emergency paid sick leave bill intended to deal with the fallout of coronavirus, the Sex Worker Aid Initiative of Seattle sprang into action and launched a ""COVID19 #MutualAid fund and emergency response for affected community members.""
Dating apps could learn a lot from sex workers about what to say to their 77 million scared and horny users -- all of whom are at risk now. Writer and performer Lorelei Lee offers cleaning details revealing that a BDSM dungeon is probably one of the lowest-risk locations you could find yourself in a pandemic. New York based escort fera lorde spelled it all out in an informative Twitter thread. ""We already use (sometimes medical grade) sanitation products for laundry, surfaces, doorknobs, toys, hands – you name it. I've never worked in an incall that didn't have a plethora of sanitation products and antibacterial soap/hand sanitizer on hand and stocked up...""
How I, A Sex Worker, Am Handling COVID19 - a thread!
I wanted to address this because clients are *blowing me up* about it - so here we go!
As SWs, we are *already* vigilant about our intimate work and keeping transmission risks to a minimum. Here are some steps many of us take
— fera lorde (@feralorde) March 10, 2020
Needless to say, coronavirus safety advice to 77 million people using your app to hook up is quite different than advice for going to Trader Joe's and panic buying all the frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken. Especially when you consider that the pandemic and quarantine is now projected to have a massive sexual impact on the general population.
A pandemic in your pants
This week, San Francisco AIDS Foundation posted a very detailed information page about steps to prevent novel coronavirus — far more on social distancing than Tinder's pop-up. UCSF posted really helpful notes from its expert panel on COVID-19, explicitly stating that routes of infection occur in three ways: ""Hand to mouth / face; Aerosol transmission; and, Fecal oral route.""
The Guttmacher Institute looked at the bigger picture, detailing expected outcomes of current response and our certain sexual doom in its COVID-19 outbreak post, Potential Fallout for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights.
""Unlike the Zika virus outbreak,"" Guttmacher wrote, ""where sexual and mother-to-infant transmission were well-established, much less is known today about these potential transmission routes for COVID-19."" That sounds to me like something every horny app user on Earth should know right now.
Further, Guttmacher detailed:
At the health system level, we may see shortages of medications—such as contraceptives, antiretrovirals for HIV/AIDS and antibiotics to treat STIs—due to disruptions in supply chains overall.
...health authorities have recommended that people stock up ... items like oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch and ring, condoms, spermicide and lubrication will be important items on that list. However, building that stockpile might be difficult because of supply shortages and insurance practices that often limit reimbursement to just one month of prescription drugs at a time.
So while some joke on social media about all the COVID-19 babies we'll be seeing in December, everyone else who works in sexual health is deeply, terribly worried about a certain spike in STDs and STIs. It's one thing if dating and hookup apps could let everyone know that kissing, and yes, banging, is a way you can become a vector to accidentally infect your grandma with coronavirus. But it seems equally urgent for Big Tech to tell thirsty users that most condoms are made in China, there are predicted birth control pill shortages, as well as meds to deal with sexually transmitted infections and diseases.
Also, lots of unwanted pregnancies. And there's a chance diseases like HIV could become lethal once again as the availability and access to PreP and antivirals dry up.
Plus, while Trader Joe's was getting its shelves wiped clean in San Francisco this week, I noticed that Bed Bath and Beyond was seeing its shelves of condoms diminish -- and that was Thursday.
Thirsty for the truth
As a trained sex crisis counselor (and a training speaker for sex-ed peers), the ways in which dating and hookup apps are worsening the coronavirus by being sex-phobic bystanders makes me want to scream, or fill the interior of a Bumble executive's Tesla with inferior lube, or set Home Alone style dildo traps throughout Tinder's offices. Something, anything, to make them wake the hell up. Talking about coronavirus and sex isn't going to kill business, but not talking about it certainly will kill someone.
Ultimately, sex and the pandemic is all about harm reduction. Know the risks: Specifically, how transmission occurs, and how that fits into what you'd like to do. Make the best decision for your individual situation that reduces as many risks as possible for you, your sexytime partner(s), and the people you care about.
One way you might reduce your risks is by not taking any — like worldwide sex party club Kinky Salon. This week the club notified its happy-go-pervy patrons that in-person events were on hold indefinitely. ""Let's face it,"" they wrote in a mass email, ""no amount of hand washing will work when we're all making out with each other!""
It's okay if you don't want to deal; it's perfectly okay to put your sex life on hold until this intense storm passes. Just make sure your idea of 'not dealing with it' doesn't include ignoring your risks (and how you might put others at risk) if you decide to get down.
The discussions of sex, dating, tech, and COVID-19 will continue for a long time to come. It's up to us to make sure they keep happening — especially when hookup and dating apps act like keeping users informed and alive is simply ""not their department.""

It's going to be pandemonium when they try to reinforce these rules.
If you happened to watch the president's second swing at addressing the coronavirus outbreak on Friday afternoon, I'm sorry but that's time you simply won't ever get back.

Yes, granted, the XBox One X will soon be obsolete but for roughly a third the cost of an upcoming PS5 you can land a current gen system and enough games to get you through the next few weeks of quarantine.
Even as people shut themselves away from the world, they've still gotta eat. And with cities like NYC forcibly reducing dine-in service by up to 50 percent, much of that demand will be handled by take-out and delivery services. GrubHub normally takes up to 30 percent of an order's total from the restaurant as a commission. However the company announced last week that it is temporarily suspending those charges until we get a handle on this outbreak.

To make more of the life saving devices, manufacturers are turning to new designs that are faster and more affordable to make -- and the super affordable Raspberry Pi computer boards have become a go-to component. Tom’s Hardware reports that The Raspberry Pi Foundation is ramping up production of its Pi Zero boards to help supply manufacturers with enough units to keep up with the high demand for ventilators. While the $5 Pi Zero is the company’s least powerful computer (it features a single core, 1.0 GHz CPU and 512 GB of RAM) it still has enough juice to control the relatively simple computing tasks of a ventilator.
Another reason Raspberry Pi boards are ideal for ventilators is the company’s ability to supply them quickly. Eben Upton, CEO and Founder of Raspberry Pi told Tom’s Hardwarethat, “Raspberry Pi ‘builds to stock’ rather than ‘building to order,’ so we generally have products either on-hand or in the pipeline with short lead times.” The company made 192,000 Pi Zero and Pi Zero W boards in the first quarter of 2020, but is aiming to produce 250,000 of them in the second quarter of the year. Upton said that, as far as he is aware, this is the first time Raspberry Pi boards are being used as medical device components."

Jacobs, who is a geriatrician by training and is now the chair of the Department of Medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, was worried about how her parents were coping during the pandemic. They live in a long-term care community, but they felt isolated and lonely. Over the phone, Jacobs couldnt tell how her mother, who has some cognitive decline, was feeling or if she was walking comfortably. The communication at a distance is very difficult, she says. You dont always get the whole picture with an older adult on the telephone. 
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
And, like so many other Americans in quarantine, her parents were running out of things to do. They seemed bored and somewhat depressed by the lack of stimulation, so further ways for them to interact was very important, says Jacobs.
The Covid-19 pandemic presents a doubly complicated situation for older people: Not only are they at higher risk of contracting the disease, and more likely to develop severe infections and die from it, but they are also the most likely to struggle withand suffer from the consequences of prevention strategies like social distancing. For people with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or severely reduced mobility, social-distancing guidelines can be impractical and nearly impossible to follow, making prevention and treatment even more complicated.
Seniors, especially those above age 80, have been hard hit by the virus. Thats in part because they often have comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, which make them more likely to be hospitalized. Doctors arent sure why those conditions make the effects of the virus worse, but both conditions are associated with greater expression of the ACE2 receptor, a protein on human cells that the coronavirus latches onto to start replicating.
Many older adults also have chronic, low-grade inflammation, a state called inflammaging, in which the body is unable to control the release of cytokines, small proteins that are supposed to help modulate the bodys immune response. This dysregulation could put seniors at great risk of cytokine storms, a condition reported in severe Covid-19 cases during which a patients immune system spins out of control and starts damaging healthy organs.
Seniors are also more vulnerable because of immunosenescence, a slow deterioration of the immune system that is a normal part of aging. When people are young, the immune system has a big reservoir of T-cells and B-cells ready to fight infections. These are called naive cells, meaning they havent encountered any bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens yet. When those naive cells encounter an infection, some of them learn to recognize that pathogen and become ready to fight it off if the body gets exposed to it again. As we age, we lose that reservoir of T-cells and B-cells, says Wayne McCormick, head of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Washington. Its hard for us to make new ones, although some people seem to retain that capacity better than others. That means the persons body may mount a less robust immune system response than it would have done when they were younger.
Immunosenescence also means that diseases present differently in seniors, which may make it difficult for their doctors or caretakers to recognize a Covid-19 infection. While many Covid-19 cases include fever, for example, in seniors the symptoms might also include confusion, delirium, sleepiness, or loss of appetite. That may be because the virus has reached important organs like the brain, kidneys, or digestive system. As one gets older, the virus can invade without being resisted as much, and then some really bad things begin to happen, says William Greenough, clinical chief of the ventilator rehabilitation unit at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Particularly in older people, were seeing clogging of blood vessels in the brain and kidneys."
16,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Maryn McKenna,Covid-19 Data in the US Is an ‘Information Catastrophe’,The order to reroute CDC hospitalization figures raised accuracy concerns. But that's just one of the problems with how the country collects health,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-data-in-the-us-is-an-information-catastrophe/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f1f4bc1993bc1efb30b16a0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_COVID_data_679379743.jpg",2020-07-30T11:00:00Z,"If you are lucky enough to work in a large health care system that has a sophisticated electronic medical record, then possibly you can push one button and have all the data flow up to NHSN, says Angela Vassallo, an epidemiologist who formerly worked at HHS and is now chief clinical adviser to the infection-prevention firm Covid Smart. But thats a rare experience. Most hospitals have an infection preventionist, usually an entire team, responsible for transferring that data by hand.
There lies the core problem. Despite big efforts back during the Obama administration to funnel all US health care data into one large-bore pipeline, what exists now resembles what youd find behind the walls of an old house: pipes going everywhere, patched at improbable angles, some of them leaky, and some of them dead ends. To take some examples from the coronavirus response: Covid-19 hospital admissions were measured by the NHSN (before HHS intervened), but cases coming to emergency departments were reported in a different database, and test results were reported first to local or state health departments, and then sent up to the CDC.
Covid-19 data in particular has been so messy that volunteer efforts have sprung up to fix it. These include the COVID Tracking Projectcompiled from multiple sources and currently the most comprehensive set of statistics, used by media organizations and apparently by the White Houseand Covid Exit Strategy, which uses data from the COVID Tracking Project and the CDC.
Last week, the American Public Health Association, the Johns Hopkins Center, and Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit led by former CDC director Tom Frieden, released a comprehensive report on Covid-19 data collection. Pulling no punches, they called the current situation an information catastrophe.
The US, they found, does not have national-, state-, county-, or city-level standards for Covid-19 data. Every state maintains some form of coronavirus dashboard (and some have several), but every dashboard is different; no two states present the same data categories, nor visualize them the same way. The data presented by states is inconsistent, incomplete, and inaccessible, the group found: Out of 15 key pieces of data that each state should be presentingthings such as new confirmed and probable cases, new tests performed, and percentage of tests that are positiveonly 38 percent of the indicators are reported in some way, with limitations, and 60 percent are not reported at all.
This is not the fault of the statesthere was no federal leadership, Frieden emphasized in an interview with WIRED. And this is legitimately difficult. But its not impossible. It just requires commitment.
But the problem of incomplete, messy data is older and deeper than this pandemic. Four scholars from the health-policy think tank the Commonwealth Fund called out the broader problem just last week in an essay in The New England Journal of Medicine, naming health data as one of four interlocking health care crises exposed by Covid-19. (The others were reliance on employer-provided health care, financial losses in rural and primary-care practices, and the effect of the pandemic on racial and ethinic minorities.)
There is no national public health information systemelectronic or otherwisethat enables authorities to identify regional variation in the demand for, and supply of, resources critical to managing Covid-19, they wrote. The fix they recommended: a national public health information system that would record diagnoses in real time, monitor the materials hospitals need, and link hospitals and outpatient care, state and local health departments, and laboratories and manufacturers to maintain real-time reporting on disease occurrence, preventive measures, and equipment production."
17,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",David H. Freedman,Prophet of Scientific Rigor—and a Covid Contrarian,John Ioannidis laid bare the foibles of medical science. Now medical science is returning the favor.,https://www.wired.com/story/prophet-of-scientific-rigor-and-a-covid-contrarian/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ea8acc41db1610008d53116/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Freedman-on-Ioannidis.jpg",2020-05-01T14:22:21Z,"Yes, that may be partly because we managed to get enough people to stay home quickly enough; and yes, it has taken heroic sacrifice and risk on the parts of front-line healthcare workers to keep the system functioning. But Ioannidis insists theres little evidence that hospitals couldnt now handle the surges that might come from relaxing stay-at-home policies, assuming people who go out take moderate protection measures such as masks and social distancing. If were not ready to stay locked up for a year or more, he argues, were just delaying the inevitable spread of the disease without doing much to change the death rate.
On the other side, he says, are the health costs of the lockup. If we prolong these measures too long, the premature deaths from that policy could be 100-fold larger than what we see with Covid-19 itself, Ioannidis told me. The fear of leaving home to go to a hospital is alone almost certainly leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths from heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
If I did a study and the results showed that in fact there wasnt really much bias in research, would I be willing to publish it?
John Ioannidis, Stanford University
Other epidemiologists assessment of Ioannidis claim, that staying at home will likely kill far more people than Covid-19, might best be summed up the way physics giant Wolfgang Pauli is said to have dismissed the lesser work of a colleague: Its not even wrong. To be promoted to wrong, the Ioannidis position would have to be based on data and analysis that scientists could argue over. Even allowing his 0.1 percent fatality rate for the diseasewhich most epidemiologists think is way too low, but not beyond-the-realm-of-possibility lowthere is almost no data to go on for the likely cost in human life of the lockdown. We know Covid-19 is killing tens of thousands of people, and that staying at home is slowing the spread; but we know virtually nothing about the number deaths caused by staying at home. As such, what Ioannidis is promoting simply isnt science, says Loren Lipworth, a Vanderbilt University epidemiologist. Its impossible to do that risk-benefit analysis, she says. Its just relying on anecdote and common sense. In other words, Ioannidis is pitting his gut against the collective data-driven wisdom and analysis of medicine and public health.
Its not that Ioannidis isnt asking the right questions. I watch CNN and CBS News every day, and Ive only seen the issue of unnecessary deaths due to the lockdown come up a few times, in the context of chronically-ill people having trouble getting treatment. But Ive watched hundreds of stories of individuals dying horribly from Covid-19, and of anti-stay-at-home protesters excoriated by experts. Thats how most Americans see this disease: through a terrifying filter of widespread death that only fools would leave home to risk.
If Ioannidis claims even slightly alter the conversation toward a more balanced, thoughtful view of what we really gain, and what we might lose, from the lockdown, then maybe its mission accomplished. If hes even partly right that were too biased toward staying at home, and the disease isnt as deadly as we thought, the resulting shift could ultimately save tens of thousands of lives.
A week ago, Ioannidis legacy in medical science seemed unassailable. Today, not so much. I saw it on the faces of those medical students. To them Ioannidis may always be the fringe scientist who pumped up a bad study that supported a crazy right-wing conspiracy theory in the middle of a massive health crisis. 
The prevailing take now is that Ioannidis has fallen prey to the very sorts of biases and distortions that he became revered for exposing in others. If thats what happened, it will be a twist that Ioannidis himself had prophesied to me ten years ago in Greece. If I did a study and the results showed that in fact there wasnt really much bias in research, would I be willing to publish it? he said then. That would create a real psychological conflict for me. Ioannidis was acknowledging that hes invested in showing that other scientists tend to get it wrong, and that he might end up being skeptical of data suggesting they are, in fact, getting it right.
Now Ioannidis claims about Covid-19 may be pulled by the gravity of his commitment to being the one who sees where everyone else went wrong. Theres a meta-meta-science lesson in there, too, and one weve sometimes seen before: Bias is so powerful a force in scientific research that even a grandmaster of research into bias can eventually trip over it.

It also nearly stranded me 5,000 miles from home.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-argentinas-strict-covid-19-lockdown-saved-lives/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e9a1da46eb7dc0008e893d7/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_Argentina_1218823667.jpg",2020-04-23T15:02:01Z,"Today, the country still has fewer than 3,000 confirmed cases. Its neighbor to the north, Brazil, which was slower to lock down, recently passed a total of 38,000. And here in the US, well, were adding that many new cases every day or two. If you just look at the numbers, most of Latin America appears to have staved off the runaway explosion of infections seen in nations like Italy, Spain, and the US. It is possible that the travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders did exactly what they were supposed to do.
But these numbers, as we know by now, rarely tell the whole story. The US is currently testing about 13,000 people out of every million, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project. And while thats far fewer than the number of tests epidemiologists say well need to get an accurate read on the true shape of the outbreak here, every Latin American country is lagging even further behind. Its like walking blindly through the woods, because the official number of cases isnt real, one doctor in Mexico told Bloomberg earlier this month.
At a World Health Organization press briefing Wednesday morning, officials highlighted the importance of getting testing labs operational and training teams of contact tracers in Central and South America. What we are seeing there is an increasing trend in terms of number of cases, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHOs Covid-19 technical lead. The social measures and stay-at-home orders are buying some time, but its important that we use that time wisely. The trajectory of this pandemic in every country depends on how each country reacts, regardless of income. In Central and South America, she said, the increasing case numbers are worrying, but for many countries, there still exists a window of opportunity to prevent massive outbreaks.
In the US, that window closed in the weeks before Covid-19 started killing New Yorkers at a grisly pace of one every three minutes.
Langsam, the health policy researcher in Buenos Aires, chalks this up to politics more than anything else. Like the US, Argentina has a federalist system of provinces under the control of governors from various parties. But unlike whats going on in the US, here every governor agreed that buying time through a quarantine was a good idea, says Langsam. In the US, some governors, in states like California and Oregon, locked down right away, while others delayed for the sake of their states economy.
While Argentina is not yet beset by a plague of anti-quarantine protests, people are getting restless. Across the country, schools and businesses have been shuttered. Unless theyre going out to buy groceries or seek medical attention, citizens have been forced to stay inside their homes. In some places, there are reports of police detaining any people violating these orders and putting them under house arrest.
More than 12 million people have applied for a government subsidy that works out to about $100 a month, or half the minimum wage in Argentina. But in Villa 31, Argentinas largest slum, people can no longer afford to isolate themselves inside. In other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, where an estimated 113 million people live in low-income barrios, riots have broken out between hungry residents and military police forces. Theres no chance a family of five living in a shantytown will be able to follow the quarantine, says Langsam.
Its these kinds of economic and social considerations he wishes the Argentine government had deliberated more seriously before going headlong into total lockdown. According to reports, President Fernandez and his Ministry of Health met with a committee of the nations top virologists, epidemiologists, and infectious disease doctors in early March. Those conversations influenced their decision to enact a string of escalating coronavirus-containing measures. Why couldnt we have also stood up expert committees on the economic impacts of these decisions? asks Langsam. That would have brought more balance to our response."
19,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Victoria Turk, WIRED UK",Should We Purposely Infect Healthy Volunteers With Covid-19?,Such studies could speed up the development of a vaccine—but would mean deliberately giving people a disease that could kill them.,https://www.wired.com/story/should-we-purposely-infect-healthy-volunteers-with-covid-19/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ed158902294e5ecad1d303f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_needle_161657475-(1).jpg",2020-05-31T14:00:00Z,"Most researchers, however, dont believe a human challenge study could directly replace a phase three trial. Because a human challenge study is smaller, it may not gather enough data on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine to satisfy regulators. The trial may not exactly mimic natural infection, and it will only give information on the response of young, healthy volunteers, who may not be representative of the broader population. I do think that they need to be run alongside phase three, it's not either-or, Weller says.
But a human challenge study could nevertheless speed up the vaccine testing process by giving an earlier indicator of whether a vaccine is effective or not. This could inform decisions on which trials to move forward with or which vaccines to start manufacturing at scale, weeding out non-effective candidates more quickly. Human challenge studies could also make it easier to test more vaccine candidatesthere are more than 100 currently in development for Covid-19so that researchers can choose the most promising ones, possibly resulting in an eventual vaccine that is more effective.
Besides speeding a vaccine up, human challenge studies could also gather other valuable research data, for example helping to elucidate how people are infected and how they gain immunity to the virus.
And they can be particularly useful where a regular phase three trial is difficult or impossible to conduct, for example if there is not enough natural infection going around to get good results. This may be the case with Covid-19: as many places currently have lockdown measures in place to prevent people from being exposed to the virus, it could be difficult to see how well a vaccine works, as both the vaccinated and control groups in a phase three trial could simply not come into contact with the virus. Ironically, if a country is doing well at containing the coronavirus, they may find it harder to test a vaccine.
For some, the urgency of the current pandemic, and the desire to speed up the search for a vaccine, means human challenge studies make a lot of sense. But at what cost? We know that Covid-19 can cause severe symptoms and even death, and we do not have an effective treatment (beyond some evidence for the antiviral drug remdesivir). 
Advocates of Covid-19 human challenge trials say that the risk to young, healthy people is minimal, and is justified when compared to the potential benefits of a faster vaccine. There are multiple reasons why, in this case, we should proceed with human challenge trials, says Nir Eyal, director of the Center of Population-Level Bioethics at Rutgers University, New Jersey and the lead author of the paper that inspired Morrison to start 1 Day Sooner.
Younger people are much less likely to die from Covid-19 than older people, although it is hard to put an exact number on the risk; some reports suggest that the rate of death for people under 30 is around 0.03 percent. Eyal compares this to donating a kidney, and argues that the risk posed to volunteers in a human challenge study for Covid-19 is therefore below the threshold of what would be considered unethical. Clearly, this research could be considered permissible, especially in light of its tremendous public health importance, he says.
But others disagree. I would say that existing standards would say that you can't do Covid-19 challenge studies, says Charles Weijer, a professor of bioethics and research ethics at Western University, Canada and a member of the WHOs working group for guidance on human challenge studies in Covid-19.
In 2016, Weijer co-authored a paper that stated human challenge studies in infectious diseases should be limited to self-limiting or easily treatable infections. (A self-limiting infection is one that gets better by itself.) As well as the risk of death, participants of human challenge studies could be at risk of experiencing other harmful effects of Covid-19, with reported symptoms including everything from headaches and breathlessness to blood clots, lung and kidney damage. We dont know why even some young, healthy people get worse symptoms than others and, given we only discovered the Sars-Cov-2 virus less than six months ago, we dont know much about the long-term effects."

The dramatic shift comes amid declining attendance over fears of the rapid spread of COVID-19. It also follows moves by a number of cities and states that have blocked large gatherings and all non-essential travel in order to encourage social distancing. The move was no doubt as much an attempt to protect public health as it is recognition that staying open simple isnt feasible at the moment.

Regal currently operates 549 theaters, comprising 7,211 screens spread out over 42 States, American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam and Saipan, according to its site. The company has not announced whether it has any plans to help compensate employees, nor how it will handle users with an Unlimited Pass. 
AMC last week announced its own reduced operations. We reached out to the company to see if it had any plans for a full shutdown amid all of the recent news. Well update when we hear something back. 
Movie studios, meanwhile, are reconsidering their approach for films set for a theatrical release. Notably, NBCUniversal announced that it would be releasing films like “The Hunt,” “The Invisible Man” and “Emma” through on-demand services, in addition to theaters."

The BBC reports that the emergency law was passed during an overnight sitting of the cabinet, bypassing parliamentary approval.
Israel also said it will step up testing substantially as part of its respond to the pandemic crisis.
In a statement posted to Facebook, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote: “We will dramatically increase the ability to locate and quarantine those who have been infected. Today, we started using digital technology to locate people who have been in contact with those stricken by the Corona. We will inform these people that they must go into quarantine for 14 days. These are expected to be large even very large numbers and we will announce this in the coming days. Going into quarantine will not be a recommendation but a requirement and we will enforce it without compromise. This is a critical step in slowing the spread of the epidemic.”
“I have instructed the Health Ministry to significantly increase the number of tests to 3,000 a day at least,” he added. “It is very likely that we will reach a higher figure, even up to 5,000 a day. To the best of my knowledge, relative to population, this is the highest number of tests in the world, even higher than South Korea. In South Korea, there are around 15,000 tests a day for a population five or six times larger than ours.”
On Monday an Israeli parliamentary subcommittee on intelligence and secret services discussed a government request to authorize Israel’s Shin Bet security service to assist in a national campaign to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus — but declined to vote on the request, arguing more time is needed to assess it.
Civil liberties campaigners have warned the move to monitor citizens’ movements sets a dangerous precedent.
Netanyahu's announcement that he intends to bypass parliamentary oversight and implement emergency regulations that authorize the Shin Bet to locate Corona patients actualizes this danger.

According to WHO data, Israel had 200 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of yesterday morning. Today the country’s health ministry reported cases had risen to 427.
Details of exactly how the tracking will work have not been released — but, per the BBC, the location data of people’s mobile devices will be collected from telcos by Israel’s domestic security agency and shared with health officials.
It also reports the health ministry will be involved in monitoring the location of infected people to ensure they are complying with quarantine rules — saying it can also send text messages to people who have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 to instruct them to self isolate.
In recent days Netanyahu has expressed frustration that Israel citizens have not been paying enough mind to calls to combat the spread of the virus via voluntary social distancing.
“This is not child’s play. This is not a vacation. This is a matter of life and death,” he wrote on Facebook. “There are many among you who still do not understand the magnitude of the danger. I see the crowds on the beaches, people having fun. They think this is a vacation.”
“According to the instructions that we issued yesterday, I ask you not leave your homes and stay inside as much as possible. At the moment, I say this as a recommendation. It is still not a directive but that can change,” he added.
Since the Israeli government’s intent behind the emergency mobile tracking powers is to combat the spread of COVID-19 by enabling state agencies to identify people whose movements need to be restricted to avoid them passing the virus to others, it seems likely law enforcement agencies will also be involved in enacting the measures.
That will mean citizens’ smartphones being not just a tool of mass surveillance but also a conduit for targeted containment — raising questions about the impact such intrusive measures might have on people’s willingness to carry mobile devices everywhere they go, even during a pandemic.
Yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that the US government is considering similar location-tracking technology measures in a bid to check the spread of COVID-19 — with discussions ongoing between tech giants, startups and White House officials on measures that could be taken to monitor the disease.
Last week the UK government also held a meeting with tech companies to ask for their help in combating the coronavirus. Per Wired some tech firms offered to share data with the state to help with contact tracing — although, at the time, the government was not pursuing a strategy of mass restrictions on public movement. It has since shifted position."

The groups, ACT for Alexandria, Arlington Community Foundation, Community Foundation for Northern Virginia and the Greater Washington Community Foundation, will each use a portion of the million dollars as flexible funds that will go towards food, housing and shelter, and emergency assistance.
Amazon only months ago received approval for its plans for HQ2 in Arlington County, Virginia, which is why it’s focusing its relief efforts on this area. It has also been preparing for the HQ expansion by hiring hundreds of workers, with the goal of hiring 1,000 by the end of this year and 25,000 by 2030.
The foundations receiving the donations from Amazon will focus on those who are most impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, including hourly workers, the homeless, and the elderly.
In addition, Amazon is providing cash and other support to five food banks in the D.C. area, including Capital Area Food Bank, DC Central Kitchen, Arlington Food Access Center, Marthas Table, and Central Union Mission. Martha’s Table will also use the donation to provide gift cards, diapers, wipes, baby formula, and cash directly to enrolled families. Central Union Mission will use the funds towards continuing to provide shelter, hot meals, and services to more than 170 people each night. And other groups will use the funds to support pop-up food distribution sites and pay their staff, who are typically volunteers, to ensure the operations may continue.
The donation is one of now several Amazon has made since the COVD-19 health crisis hit. It has also created a $5 million Neighborhood Small Business Relief Fund to help Seattle-area small businesses with the economic hardships they’re facing during the outbreak. And it’s contributed $1 million to a new Seattle Foundation fun for community members affected by COVID-19; it’s subsidized two months of rent on buildings Amazon owns; it announced a $25 million relief fund for its network of independent Amazon Flex drivers; it donated $50,000 worth of supplies to a temporary quarantine housing; and it’s continuing to pay hourly staff in its offices.
Amazon is one of the few businesses that’s growing amid the COVID-19 outbreak, as consumers are staying away from stores and shopping for household necessitates and groceries online. On Monday, Amazon said it would hire 100,000 more workers to help meet this surge in demand.
“The Washington, D.C. area is our new home, and we must rally together to support our neighbors during this difficult time for our region and around the world,” said Jay Carney, Amazon SVP, Global Corporate Affairs, in a statement shared today about the new D.C. area donation. “In addition to making sure our Amazon customers can get the essentials they need, we will support our community partners who are doing life-saving work. Amazon’s $1 million donation to these four community groups will provide fast, flexible support to those who need it most and encourage a wave of additional community donations during this unprecedented time.”"

Cuomo said that the state’s Department of Financial Services is requiring health insurers in the state to waive cost sharing associated with testing for the new coronavirus, COVID-19.
The initiative paves the way for low-cost emergency room, urgent care, and hospital visits for patients worried that they may have contracted the virus.
The Governor also said that New Yorkers receiving Medicaid coverage will not be expected to pay a co-pay for any testing related to the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The steps are designed to ensure that residents of the state won’t have to worry about cost as an obstacle for getting tested. Any tests that are being conducted at the State’s Wadsworth Lab are fully covered.
Cuomo’s administration also outlined other actions health insurers are either going to be required or advised to take — including informing New Yorkers of available benefits, offering telehealth medical advice and treatment, and preparing insurers to cover the costs of COVID-19 immunizations if a vaccine becomes available.
“We have the best health-care system in the world, and we are leveraging that system including our state-of-the-art Wadsworth testing lab to help contain any potential spread of the novel coronavirus in New York,” Governor Cuomo said, in a statement. “Containing this virus depends on us having the facts about who has it – and these measures will break down any barriers that could prevent New Yorkers from getting tested.”
The state’s initiative will prevent insurers from forcing cost-sharing on in-network provider office visits or urgent care visits, when the purpose is a test for the novel COVID-19 coronavirus. The initiative is also designed to ensure that New Yorkers receiving Medicaid coverage have their costs covered.
Employees who are in self-funded employer-based plans not regulated b ERISA statutes need to contact employers to see how the new regulations will effect them.
The State is also requiring insurers to devote resources to inform consumers of available benefits; provide and promote telehealth services; encourage and verify whether provider networks are adequately prepared to handle potential increases in demand for services including offering access to out-of-network services; covering the costs of immunizations if they become available; expand access to prescription drugs; and ensure proper emergency care."

The Vice President noted that the decision was made following unanimous recommendation from health officials. The President has made a decision to suspend all travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland, effective midnight Monday, EST, Pence announced, adding, Americans in the UK and Ireland can come home [] but they will be funneled through specific airports and processes.
Those are the usual caveats for the recent string of bans. In many cases, returning citizens have been subject to screenings to ensure that theyre not harboring the virus. The moves are intended to reflect the spread of the virus.

They have 80,000 cases but only 11 new cases and seven new deaths, immunologist Anthony Fauci said, following Pence. “Things have switched over from China now and that is what has switched over the travel restrictions. You will see a curve of how the coronavirus outbreak evolved…weve seen it already with China and were starting to see it with Korea.

YC is looking for companies that can be helpful, but at the same time it’s looking to invest in businesses that can remain viable post-crisis, the company says on its site.
For a startup to have an impact in time to address the current crisis, it will have to move faster than most people think is possible. This means the founders need to have domain expertise in the area; they also need to have a plan for how to have a significant impact globally in a short timeline. They also need to have a path to building a sustainable business after the crisis is over.

The Verily team detailed its progress in a new blog post, and CNBC reported last week that it has brought on 1,000 new volunteers from Google and other Alphabet companies to help increase its testing efforts and bring testing sites to new areas. In total, there are four testing sites in operation across California, which took two weeks to set up.
That’s a lot accomplished in not a lot of time, and Verily now wants to pass on the benefits of its experience and lessons learned. It put together guidelines and resources for anyone else looking to set up a community-based testing initiative (assuming they have access to qualified laboratories, testing supplies and healthcare professionals) and provided them for anyone to download.
The guide includes various documents, including workflows for everyone involved in the drive-through testing process, as well as the type of personal protective equipment needed, and how to organize and deploy on-site staff. There’s even full testing signage kits ready for download and printing.
These guide materials were created by Verily’s Project Baseline team, working in partnership with California’s Department of Public Health and other state governing and regulatory bodies, and they represent input from Stanford Medicine as well. Overall, the guide is intended as a way to help Verily spread the benefit of its experience, at a pace that it just can’t match via its own efforts to scale.
The company is definitely still looking to scale its own testing sites, however, and to launch new ones. This guide could help others make the most of its experience as it does so, though they’ll require a lot of access to specialized resources to replicate, even with the benefit of information shared by a team with first-hand knowledge of the challenges that mobile COVID-19 testing entails."

The partnership is an expansion of an existing agreement between BARDA and J&amp;J’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies division.
With the agreement, the company is setting a goal of providing a global supply of more than one billion doses of the vaccine, which J&amp;J expects to have in clinical trials by September 2020 at the latest. The first batches of the vaccine may be available for emergency use by early 2021, the company said.
BARDA’s partnership with J&amp;J encompasses research and development of potential antiviral treatments in addition to the work that’s being done to develop a vaccine for the disease. Those efforts include development work J&amp;J and BARDA are conducting with the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium.
J&amp;J said it had also committed to expanding its global manufacturing capacity, both in the U.S. and overseas. That additional production ability will help the company bring an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use, the company said.
Working with teams at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a part of the Harvard Medical School, Janssen Pharmaceuticals began its research into potential vaccine candidates back in January. Those candidates were tested at several academic institutions, the company said, which led to the identification of a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate — and two potential back-ups.
Last week, Moderna Health, another pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine, said that it could have an experimental treatment available to healthcare workers as soon as the fall.
The Moderna vaccine uses messenger RNA, rather than doses of the COVID-19 virus itself, to inoculate against the disease. The use of mRNA means that the inoculation doesn’t expose recipients to the disease itself, so they’re not at risk of contracting the disease.
Last Monday, Moderna made the vaccine available to volunteer participants as part of the company’s Phase 1 clinical trials conducted in Washington state."

The mayor said the test would be available for first responders. The goal, he said, was to test those first responders who are self-isolating but have yet to test positive for the virus.
The city of Detroit received the Abbott Labs tests today, April 1. They will be available for use within the next 24 hours, the mayor said.
This system from Abbott received emergency clearance for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its a lab-in-a-box that is roughly the size of a small kitchen appliance. The small size and rapid test results mean it can be deployed and utilized more quickly than other methods.
The City of Detroit is getting hit especially hard by the novel coronavirus. According to recent numbers, the counties around Detroit contain 81% of Michigans 7,615 coronavirus cases. More than 20% of the 2,500-strong police force is quarantined with suspected instances of COVID-19.
The significant number of cases in Detroit led the mayor to go outside of traditional channels to obtain the tests first.
As The Washington Post tells it, Mayor Mike Duggan secured the cellphone number of Miles White, the chairman and outgoing CEO of Abbot Labs, and woke him up Sunday morning to beg for the test. This early morning phone call netted the city five machines and 5,000 tests.
Today the company said in a tweet that its making the system available this week in an urgent care setting in the U.S. where the company already has instrumentation. Abbott Labs says it already holds the most significant molecular point-of-care footprint in the U.S., and is widely available across doctors offices, urgent care clinics, emergency rooms and other medical facilities.
Abbott expects it will be able to produce 5 million tests in April, split between the new rapid tests and traditional lab tests that received emergency authorization from the FDA on March 18."

The study, conducted by the Central Queensland University Australia (CQUniversity), in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, will employ data collected WHOOP’s hardware with hundreds of volunteers who have self-identified as having contracted COVID-19 to study changes in their respiratory behavior over time.
The data to be used for this study has been collected from WHOOP’s 3.0 hardware, which has also recently been validated by a University of Arizona external study conducted specifically to determine the accuracy of its measurement of respiratory rates during sleep, which the device uses to provide quality of sleep scores to its users. That study showed it to be among the most accurate measurement tools for respiratory rate short of invasive procedures, which is what has led researchers behind this new study to hypothesize that it could be valuable as a sort of early-warning system for detecting signs of abnormal respiratory behavior in COVID-19 patients before those symptoms are detectable by other means.
The WHOOP team says that the respiratory rate its hardware reports very rarely deviates from an established individual baseline, and that when it does so, it’s usually due to either one of two causes: environmental factors, like unusually high temperatures or significant differences in oxygen concentration, or something happening within the body, like a lower-respiratory tract infection.
COVID-19 is specifically a lower-respiratory tract infection, unlike the flue or the cold, which are upper-respiratory issues. That means there’s a strong correlation between rate changes due to lower-respiratory tract issues not accounted by environmental problems (which are relatively easy to cancel out) and instances of COVID-19. And since the WHOOP wearable is designed to look for deviations as a sign of distress, among the other sings it monitors, it could notice changes to respiratory rates relative to baselines before an individual becomes aware of any significant shortness of breath themselves.
This is a study, so at this point that’s just a hypothesis, and will need to be backed up by data. The team behind it says it should take around six weeks, and there are an “initial several hundred self-reported COVID-19 cases” already present in the app from which it will begin, with a target of enrolling at least 500 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results. There are also other investigations underway to see if wearables that monitor a user’s health and fitness can provide early warning systems for potential COVID-19 cases, including a study being conducted by UCSF using the Oura Ring.
Unlike with previous pandemics, the current coronavirus crisis comes at a time when we’re increasingly used to taking data-driven approaches to solving challenges, and when we also have a lot of self-quantifying health devices in circulation. Those could help us get a better grip on assessing the spread, as well as trends related to how it circulates and ebbs/grows within a population."

Among them is Palantir, a secretive government-friendly big data operation thats able to ingest vast amounts of information to visualize trends and track individualsuseful tasks as the spread of COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems and ravage economies.
In mid-March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Palantir was working with the CDC to model the potential spread of the virus. Forbes now reports that CDC staffers are now regularly using Palantirs web app to visualize the spread of the virus and to anticipate hospital needs. According to that report, Palantir is eschewing dealing with sensitive personally identifying information in its coronavirus efforts, instead providing analysis of anonymized hospital and healthcare data, lab results, and equipment supplies through a platform called Palantir Foundry.
In the U.K., Palantir is also providing the National Health Service (NHS) with COVID-19 data analysis through the company’s Foundry software. In a blog post that mentioned the partnership, the U.K. government that it will use Foundry which has been primarily developed in the UK to [enable] disparate data to be integrated, cleaned, and harmonised in order to develop the single source of truth that will support decision-making.
According to a new report from Bloomberg, Palantir is also pitching its analytics software to government officials in France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The company is apparently pitching both its Foundry software and a tool called Gotham, which is best-known for helping intelligence and law enforcement agencies track individuals, as in the case of the company’s work with ICE. Those two tools are being proposed to European health agencies as a blended solution that could help countries get a birds-eye view of the pandemic.
As interest in surveillance technologies ramps up to meet the mounting crisis, privacy advocates are already sounding the alarm. The Electronic Frontier Foundation cautioned that “governments around the world are demanding extraordinary new surveillance powers” to fight the virus and urges close scrutiny of new relationships between governments and private companies that arise out of the pandemic.
Among those relationships: Palantirs co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel is one of the Trump administrations most prominent allies in the tech world. His sometimes controversial projects and investments generally attract attention, Palantir included.
Likely aware of its reputation as the shadowy tech giant that helps to power ICEs deportation machine, Palantir is apparently acknowledging the privacy implications of its new work. In a statement provided to the Wall Street Journal, Palantirs privacy lead Courtney Bowman asserted that privacy and civil liberty must be taken as guiding concentrations in any data-driven COVID-19 response, not as afterthoughts.
While it appears to be taking on a new role with the U.S. COVID-19 response, Palantir has worked with the U.S. federal government on infectious health threats for years. In 2010, the CDC used Palantir to monitor an outbreak of cholera in Haiti.
Some of that work is very recent. In late January, Palantir signed a $3.6 million contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide software for PEPFAR, a long-running international HIV relief program."

Startup Forward, which debuted in 2016 and has since expanded its tech-focused primary care medical practice to locations in major cities across the U.S., is launching a new initiative called ‘Forward At Home’ that reflects those changes and adapts its care model accordingly.
Forward’s primary differentiator is its focus on what it terms a patient’s ‘baseline,’ which is established by an in-person visit they make when they join that employs a body scanner at a doctor’s office to take a number of readings and produce an interactive chart displayed on-screen in the doctor’s exam room. Forward founder and CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously led special projects at Google before building the health tech company, said that as the company has ramped its efforts to support patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, including through in-clinic and drive-through testing, it also wanted to address the ongoing need for care for non-COVID patients.
“If people aren’t leaving their homes, and frankly, you don’t really want them to leave their homes unless you need them to, you have to figure out how to do all that remotely,” Aoun said in an interview, referring to Forward’s comprehensive biometric data gathering process. “So we’ve we’ve implemented a bunch of different things as rapidly as possible. The first is, how do we collect some biometrics so we put together a kit that has a bunch of sensors in it that we actually mail to you. This includes an EKG, a connected thermometer, connected blood pressure cuff and a pulse oximeter.”
This approach provides a whole new level of remote care, over and above what’s typically defined as “telemedicine,” which generally amounts to little more than video calls with doctors, Aoun points out. Forward’s approach includes automated vitals monitoring for alerting a doctor if a patient needs intervention, and a patient has access to all their own data in the app as well. The Forward At Home product also take their exam room smart display and brings it to their mobile devices, presenting it for shared consultation between doctor and patient during viral visits, which are available 24/7 to Forward members.
At launch, the service also includes home visits to collect urine and blood samples, as an added measure designed specifically to help patients adhere to CDC and health agency guidelines around self-isolation while also getting a detailed and thorough level of care. Aoun says that this part of the offering doesn’t make sense at scale, and will likely revert to in-clinic visits once the COVID-19 crisis passes.
The rest of the model, though spurred into deployment because of the coronavirus conditions, and the need to limit the number of people going in to medical facilities and hospital all across the country unless they absolutely need to, is here to stay, however. Aoun says that Forward’s goal has always been to address the need for tech-friendly, advanced and comprehensive primary care for everyone, but that it took an approach similar to Tesla’s by addressing the top end of the market first in order to be able to fund development of more broadly available services later on.
Meanwhile, the need to shift as much care as possible to in-home is pressing, and evidence from countries around the world is increasingly pointing to how important that is to stopping the spread.
“The big thing to flatten the curve, the whole point of it, is that the hospitals are going to be overrun,” Aoun said. “So you want to take as many cases as you can, where they don’t actually have to be in the ICU, and treat them outside of the ICU that’s your first principle. Then your second principle is, and China kind of discovered this early […] they started moving to getting people out of the hospitals, as much as possible for a second reason, which is not that the hospitals are overloaded, but that the hospitals are one of the fastest ways to spread COVID-19.”
That’s a perspective also supported by lessons shared from Italian medical professionals in their effort to deal with the COVID-19 situation there, which has essentially decimated large parts of their medical facility infrastructure.
Forward is also still continuing the other work it’s doing to address COVID-19 needs, including providing its risk assessment screening tool to all, as well as offering testing via clinics and drive-throughs to members, as well as mental health support. It’s also looking to expand its drive-through testing to new sites across the U.S. The Forward At Home initiative, meanwhile, will help ensure that clients who have other pressing health needs aren’t left behind while the effort to combat COVID-19 continues."

Inovio plans to inject its first volunteer test subject with the INO-4800 DNA vaccine candidate it has developed, following promising results from preclinical studies performed on animals that did indicate increased immune response.
The Inovio DNA vaccine candidate works by injecting a specifically engineered plasmid (a small, independent genetic structure) into a patient so that their cells can produce a desired, targeted antibody to fight off a specific infection. DNA vaccines, while available and approved for a variety of animal infections in veterinary medicine, have not yet been approved for human use.
That said, Inovio’s work isn’t starting from scratch: The company previously completed a Phase 1 study for a DNA vaccine candidate for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), where it showed promising results and a high level of antibodies produced in subjects that persisted for an extended period of time.
Inovio has been able to scale up quickly, developing and producing “thousands of doses” of INO-4800 in just a few short weeks in order to support its Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. The company has done so in part thanks to backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as funding from other non-profits and organizations. If clinical trials are succeeding, Inovio says that it will be able to have up to one million doses of the vaccine ready by end of year, for use both in additional trials and for potential emergency use pending authorization.
This is the second vaccine to undertake Phase 1 clinical testing on human subjects: Moderna began its trial in mid-March. Inovio’s trial will be made up of 40 volunteers, all health adults selected via screening conducted at either Philadelphia’s Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City. It’ll span the next several weeks, and the company expects data around the immune responses from test subjects as well as info pertaining to the safety of the treatment for humans, to be available by late this summer.
Any broad clearance or approval for use is still likely at least a year to 18 months away, but the pace with which human trials are beginning is already still exceptional, so hopefully we won’t have to wait too much longer than that."

Hospitals and other health centers will be able to apply for up to $1M to cover the cost of new devices, services, and personnel.
The unprecedented $2 trillion CARES Act includes heavy spending on all kinds of things, from direct payments to out-of-work citizens to bailouts for airlines and other big businesses. Among the many, many funding items was a $200M earmark for the FCC with which it was instructed to improve and subsidize telehealth services around the country.
Telehealth comprises many services, from something as simple as making appointments online, to using internet-connected monitoring devices, to conducting an entire primary care visit via video chat. The latter is an incredibly important option for doctors and nurses who not only need to avoid direct contact with potentially sick patients if possible, but also need every spare minute they can muster.
“The toll this pandemic is taking on our healthcare system is clear. To the extent that connectivity solutions can provide immediate assistance with remote care and monitoring, we should use them. There is already evidence across the country that this works,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement accompanying the order.
Unfortunately telehealth systems are by no means simple or easy to implement, given that they must not only meet highly stringent privacy requirements like HIPAA, but also be effortless to use for people who might not use video chat for any other purpose. Setting aside space, equipment, budget, and so on for telehealth operations is difficult and time-consuming in the best of times, let alone when care centers are overwhelmed and understaffed. Even hospitals that provide some telehealth services are likely to find demand far outstripping supply right now.
The $200M FCC program is aimed at mitigating this as simply and quickly as possible. “I’m hard-pressed these days to think of any better use case for the agency’s mission of advancing connectivity than telemedicine,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement.
As the order, passed unanimously today, describes it:
The support provided through the COVID-19 Telehealth Program wil help eligible health care providers purchase telecommunications services, information services, and devices necessary to provide critical connected care services, whether for treatment of coronavirus or other health conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Eligible” in this case means on the following list of types of organizations or combinations thereof:
<ul><li>Medical schools and teaching hospitals</li><li>Community health centers and migrant care centers</li><li>Local health agencies and departments</li><li>Community mental health centers</li><li>Not-for-profit hospitals</li><li>Rural health clinics</li><li>Skilled nursing facilities (e.g. long term care facilities)</li></ul>Any given entity may be awarded up to $1M in funding depending on its need and reach. Priority is being given to areas especially hard-hit by the virus and chronically underfunded places like clinics in poor neighborhoods that subsist on Medicare payments and the like.
There are a few restrictions as to what the funds can be used for for instance, only internet-connected monitoring devices are covered, not ordinary “offline” ones that the patient must relay the results from via other services. But the general idea is to stay flexible and let the recipients of this money decide what to do with it.
Rosenworcel tempered her hopeful remarks with some practical feedback for the order, which was by necessity somewhat rushed.
“This is a well-intended effort, but it lacks clear performance metrics,” she said. “That means it will disburse funds without a system for measuring outcomes or a plan for what comes after this pilot program reaches its end. Moreover, it does not focus on a specific problem in healthcare.”
Better, of course, that the money is available now and accounted for later, since we are presently in the throes of the crisis.
A second $100M program was also authorized, by which money taken from the FCC’s main budget takes a longer-term approach to engendering telehealth over the next two years. That program differs in some key ways (not covering connected devices, for one) and will play out in slower fashion but provide ongoing support.
The FCC has several ongoing efforts to “Keep Americans Connected,” as it puts it, from institutional programs like this one to extracting promises from broadband providers not to fine people for data overages or late payments. You can find a list of its work here."

Now, the company announced that it has received $14.5 million in funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to speed the development of one of its treatment candidates.
Emergent BioSolutions has been working to develop two different kinds of plasma-based treatments for use in treating patients who have already contracted the coronavirus and subsequently the COVID-19 respiratory disease that it leads to. The company is developing one treatment based on horse-derived plasma, which has benefits in terms of being able to be produced in large volumes, and human-derived plasma, which is less likely to trigger a negative immune response in patients.
In both cases, the strategy is based on the concept of using convalescent plasma as a way to develop ‘hyperimmune’ treatment products that can boost the immune response of a target patient. It’s similar to other potential uses of convalescent plasma being investigated by researchers and health organizations, but unlike a direct transfusion approach, Emergent is looking to essentially stack the deck by creating a plasma-based solution that contains many different kinds of antibodies to fight off the virus, in set amounts to produce predictably effective results.
The pharmatech company had already been working to develop both these solutions, and was working to expedite their development, validation and testing by leveraging prior experience bringing similar treatments to market. Now, however, it’s getting an additional $14.5 million form BARDA, which is earmarked specifically for accelerating the development of the human-plasma based program. The plan is to develop it using donations from patients who have already recovered from COVID-19, and already the company has begun screening and collection efforts to get that donated blood.
Next, Emergent BioSolutions’ test candidate will be included in a clinical study with the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, which the agency is preparing for the purposes of assessing potential treatments."

The series, which will begin airing on Instagram Live tomorrow at 7 PM PT, features the stars of some of Netflix’s top Young Adult shows and movies, including “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” “The Kissing Booth,” “Stranger Things,” “Cheer,” and “13 Reasons Why.”
The series will run every Thursday from now through May 14 on the @Netflix Instagram account, and will discuss the sort of challenges that young people are facing during the health crisis.
For example, it will touch on topics like “what helps if youre having trouble sleeping?,” “how do you stay connected during social distancing?,”  “how do we manage anxiety?,” and “what self-care actually means.”
Participating in the effort are stars including Noah Centineo (To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before), Joey King (The Kissing Booth), Ross Butler (13 Reasons Why), Caleb McLaughlin (Stranger Things), Lana Condor (To All the Boys Ive Loved Before), Jerry Harris (Cheer), and Alisha Boe (13 Reasons Why).
The stars will be talking with trusted mental health experts from partner organizations including National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Mental Health America, The Trevor Project, Crisis Text Line and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
The debut episode on Thursday, April 9 at 4:00 PM ET/7:00 PM PT will be with Noah Centineo from “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” who will talk with Dr. Ken Duckworth, Chief Medical Officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) on the topic of self-care.
While Netflix is no stranger to marketing on Instagram, this new live series is less about promoting Netflix’s shows and more about leveraging the existing stars’ power to do some good.
Young people have had their lives upended by the pandemic at a time when their social connections with friends can outweigh those of others, including family members. It has also disrupted major milestones that signify the end of childhood and the stepping into adulthood, like prom and graduation. In other words, the types of struggles young people face when coping with COVID-19 are different from those of adults, who are more concerned about things like job security, getting the bills paid, and their family’s health.
Netflix has released a trailer for the series today that explains the concept and introduces the stars. The company says it will share more details about upcoming episodes on Instagram throughout the month."

Investors seemed heartened by comments made by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who said Wednesday that the U.S. death count from COVID-19 is lower than initially modeled thanks. He warned that the death count will continue to climb even as new cases slow.
The action Wednesday followed rallies earlier this week. Still, it should be noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed below yesterday’s high of 23,537.44, suggesting that this could be a bear market run.
Here’s the breakdown at closing:
<ul><li>Dow Jones rose 3.44%, or 779.71 points, to close at 23,433.57</li><li>S&amp;P 500 increased 3.41%, or 90.57, to close at 2,749.98</li><li>NASDAQ popped 2.58%, or 203.64 points, to close at 8,090.90</li></ul>Equities were also buoyed by oil prices and news that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose policies fueled concerns about higher taxes, was dropping out of the race.
The transportation saw a bump today. Uber rose 4.66% to close at $26.94. That’s still more than 34.7% below this year’s high of $41.27 reached in February. Meanwhile, Lyft also saw shares rise 7.78% to close at $29.64. Again, it’s the same story as Uber. Lyft’s share price is still off about 45% from the year-to-date highs.
Among today’s leaders were airlines, which have been one of the harder hit industries in this COVID-19 era. United led the pack with a 12.38% bump to close at $27.51, followed by American Airlines and Delta, which rose 109.% and 4.4% respectively.

Investors have been warning that typically loss-making, early-stage startups are at risk of collapse amid the coronavirus crisis. But the moves come far later than generous packages put together by Continental European governments to support their startup sectors.
Ministers understood to be keen to support the strong UK startup and innovation sector and options allegedly being considered include convertible loans, which could either be later repaid or turned into equity stakes owned by the state. This would require matched co-investment with VCs, ensuring only existing venture-backed startups would be eligible.
The FT reports that ministers want to do this on a case-by-case basis and only after companies have first sought fresh capital from private investors.
Also being considered is additional grant funding via InnovateUK, a government body providing support to innovative businesses, and an expansion of R&amp;D tax credits.
However, the scale of any government intervention is expected to be far more modest than the governments previously announced support for small, medium and large companies and their workers, given investors are normally deep-pocketed and tech startups typically employ far fewer people than traditional industries. By contrast, the French and German governments committed 4bn and 2bn in relief for their respective tech startup sectors.
The proposals under consideration include ones put forward by a number of significant players in the UK tech industry, who jointly launched a campaign over the weekend to pressure the government into creating a support package to aid startups struggling to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.
The move comes in the wake of moves by other European countries, such as France and Germany, which have announced significant initiatives.
The Save Our Startups (SOS) campaign published an open letter to British prime minister Boris Johnson warning the country could lose a generation of startups and high growth businesses to COVID-19.
It claims more than 30,000 startups employing some 330,000 people do not qualify for existing support measures and are therefore in jeopardy if new policies are not developed to help them.
The campaign was launched by crowdfunding platform Crowdcube and industry body Coadec, and is supported by leading tech figures including Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Lastminute.com; Alex Chesterman, the cofounder of Zoopla, LoveFilm and Cazoo; and Arnaud Massenet, cofounder of Net-a-Porter.
It is also joined by organizations including The Entrepreneurs Network, Draper Esprit, Virgin Startups, Vala Capital, Innovate Finance, UK Business Angels Association (UKBAA), EISA, Tech London Advocates, Capital Enterprise and Seedrs .
Jeff Lynn, executive chairman and co-founder of Seedrs, who was a signatory to the letter, commented: The growth of the startup ecosystem has been one of the great successes of the UK economy over the past decade. All that work is now threatened by COVID-19, and that’s why it is essential that the government step in to help at this precarious time–just as the French and German governments are doing. The Save Our Startups campaign sets out three sensible and crucial requests that will make all the difference in ensuring that our startups can continue to be European and world leaders in the decade ahead. I am very pleased that Seedrs and Coadec, both of which I co-founded and chair, are Founding Partners of the campaign, and I hope everyone in the ecosystem will sign onto it.”
The open letter said: These businesses are making a huge contribution to the economy but are often yet to make a profit because they are investing in their people, technology and bringing innovative products and services to market. They are highly unlikely to qualify for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), which was introduced to provide financial support for SMEs during this pandemic.”
The letter points out that the French and German Governments have already worked to craft support for startups.
Save Our Startups has a three-point proposal for the government, calling on it to:
 Provide an equity-based liquidity package suitable to save startups at risk. While CBILS covers a proportion of UK businesses, the majority of startups and high-growth companies will be excluded and as a result, unsupported.
 Fast track payments to startups from public funding schemes – in particular, R&amp;D tax credits and Innovate UK funding grants. Private sector liquidity has taken a major hit during the crisis with angels and micro-funds unable to provide startups and high growth businesses with bridging money.
 Change EIS, SEIS and VCTs to stimulate private equity investment into startup and high growth businesses, since many startups are losing access to debt or equity support.
However, some investors are cool on the idea, pointing out that the government could end up owning stakes in companies that would not otherwise have raised private-sector money, and that there should be a natural falling-off of weaker companies at a time of public crisis.
Investor Robin Klein of Localglobe commented on Twitter that: “The UK Govt has done an incredible job supporting the startup ecosystem” but he called the SOS campaign a “knee jerk” reaction and although he was “100% in favour of rapid BBB and other govt support” this would be through established tools.”
The UK Govt has done an incredible job supporting the startup ecosystem: EIS, BBB, InnovateUK, R&amp;D tax credits. 8 out of 10 startups won't reach Series A. Please don't 'knee jerk' react to the call to 'save our startups' by deploying much needed Tax payers ££ directly.
— Robin Klein (@robinklein) April 5, 2020
Luke Lang, cofounder of Crowdcube, which initiated the campaign with Coadec, commented: Other European countries have raced to rescue its startup and tech communities, with French and German Governments committing 6bn in funding. The UK is sluggish by comparison, and further delays are unforgivable and threaten thousands of promising startup and high-growth businesses with huge potential.

The cuts impact about 8% of the staff, with affecting roles ranging from office managers, recruiters, and sales. Co-founder Michele Romanow says the company will use its connections to assist those affected by the layoffs to search for other work, and offer extended benefits through the end of the financial quarter.
Clearbanc has been noisy in its journey toward being a venture capital alternative for startups. Just last week, Clearbanc announced a new financing product to help startups avoid cutting staff and stay operationally afloat: Clearbanc Runway. And last year, it pushed out its “20-minute term sheet” to sell equity-free capital with a promise of founder friendliness. The model has seen the startup disburse $1 billion to nearly 2,200 companies so far, per its accounting.
In July 2019, the fintech company raised a $250 million fund and $50 million in equity to broaden its investment goals. The co-founders say Clearbanc is continuing to see an increased demand for its capital. It hired more than 140 people last year alone.
Clearbanc is in a somewhat unique position during this downturn, since it largely funds e-commerce businesses that have seen an uptick in usage as brick-and-mortar stores becomes less of an option due to social distancing.
However, last week, co-founder Andrew D’Souza pointed to unpredictable market conditions: “theres a lot of volatility and a lot of uncertainty,” he said.
Were certainly going to be more conservative than we would have been six months ago. It probably looks like us writing smaller checks, more frequently,” he told TechCrunch last week.
Today’s layoffs, according to the company, don’t directly impact Clearbanc’s ability to cut checks. Instead, Clearbanc cuts signal that layoffs aren’t reserved for the time when the dry powder runs out. As the pandemic draws out, we’re learning that sometimes it’s a bit more pre-emptive than that.
A storm of layoffs have impacted a wide range of startups and industries across the world. While travel and hospitality companies have felt the blunt of the pandemic’s economic impact, broader cuts show that sales and recruiting teams from other industries are also vulnerable. Layoffs been so ubiquitous that platforms have risen to help those laid off find their next gig. And in a time where uncertainty rules the week to week, any effort to create a meeting grounds for those with this tough shared experience is much welcome."

Southeast Asia’s foreign ministers have joined hands with China and declared their intention to “stay strong!”
Yet their hastily called meeting in secretive, socialist Laos last week suggests not so much resiliency as the need to shore up mutual support. Health experts are widely skeptical of the numbers reported by China’s neighbors, and believe the deadly infection is spreading undetected throughout much of Southeast Asia.
With infection clusters increasingly sprouting outside the mainland, where the virus originated, many fear these pockets—rooted out or not—are sustaining the outbreak and pushing the world toward a global pandemic.
The disease, officially COVID-19, has sickened over 83,000 and killed more than 2,850, primarily in China. But cases have spread to more than four dozen countries, and been identified as far away as Brazil and Finland.
Strangely absent from the list are Myanmar and Laos, which border China, as well as Brunei, East Timor, and Indonesia—of which the latter had daily, direct flights to the virus epicenter, Wuhan. Every other country in the region, all beneficiaries of Chinese aid, investment and tourism, has reported cases.
“The transmission dynamics of this virus are like the flu. It’s very, very difficult to stop,” says Richard Coker, a Bangkok-based professor emeritus of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
At the beginning of the outbreak, several of these governments downplayed the severity of the threat, publicly voicing their wariness of offending the superpower upon whom their economies rely. In lieu of public health precautions or stringent defenses, they offered folk remedies—suggesting everything from consuming onions or alcohol to working less to ward off coronavirus.
“Surely the desire not to alienate China was a factor,” says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Overall, the region is just so heavily tied to China now.”
In Cambodia, which has increasingly gravitated into China’s orbit, Prime Minister Hun Sen insists he won’t cut air travel, beyond suspending the six weekly flights from Wuhan. He also refuses to evacuate citizens stranded in Wuhan, as other countries have done. While Beijing chided the U.S. for banning Chinese travelers, saying it “set a bad example,” Hun Sen earned plaudits when he flew to China earlier this month.
“A friend in need is a friend indeed,” he wrote on his official Facebook page.
But Hun Sen’s vehement denial of the disease’s risks has stoked fears that Cambodia, a tourism hotspot with limited health resources, will become yet another vector of transmission.
“The cost of his decision is the health of his people,” says Sophal Ear, an expert on Cambodian politics at Occidental College in California. “Cambodia has become the weakest link: a country with poor health care, poor disease surveillance, and a long rap sheet of non-reporting.”
READ MORE: The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping’s Dreams of a Chinese Century
Earlier this month, a study by five researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that it is statistically implausible that Cambodia and Thailand do not have more cases, and virtually impossible that Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has not reported a single one. Based on its direct flights from Wuhan, the archipelago should have at least five patients by now, the study found.
It’s not that these countries are getting lucky, says Marc Lipsitch, director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, and one of the study’s authors. “They’re missing infections.”
About 2 million Chinese tourists visit Indonesia annually, mostly holidaying in Bali. According to China’s consulate there, 5,000 Chinese tourists, 200 from Wuhan, were visiting the resort island when news of the outbreak suspended flights on Feb. 5. Most werenot quarantinedor tested.
“There are definitely cases. We just haven’t found them yet,” says Dr. Shela Putri Sundawa, an Indonesian physician who hosts health podcast “Relatif Perspective.”
“I think the surveillance we’re doing now is too loose.”
Doctors in Indonesia are not testing all respiratory infections for coronavirus, relying instead on weeding out suspected patients by their links to known cases or their travel history, she says.
But cases have already turned up in several countries among those who have not been to China. Missing one potential carrier can lead to further infections that can’t be linked to travel, meaning more and more patients who might never be screened.
“You can’t find things you don’t look for,” says Lipsitch, the Harvard epidemiologist. “We estimated that even high surveillance countries were missing about half their imported cases.”
He predicts that a global coronavirus pandemic is “likely” and that 40 to 70 percent of the world’s population could be infected (though they won’t all become sick).
‘So what can we investigate?’
In Indonesia, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, security minister Mohammad Mahfud MD has told reporters “the coronavirus does not exist” in the country.
Indonesia’s health officials insist their protocols follow the World Health Organization’s guidelines with a system focusing on temperature checks at arrival gates and self-reporting. Most of Southeast Asia follows this approach, even as several studies indicate border screenings are not effective.
“I think airport scanning is more of a political measure than a practical measure. It might calm people down and demonstrate that the government is doing something, but as for public health, it’s not very useful,” says Coker, the emeritus public health professor.
These screenings must catch people in a very narrow window, between when they are well enough to travel, but sick enough to detect. Temperature scanners, fickle at the best of times, will also not find anyone whose fever may have subsided after a Tylenol on the plane. And just because someone doesn’t present clinical symptoms, doesn’t mean they aren’t sick. Asymptomatic patients still in the incubation phase have shed this coronavirus, according to doctors.
Two tourists who traveled through Indonesia before later testing positive have prompted alarm. A Chinese visitor who traveled to Bali from Wuhan was reportedly confirmed to have the virus on Feb. 4, after he left, while a man from Tokyo was hospitalized with the infection soon after returning to Japan on Feb. 19.
Indonesia’s health directorate general secretary, Achmad Yurianto, told local media he did not know the Japanese man’s name or where he visited. “So what can we investigate?”
The government also said that none of the 243 people who were evacuated from Wuhan on Feb. 2 showed signs of the virus while quarantined at a military hospital on an island northwest of Borneo.
But Dr. Putri Sundawa noted that the standard quarantine lasts 14 days, while the disease incubation period can stretch potentially as long as 24 days.
“If there were no complaints of pneumonia, they would not be checked,” she says.

Relying on self-reporting once cases are introduced to the country creates further problems if patients and medical workers don’t know what to look for. An Indonesian woman with viral pneumonia was reportedly discharged because she had not been to China, while a nurse who cared for her had “no idea” the case could have been a coronavirus suspect.
It’s also hard to test for coronavirus without the right lab kits, which Indonesia lacked until February 5. The country’s health minister, a former military doctor who previously stoked controversy for urging a “brainwashing” treatment on stroke victims, determined that prayer had kept the virus away. His message to the public: “don’t be anxious.”
Myanmar, like Indonesia, has not reported a single case of coronavirus as of Friday. The restive country shares a 1,400-mile, porous border with China over which goods and people continue to flow.
Until donated testing kits arrived on Feb. 20, no domestic hospitals were able to confirm coronavirus cases. Previously, samples had to be shipped to Thailand or Hong Kong with results taking up to one week.
In a country with limited political freedoms and a kneejerk reaction to negative press, the government has kept a tight lid on coronavirus. Even government spokespeople said they did not have permission to comment on what preparations were being taken for an outbreak. Rather than empower the spread of information, the Health Ministry has reportedly proposed amending legislation to punish any healthcare workers who talk to the press or public about the virus with up to six months in jail or a $70 fine.
‘Extreme risk’
“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said earlier this month.
With the exception of small and affluent Singapore, which experts have praised for its response to coronavirus, Southeast Asian governments spend little on health per capita by international standards. Even Indonesia, with a population of nearly 270 million spread over thousands of islands, faces discrepancies in health resources and suffers an overall shortage of facilities and personnel.
While admitting they may struggle amid an outbreak, Indonesian health officials insist they will contain the virus before it becomes one. But many health experts say it’s too late, as coronavirus will ultimately evade containment.
Coker, in Bangkok, says all countries should be preparing for a pandemic and implementing mitigation measures, like closing schools, preparing hospitals and redistributing medical staff as needed. Southeast Asian countries, he says, should assume they have cases.
The U.K.’s National Health Services has already seemingly made the leap. Anyone returning from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos with symptoms, however mild, is advised to call the NHS hotline. Global risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft warns of “extreme risk” in Indonesia and Cambodia based on those countries’ ability to respond to a pandemic.
Yet even amid concerns about regional preparedness and possible equipment shortages, several Southeast Asian nations have been rushing to donate goggles, face masks and respirators to China. Laos, with a GDP comparable to Mali’s and Afghanistan’s, mustered $400,000 and $100,000-worth of supplies for the world’s second-largest economy after a national fundraising campaign.
Such political genuflection may have broad consequences. How nations across the world cope with coronavirus, and what they choose to prioritize, could resonate globally. And because of cross-border travel, migration and international tourism, Southeast Asia is highly interconnected with the rest of the world.
As countries everywhere grapple with or brace for coronavirus, the possibility of undetected cases spreading throughout the region underscores how the virus can no longer be assumed to stay confined to a handful of outbreak clusters.
“The significance of not recognizing the true breadth of the outbreak is that it continues to suggest to some that the travel bans and quarantines are effective tools in limiting global spread,” says virologist Christopher Mores at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.
“The sooner this outbreak is appreciated for the pandemic it has become, the better for a coordinated global response.”

In its announcement, the company wrote that the program is an “injection of up to $100 million” and is in addition to the previous COVID-19 response programs it announced in mid-March. As the company explained to The Verge, it won’t exactly be giving out money — it simply expects the value of reduced commissions to reach that amount. And, in case the value of reduced commissions go beyond $100 million before May ends, it will still continue charging eligible restaurants 50 percent off."

The study, done by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the overall chances of dying from COVID-19 — the disease caused by the virus — are 2.3%. Other estimates suggest the fatality rate could be higher: around 4.3%. The current rate, based on the ratio of reported deaths to total cases worldwide, hovers around 3.4%.
But the Chinese CDC study found that the fatality rate rate rose to 8% for patients in their 70s and 15% among those in their 80s.Out of more than 44,000 coronavirus patients studied, the majority of deaths were among those at least 60 or older.
Older patients are also more likely to have preexisting health problems. The first patient to die of the coronavirus in the US, for instance, was a man in his 50s who had been chronically ill before getting infected.
Nearly 5,300 patients in the Chinese study reported a health condition not related to the virus, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Around 7% of those cases — more than 370 patients — died. Overall, patients with preexisting conditions represented more than a third of all deaths reported in the study. The fatality rate for patients who reported no underlying health problem was less than 1%. 
Here's the mortality rate for each preexisting condition reported in the study:
Ruobing Su/Business Insider
The authors were missing the health history of more than 20,000 patients in their study, but their research is still provides one of the broadest pictures so far of how COVID-19 operates in humans.
Among coronavirus patients, the preexisting condition that raises risk most appears to be heart disease. Patients already diagnosed with heart disease had a fatality rate of more than 10%. Diabetes was the preexisting condition with the second-highest fatality rate: 7%. 
Patients with the most commonly reported preexisting condition, hypertension (high blood pressure), had a fatality rate of 6%. Coronavirus patients with cancer had a similar fatality rate. 
In total, COVID-19 has killed nearly 3,000 people and infected around 86,000. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, central China's most populous city, and has since spread to at least 58 other countries. More than 90% of cases are on the Chinese mainland.

In a petition filed with the FCC in late March, media watchdog Free Press wrote that the briefings were so full of incorrect and misleading information that the communications regulator had a duty to at the very least investigate and report on the broadcasts:
Of particular and urgent concern is the deadly disinformation broadcast on television stations across the country in the form of context-less coverage of President Donald Trump’s press conferences and other statements…
We urge the FCC to conduct an urgent examination into the extent to which broadcasters have aired hoaxes and false or misleading information about COVID-19, and immediately issue an emergency policy statement or enforcement guidance recommending that broadcasters prominently disclose when information they air is false or scientifically suspect.
It’s a big ask that a federal agency should step in and say the president is perpetrating a hoax on the country. And while the accuracy of the information in the briefings is certainly questionable for instance the president’s repeated assurances that the pandemic “will disappear,” that there are plenty of “beautiful” tests, and that the unproven chloroquine is effective against the virus the FCC determined that it was not advisable or possible to restrict their broadcast.
A simple “no” with the requisite technical details probably would have sufficed, but the FCC opted to post on its front page a more lengthy takedown of the Free Press petition. If that seems a bit excessive, recall that Free Press has been a frequent and effective critic of the FCC, calling out a nonsensical economic analysis at the heart of the agency’s justification for rolling back net neutrality, and more recently exposing an embarrassing error that inflated broadband deployment numbers in the country by millions.
So perhaps there is something more to the decision to perform a more meticulous dismantling of Free Press’s petition. All the same, the FCC’s response provides valuable information on why the agency both can’t and shouldn’t take the actions suggested:
The Commission does notand cannot and will notact as a self-appointed, free-roving arbiter of truth in journalism. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Free Presss assertions regarding any lack of veracity were true, false speech enjoys some First Amendment protection, and section 326 of the Communications Act, reflecting First Amendment values, prohibits the Commission from interfering with freedom of the press or censoring broadcast communications.
…The Commission has historically regulated the broadcast of dangerous hoaxes. But the Commission has applied this rule narrowly in light of the substantial First Amendment concerns involved with the federal government policing the content of broadcast news.
At this moment, broadcasters face the challenge of covering a rapidly-evolving, national, and international health crisis, in which new informationmuch of it medical or technical in nature and therefore difficult to corroborate or refute in real timeis continually revealed, vetted, and verified or dismissed.
Under such circumstances, it is implausible, if not absurd, to suggest that broadcasters knowingly deceived the public by airing these press conferences or other statements by the President about COVID-19.
Instead, the FCC suggests that the broadcast of incorrect information merely presents a new opportunity for journalists to add context and correction to the record. As it concludes, with a parting shot at Free Press:
We leave to the press its time-honored and constitutionally protected role in testing the claims made by our political leadersas well as those made by national advocacy organizations.
The full text of the FCC denial (PDF) is an educational read if, like many these days, you wonder about the potential of a government entity like the FCC stepping in to control the airwaves in a time of crisis."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said two more Americans tested positive for the virus out of the group of quarantined passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington state worried about the virus spreading through West Coast communities after confirming three patients were infected by unknown means.
The World Health Organization upgraded the risk level from the virus to “very high” as it continued to spread around the globe. Friday evening, the State Department issued an advisory telling Americans to avoid nonessential travel to Italy, which has seen nearly 900 cases. A travel advisory already is in place for China.
Two days after the White House abruptly shifted gears from President Donald Trump’s initial assurances of minimal U.S. fallout to an all-out mobilization under Vice President Mike Pence, the administration’s messaging still wasn’t completely seamless.
Trump administration political appointees and nonpartisan career government scientists both agree that the current risk to Americans is low, although that could quickly change. But some political officials are continuing to offer assurances that concerns will blow over soon, while the scientists are emphasizing preparations for circumstances as yet unknown.
“I acknowledge that this could change. I acknowledge the situation could deteriorate. I acknowledge the risks,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday. “But, given what we know … looks to me like the market has gone too far.”
Financial markets continued to slide, with the Dow Jones average suffering its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.
Later in the day Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank would cut interest rates to support the economy if needed. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers of both parties are working on a spending bill to be unveiled early next week and expected to be two to three times more than the $2.5 billion the White House had requested for anti-virus efforts.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called attention to the breadth of options under consideration, telling reporters the administration may invoke the 1950 Defense Production Act to ensure production of needed supplies for anti-virus effort. For example, the government says it needs 300 million masks for health care workers, but only has 30 million stockpiled.
“We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary,” said Azar. “So that is the authority that we have and we intend to use to acquire anything we need to acquire.” However, he added the government wants to avoid disruptions.
Shortly before the new California case was announced, Trump told reporters, “We’re at the same number.”
“We haven’t lost anybody yet and hopefully we can keep that intact,” he said as he left the White House for a political rally in South Carolina.
Trump said he’s still considering denying entry to people from countries affected by coronavirus. “We’re looking at that right now,” he said. “And we’re looking at a couple of countries, a few countries that have little bit disproportionately high number, and we’re going to make that decision very soon.”
For the CDC’s disease detectives, the priority now is setting up a nationwide testing infrastructure after a shaky start. Dr. Nancy Messonier, the CDC’s chief of respiratory diseases, told reporters the goal is to have every state capable of testing for the virus by the end of next week.
A three-step test kit from CDC is being replaced with a two-step process that Messonnier said should work better.
“Our goal is to have every state and local health department doing its own testing by the end of next week,” said Messonnier. That’s a considered a critical step, because it would push the front lines of surveillance closer to local communities where new cases might present themselves.
Disease detectives are still tracing the contacts of a Northern California woman who may be the first person in the U.S. to get sick without having traveled to China or having been in close contact with a returning traveler.
“We need to remember right now that the case count in the U.S. is really low,” said Messonnier. “That is a reflection of the aggressive containment efforts of the U.S. government. We hope that if there is spread, the spread will be limited and that any disease in the United States will be mild.”
The global virus outbreak has become a test of Trump’s credibility and his administration’s capacity to protect the nation. Public health experts say the president should let the scientists in government take the lead.
“The White House functions best when it follows the leadership of experts in emergency response,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonprofit Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve public health.
Although the president himself is famously skeptical of science, the White House is now trying to surround itself with top-flight scientific expertise. Friday, officials announced the White House and the National Academy of Sciences have established a committee of experts on infectious diseases to help on the coronavirus threat.
“We are creating a direct line to the nation’s top scientific minds on public health,” said Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Next week, Congress is expected to expedite a bipartisan spending bill for the anti-virus campaign that could total between $6 billion and $8 billion.
The administration says it has enough funding to get through to April but that Congress should act as quickly as possible to approve additional funding. The White House wants Trump to sign the spending bill it by mid-March.
As other countries hard hit by coronavirus cancel public activities and shutter schools, HHS Secretary Azar said such measures could be part of the containment toolkit here, if needed.
Keeping kids home from school and running workplaces on a skeleton staff is part of what experts call “social distancing,” a way to keep people from passing disease to one another. As recently as 2009, a flu pandemic led to school closures in many U.S. communities.
“It can be indicated under certain circumstances that it might make sense to close a school or schools, or take other measures like that,” said Azar. In the U.S. that would be a decision made at the local level.
“What we’re all trying to do is just be very transparent … with the public to get our mental frame around that there are things that you might see,” said Azar. “That doesn’t mean you will see (them).”

Vice President Mike Pence announced the new restrictions and warnings as President Donald Trump said 22 people in the U.S. have been stricken by the new coronavirus, including four deemed “very ill” and that additional cases are “likely.” Trump added that he was considering additional restrictions, including closing the U.S. border with Mexico in response to the virus’ spread.
“We’re thinking about all borders,” Trump said.
Trump provided an update on the virus from the White House press briefing room for the second time this week after the first reported U.S. death Saturday, of a woman he described as being in her late 50s and having a high medical risk. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was “no evidence of link to travel” in the case of the woman who died.
On Friday, health officials confirmed a second case of coronavirus in the U.S. in a person who didn’t travel internationally or have close contact with anyone who had the virus. The U.S. has a total of about 60 confirmed cases. Trump’s tally appeared to exclude cases of Americans repatriated from two cruise ships in Asia.
Trump said healthy Americans should be able to recover if they contract the new virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets spooked by the virus threat.
He encouraged Americans not to alter their daily routines, saying the country is “super prepared” for a wider outbreak, adding “there’s no reason to panic at all.”
He added he wasn’t altering his routine either. “You’re talking about 22 people right now in this whole very vast country. I think we’ll be in very good shape.”
Trump spoke a day after he denounced criticism of his response to the threat as a “hoax” cooked up by his political enemies. Speaking at a rally in South Carolina he accused Democrats of “politicizing” the coronavirus threat and boasted about preventive steps he’s ordered in an attempt to keep the virus that originated in China from spreading across the United States. Those steps include barring entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China.
“They tried the impeachment hoax. … This is their new hoax,” Trump said of Democratic denunciations of his administration’s coronavirus response.
Trump said Saturday he was not trying to minimize the threat of the virus.
“Again, the hoax was used in respect to Democrats and what they were saying,” he said.
Some Democrats have said Trump could have acted sooner to bolster the U.S. response to the virus. Democratic and Republican lawmakers also have said his request for an additional $2.5 billion to defend against the virus isn’t enough. They’ve signaled they will provide substantially more funding.
Trump said Democrats want him to fail and argued that steps he’s taken so far have kept cases to a minimum and prevented virus deaths in the U.S.
As global markets plunged this week, Trump predicted they will come back, and encouraged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
“The markets will all come back,” he said. “I think the Fed has a very important role, especially psychological. If you look at it, the Fed has a massive impact.”

In video shared by NBC News 4 San Antonio, Appleby can be seen explaining what COVID-19 cases have been like across her city, and recalling a tragic tale of a coronavirus patient's last words to a nurse.
""I heard a heartbreaking story this week. We cared for a 30-year-old patient at Methodist Hospital who told their nurse that they attended a 'COVID party,'"" Appleby says. ""This is a party held by somebody diagnosed with the COVID virus, and the thought is that people get together to see if the virus is real and if anyone gets infected.""
""Just before the patient died, they looked at their nurse and they said, 'I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax but it's not,'"" Appleby continues. ""This is just one example of a potentially avoidable death of a young member of our community, and I can't imagine the loss of the family.""
Though there's been a great deal of skepticism surrounding the idea of intentional COVID parties, if you attend a gathering with a large number of people and don't take accurate safety precautions, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and sanitizing your hands, you're undoubtedly putting yourself at greater risk of contracting the virus.
In the video above, which is featured in the NBC News 4 San Antonio article, Appleby explains that lately, San Antonio has been seeing the coronavirus ""affect a broader age range of people, including young people in their 20s and 30s.""
""In Methodist Hospital today we have several 20-year-olds and several 30-year-olds that are critically ill,"" she says. ""Some of these younger folks come to the hospital for treatment and can be discharged home, yet others become ill very quickly and require intensive care.""

Follow her @DrJenLee. Opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. 
 (CNN)On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that it would wind down the White House coronavirus task force. Confirming this to CNN, a senior White House official said the task force ""will be phased down around Memorial Day.""
This came as a shock, as the University of Washington's model, which the White House seemed to trust, predicted deaths in the US to be almost twice as high as it previously estimated, with the daily toll rising to nearly 3000 by the beginning of June. 
Luckily, President Donald Trump seemed to change course on Wednesday, tweeting that ""the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.""
This tweet is a huge relief to those of us who appreciate the benefit of having a task force in times of crisis. Disbanding it would have been a dangerous move that would have made it even harder to contain this virus in the weeks and months to come. 
Here's why the task force is vital: 
We are battling fatigue and complacency 
Though we are far from being out of the woods, we are already battling fatigue and increasing complacency when it comes to the virus. State and local leaders are under extreme pressure to reopen their communities and some have made concessions to relax restrictions whether they meet the criteria suggested by the White House or not. 
When the White House coronavirus task force let the national social distancing guidelines expire on April 30, and provided only the less stringent state guidance for reopening, it sent an implied message that the situation has improved enough that there is no need for further federal direction and the rest is up to the states. 
Winding down the task force would have entirely reinforced this message and left state leaders with even less top cover. It would have also signaled that the virus is no longer a top priority, which could have made it harder for some state leaders to emphasize that the virus is a very real and ongoing threat.
Coordination and decision-making are crucial right now
Effective coordination and communication between federal agencies -- and between federal and state agencies -- has been an ongoing challenge throughout this crisis. 
This is not a new phenomenon. Having served in leadership positions in both federal and state government, I can attest to how difficult it is to achieve seamless cooperation among the most competent and well intended public servants even in the best of times. Often, agencies will have different ideas about how to solve a problem -- and someone at a higher level needs to make a decision quickly about how to move forward. 
That's why in the event of an emergency or crisis it often takes the formation of a task force or similar command structure to bring together disparate agencies to share information, clarify roles, and work together towards a common purpose. In the absence of this, agencies tend to quickly default to working in siloes. One of the reasons testing has been such a difficult nut to crack is because it is so dependent on collaboration and coordination between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state and local governments, and the private sector. Dissolving the task force would have made this even harder.
Covid-19 spreads at a frightening speed
The speed of viral spread is one aspect that makes Covid-19 difficult to contain. On March 5th, there were 12 deaths due to Covid-19 in the US. Nine weeks later, there have now been over 71,000 deaths.
At every point along the way, the virus has moved faster than our ability to contain it. Speed and agility are not often strengths of government agencies. Concerns over shortages of resources, like the protective personal equipment needed by medical personnel, were not taken seriously enough by leaders who could have prioritized acquiring the necessary supplies.
As anyone who has worked in government knows, there is a chain of command. Important decisions often must be approved by agency leaders or the White House. These processes are typically slow and it is all too easy for key insights or pieces of information to get lost along the way, even unintentionally. That's why a task force structure that allows for subject matter experts to come together, share information and brief political leaders is most efficient way to inform decision making during a time of crisis. 
The crucial importance of how we observe Memorial Day
As more states loosen restrictions, we may be entering an even more dangerous phase of this pandemic, potentially setting ourselves up for serious outbreaks across the country.
Hokkaido, Japan, provides a perfect example of what can happen if lockdowns are lifted too early. According to TIME, in late February, the island had the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all prefectures in Japan. 
On February 28, the governor declared a state of emergency, closed schools and encouraged people to stay at home.
Many restaurants and businesses also closed. By mid-March, the situation had turned the corner; the health crisis largely stabilized and pressure from businesses to reopen began to grow. In response, on March 19, the governor of Hokkaido lifted the state of emergency but asked residents to continue social distancing and stay home if they felt sick.
Unfortunately, the announcement came just before a three-day weekend, when many residents ventured out to celebrate the lifting of the restrictions. As TIME reported, Dr. Kiyoshi Nagase, chairman of the Hokkaido Medical Association, believes this likely started a second wave of infections in Hokkaido. On April 14, 26 days later, the governor announced a second state of emergency and reimposed restrictions. 
The upcoming Memorial Day weekend in the US is not only a national holiday to honor those who have died in military service, but it is also the start of the summer season. Many Americans will be planning travel and recreational activities for that weekend which could lead to further spread of the virus. By then, some states will also have relaxed restrictions for weeks, enough time for an outbreak to have surfaced, assuming that testing is in place to detect one fast enough.
It is entirely possible that the continuation of the task force will lead to new national guidelines for protective measures as the summer starts. We can only hope that this is the case, otherwise we may find ourselves facing a second wave of the pandemic -- and countless more deaths to come."

Ulster County health officials are searching for anyone who may have had their haircut at the barbershop over the last three weeks, a statement from the county says. Kingston is located roughly 90 miles north of New York City.
""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease and learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening,"" said Dr. Carol Smith, the health commissioner for Ulster County, in a statement.
County health officials are recommending anyone who received a haircut at the shop on Broadway during the past three weeks to get tested for the coronavirus. 
""This kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" Smith said.
There are currently 1,563 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ulster County and 64 fatalities, according to the county. People who came in contact with the Kingston barbershop should contact the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health.
According to directives from state Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons or other personal hygiene services had to remain closed.
Speaking about this particular case on Thursday, Cuomo said hairstyling is by definition an up-close and personal occupation and so it would be part of phase two of reopening. 
NYC contact tracing efforts
Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says hundreds of people have been trained to begin contact tracing and will start work in the coming days.
New York City will have 1,000 contact tracers by the end of the month, and by the beginning of June they plan to get up to 2,500 trained individuals, according to de Blasio. It would then build as needed to potentially go up to as many as 10,000 tracers.
The effort is being led by NYC Health and Hospitals. The contact tracers will investigate cases, trace and monitor contacts, and manage all case data and inquiries. This would allow the city to immediately isolate and care for those who test positive for the virus, and then rapidly track, assess, and quarantine anyone they came into contact with who they may have infected, according to a NYC Health and Hospitals press release.
The effort is ""bigger, more complex and a much greater operational challenge than anything we've seen in the history of contact tracing in this city,"" the mayor said. The Department of Health and their expertise are being brought in for ""maximum impact,"" he added.

Vinay Prasad is an oncologist, associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University and author of ""Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Medicine Harm People With Cancer."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)The concern was that Covid-19 would overwhelm the medical care system with patients. While that has happened in some hot spots, the broader picture is just the opposite: Covid-19 has deprived the system of patients. 
Some of these would-be patients have surely been hurt: having either shied away or been told to stay away from interventions that would have helped them live longer and/or live better. For others the delay may not matter; they will do equally well with intervention at a later date. But it is important to consider another possible outcome: some do better with less medical care. 
No one has national data yet, but the turn of events is remarkable. 
In mid-March hospitals began to cancel elective surgeries both to protect patients and to provide surge capacity, following guidance from the American College of Surgeons. This not only halted hernia repairs and joint replacements, but also surgeries for low-risk cancers -- specifically, early stage breast and prostate cancer.
Next, emergency care unexpectedly plummeted. Emergency rooms in Boston, Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul saw substantial drops in volume, and ER doctors are experiencing cuts to both their hours and pay. The decline in volume doesn't appear to be confined to fewer minor injuries and self-limited illnesses, it also includes fewer heart attacks and strokes.
But the impact of Covid-19 goes well beyond the hospital to include all physician/patient encounters. Despite the advent of telehealth, primary care practices are seeing fewer patients and laying off staff. The American Academy of Family Physicians estimates that about 40% of family medicine clinics are at risk of closing by the end of June -- more than doubling the number of US counties with a significant shortfall in health care providers at the end of March. 
Given fewer outpatient visits, one downstream effect is wholly expected: fewer lab tests and X-rays. This limits efforts to find disease early in asymptomatic individuals. Most notably, cancer screening has been effectively shut down.
What can we learn from this cataclysmic disruption in medical intervention? 
Previous research on the global effects of doctor strikes suggests that overall mortality either remains stable -- or, in fact, declines. Clearly, it will be important to carefully study 2020 mortality trends and disentangle Covid-related deaths from other causes of death. It will be equally important to distinguish the well-off from the poor: we may find that medical care disruption decreases mortality among the well-off, yet increases mortality among the poor.
While analysis of overall mortality is important, so, too, is looking into more granular topics. The disruption in elective surgeries should lead us to reevaluate the necessity of those surgeries and their associated risks. There are opportunities to look at still finer detail: In our hospitals (Brigham and OHSU), for example,women with early-stage breast cancer are having their surgeries delayed and are instead being started on hormonal therapy. Maybe we will learn that some women don't need surgery.
Suspending cancer screening is another important area to study. There is little doubt, for example, that the decline in mammography will lead to fewer breast cancers diagnosed. But is that a bad thing or good thing? 
One opportunity is to study what happens to US cancer statistics when screening is resumed. One of two observations are possible. Rates of breast cancer might catch up: meaning the deficit in cancers during the pandemic would be matched by a surplus of cancers in subsequent years. In other words, all the cancers that sat undetected in patients during the pandemic would be eventually found. The alternative would be that breast cancer diagnoses never catch up. 
Years ago, researchers observed this phenomenon in Norway. Women, ages 50-64, who underwent three mammograms over six years had more invasive breast cancers found compared to similar women who had a single mammogram at the end of six years. Delayed mammography led to less breast cancer diagnoses and the deficit never caught up -- despite a mammogram at the end of six years. These findings suggest that some small cancers regress on their own. Might this be happening right now during the Covid-19 pandemic?
The decline in heart attack and strokes raises equally important questions in cardiovascular disease. Some patients may have been reluctant to come to the hospital and suffered, perhaps even died, at home. However, what ""counts"" as a heart attack or stroke has expanded over the years. An alternative explanation may be that doctors are no longer diagnosing patients with very mild cardiac or neurologic abnormalities. Perhaps what is being missed are painless, minor events for which treatment is unneeded -- or even harmful. 
It's also possible that there are genuinely fewer heart attacks and strokes occurring right now. Smog is disappearing in Los Angeles and, in India, people can see the Himalayas from miles away for the first time in 30 years. Air pollution has been consistently linked to heart attacks. And ""hunkering down"" has meant slowing down for many. Has better air and lifestyle helped our hearts?
After Covid-19, if we dare imagine the day, it will be important to ask who was harmed by delayed and forgone medical care. But the severe financial strains on individuals and public budgets make it just as essential to ask who benefited from avoiding interventions with no salutatory effect. 
But we won't find the benefits unless we look for them. We need physician researchers willing to ask hard questions about services they deliver -- questions that may threaten their own professional/financial self-interests. 
Covid-19 provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to study what happens when the well-oiled machine of medical care downshifts from high to low volume in order to focus on acutely ill patients. It will be comfortable for physician researchers to study what was lost. It will be courageous for them to study what was gained."

 (CNN)An interesting moment in Fox News reporter Chris Wallace's memorable interview of President Donald was a confusing back and forth about Covid-19 related deaths. The President claimed that the US had the ""number one low mortality rate"" in the world -- whereas Wallace insisted the US had little to crow about.
Though it is clear that Trump is completely wrong, comparing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mortality of each affected country turns out be a very tricky business. Because no one metric is perfect, especially when used to compare impact across countries, there is a large corner of epidemiology dedicated to how to most accurately tabulate death. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) devotes a long entry to addressing which is the best metric for a given situation in its online course, ""Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice."" 
As Covid-19 reporting has evolved, the death count has been the most cited number to track the size of the tragedy in the US and other countries. According to John Hopkins University, more than 148,000 human lives in the US have been lost because of this disease. 
Much time could and should be spent on understanding the death count, especially since a growing proportion of the US -- now 31% -- thinks the count is an overestimate. In contrast, most public health experts feel strongly that this is an underestimate. 
The simple death count is not used in comparisons to other countries, due to vast differences in country population sizes. To account for this variation, most public health experts prefer to use rates, not counts. 
The two most popular rate measures are the case fatality ratio (CFR) and the rate per total population (those with and without the disease) called the mortality rate. The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which Chris Wallace and Fox News cited during the President's interview, offers users an easy toggle between the two measures. 
The CFR measures the number of deaths divided by the number of people diagnosed with the disease. The advantage of this metric is that it is intuitive and is exactly what an individual person with Covid-19 wants to know -- given the diagnosis, what is the likelihood I will die? The disadvantage is substantial because CFR can change depending on how much of a population is tested for a disease. 
As an example, think of a country with 100 people where four people are hospitalized with Covid-19 and six others are diagnosed but are well enough to stay home. If no contact tracing or community tracing is done, only 10 people are known to have the infection. Three of these 10 people die, yielding a CFR of 30%.
Now consider if the same country with that population of the 10 infected people above performed contact tracing and community testing and diagnosed 10 additional persons with no or mild symptoms. As with the first example, three people die. But here the CFR is 15% (three deaths in 20 known cases). In other words, a higher testing rate leads to a lower CFR -- a point that might make a testing fan out of the President.
To circumvent the large problem introduced by diagnostic test volume, the mortality rate, in contrast, uses total population (those with the disease -- diagnosed or not -- AND those without the disease). Everyone. Period. 
This metric has little value to a patient who wants to know his prognosis but measures exactly what public health authorities need to know -- how bad is this in my country compared to others. Using the above example of the 100-person country with three Covid-19 deaths, the mortality rate would be 3%, no matter how many people were tested. 
The Johns Hopkins data used by many news outlets, including CNN and others, presents a table with information on the 20 countries most affected by Covid-19. During the interview, Wallace showed CFR results (though he called them mortality rates) and said, correctly, that US is 7th (it is now 10th) among these 20 countries -- nowhere near ""number one"" lowest in the world. 
Even worse? From the way Kayleigh McEnany quickly produced the tables upon thePresident's request, it appears that the information used by the White House in the interview might be used in their decision-making as well. 
Their statistics are pulled from another (non-American) source, Our World in Data compiled by the UK's Oxford University. This data uses CFR and, unfortunately for those hoping the President will see the unfiltered truth, allows anyone to select as many or as few countries as they wish to frame the crisis according to their specific goals. 
Though it is difficult to discern in the interview video (at about 2:45 in), President Trump used a graph that included information on only seven countries. In this group, the US ranked 4th (to my eye) with a CFR worse than Iceland, Brazil and South Korea. Again, even with the White House's carefully curated data, the US is mediocre at best. 
An even more sobering view of how the US is doing is our actual mortality rate per 100,000 people (not CFR). Using this metric in the Johns Hopkins data, the US has the 17th worst mortality rate of the 20 most affected countries. 
The number or rate of deaths from Covid-19 in the United States is a disaster no matter what metric is used. And it is clear from the interview that President Trump willingly presents misinformation he is given, even as the cameras are rolling. 
But perhaps the most disturbing aspect of watching the interview is how strongly it suggests that the data being given to the President is deliberately incomplete.
He is informed, apparently, of how the US ranks in CFR against six other countries using the metric that public health experts view as inferior to the mortality rate. 
At every step of the way, it seems, those entrusted to present the truth to the President have chosen instead to willingly protect their own well-being over that of the people of the United States."

As many countries roll out bailout packages to counter the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report says investment in these four key ocean intervention areas could help aid economic recovery both now and in the future:
-- Conservation and restoration of mangroves
-- Decarbonization of the shipping industry
-- Scaling up offshore wind production
-- Increasing sustainable protein from the ocean 
""They give jobs and livelihoods to people and communities and you're doing so by investing in making your environment more sustainable,"" said Manaswita Konar, lead author of the report. The study found that these four areas all give between five and 10 times the return on investment in terms of economic, environmental and health benefits, and could provide minimum net returns of $8.2 trillion over 30 years.
The report builds on research last year from the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy showing how ocean-based climate action can provide a fifth of the carbon emissions cuts needed to achieve the Paris Climate Accord goal of only 1.5 degrees of global warming.
New research shows that global temperatures could exceed that 1.5 degrees target in the next five years.
The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy is a coalition of 14 world leaders focused on developing a sustainable ocean economy. The group includes Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and leaders from Norway, Jamaica, Indonesia, Mexico and Kenya.
The world's oceans support 3.5% to 7% of global GDP, a number set to double by 2030, according to the report. Marine ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses sequester more carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests and also provide invaluable coastal protection against hurricanes and sea level rise, which are exacerbated by climate change.
With the world's population due to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, sustainable low-carbon sources of protein from the ocean, like fish and shellfish, can help reduce the pressure on emissions-intensive, land-based farming of livestock such as beef and lamb. 
The new report details how these benefits or ""ocean services"" are increasingly under threat due to pollution, rising human population, overfishing and climate change. Some of these factors have already led to devastating acidification of coral reefs and loss of biodiversity in recent years, with over a third of corals and marine mammals threatened with extinction. 
""Often the ocean is portrayed ... as a victim of climate change and now also as a victim of the economic crisis post-Covid, but rarely do we think about ocean-based investments and solutions in terms of addressing these challenges,"" said Konar. 
In light of the economic challenges facing many governments worldwide, there has been a concerted push from environmental groups to pressure policymakers to stick to their commitments on carbon emissions and help stimulate a greener economy, amid concerns that climate action could take a backseat to short-term economic recovery. 
The International Energy Agency has released a report produced with the International Monetary Fund calling for a $3 trillion investment in green recovery with the potential to create around 9 million jobs a year. 
The ocean economy has been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, facing huge losses from downturns in tourism, fisheries and shipping.
""The challenge for ocean protection is there's a tendency to use the pandemic not to do the management that we already agreed to do,"" according to Jackie Savitz, chief policy officer for America ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana. 
Savitz said she has seen moves to weaken fisheries management in the US rather than make them more sustainable. ""We have to be careful we don't undo all the good work we've done to date.""
The good news is she says that in many ways, ocean protection needn't be a huge financial investment for cash-strapped governments.
For example, strategies like setting science-based limits on fishing so that stocks can recover, practicing selective fishing to protect endangered species and ensuring that fishing gear doesn't destroy ocean habitats are all effective, cost-efficient ways to manage sustainable fisheries. 
""For a lot of it, it's just good management,"" said Savitz. ""The real high cost comes in political will and making the right decisions that benefit citizens in the future. And unfortunately, that seems to be the hardest thing to do."""

""We are now having 40,000 cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around,"" Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing.
Turning it around will take a coordinated, collaborative effort, he said at the hearing, not the ""disparate responses"" the nation has shown so far. 
But without strong national leadership, that coordination may be up to mayors and governors, according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former biotechnology executive and professor at Harvard's medical and public health schools.
""This situation is now so grim and is getting worse by the day,"" he said. ""From now on, they know it's in their backyard and their job to take care of it if no one else does.""
Most of the US has the pandemic in their backyard, with only two states showing a downward trend in cases from last week. The surge comes as restriction-fatigued Americans increasingly gather in large groups for summer recreation.
Precautions like social distancing and mask wearing are meant to help people ""enjoy themselves within the safe guidelines,"" Fauci said.
""We should not look at the public health endeavors as being an obstruction to opening up. We should look at it as a vehicle to opening up,"" he said. 
Turning the tide means more masks and less bars
The measures health experts tout to curb the virus are especially important considering more than 90% of the country has not experienced the virus, meaning herd immunity could still be years away, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Senate HELP committee on Tuesday. 
Both Redfield and Fauci stressed the importance of widespread masks, which experts have encouraged for months even as President Donald Trump has noticeably forgone them.
An environment with universal masks is ""fundamentally the most important thing we can do,"" Redfield said.
What people shouldn't do in this pandemic, Fauci said Tuesday, is head to the bar. 
""Bars: really not good, really not good. Congregation at a bar, inside, is bad news. We really have got to stop that,"" Fauci said Tuesday.
Without those measures, Fauci said, the US will continue to be in trouble.
""Clearly, we are not in total control right now,"" he said. ""The numbers speak for themselves.""
California and Florida chart different coronavirus paths as cases spike
Officials in California and Florida -- two states where coronavirus cases are jumping -- are taking different approaches toward reopening amid spikes in infections.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told the reporters that there's no going back to stricter measures, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom hinted that on Wednesday he'll tighten restrictions this Independence Day weekend, especially at beaches.
As the holiday weekend looms, Newsom warned that family gatherings -- where households tend to let down their guards mixing with extended family -- are the greatest concern.
""It's not just bars, not just out in the streets with people protesting, and the like,"" Newsom said.
Newsom ordered bars in seven counties to close over the weekend and said he will announce more restrictions on Wednesday.
Newsom has repeatedly promised that reopening the state comes with the ability to ""toggle back"" if necessary.
Responding to a reporter's question about the beaches being closed in Los Angeles County for the Independence Day weekend, the governor hinted that state beaches could be part of his announcement.
In Florida, DeSantis assured reporters that his state can deal with the uptick in cases and it's not necessary to shut down shops and restaurants.
""We're not going back, closing things,"" he said. ""I mean, people going to business is not what's driving it.""
DeSantis' message to Floridians, particularly the younger ones: Protect the vulnerable.
""You have a responsibility not to come into close contact with folks who could be more vulnerable,"" he said.
Many cases are undetected
Cases in Florida have increased more than 50% from last week, and experts have warned the state could become the next epicenter, similar to New York in the spring.
But DeSantis said he rejected experts' predictions, adding that the state can handle whatever comes.
""People were predicting you know 400,000 people hospitalized, never came,"" he told CNN's Randi Kaye. While cases are rising, he said that the percentage of tests coming back positive is still ""low"" at 10% to 15%.
But US Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Mark McClellan, said Tuesday that the real case numbers may be higher than reported -- and the number of new cases may already be at 100,000 per day.
""Remember, a lot of cases are going undetected because not everybody can get testing,"" McClellan told Jim Acosta on The Situation Room.
And he predicts things will get worse before they get better.
""It just really emphasizes the importance of taking further steps, on wearing masks, on pausing reopening, on taking steps ahead of July 4th to avoid big crowds,"" McClellan said.

It's a problem that people across the country need to be on the lookout for, the CDC says. The bacteria, which can cause deadly pneumonia, grow in warm or stagnant water.
The plumbing in buildings that have been closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic could provide a perfect breeding ground for Legionella and other waterborne pathogens, the CDC cautions.
It even happened to the CDC itself.
""During the recent closures at our leased space in Atlanta, working through the General Services Administration (GSA), CDC directed the landlord to take protective actions,"" the CDC said in a statement to CNN.
""Despite their best efforts, CDC has been notified that Legionella, which can cause Legionnaires' Disease, is present in a cooling tower as well as in some water sources in the buildings. Out of an abundance of caution, we have closed these buildings until successful remediation is complete.""
Legionella bacteria are common in water everywhere. They're usually only a problem when the water gets aerosolized and people breathe it in. Showers and fountains are common sources. The name dates back to 1976, when an outbreak among people at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia affected 182 people and killed 29 of them.
People most at risk include the elderly, smokers, people with suppressed immune systems and diabetics.
Last year, the CDC reports, 4,294 cases were reported. So far this year, 1,813 cases have been reported.
It's not yet clear if the pandemic has worsened the problem, or perhaps eased it because people are not gathering at large hotels or working in big factory buildings as much, said Chris Edens, an epidemiologist on CDC's Legionella team. He said state health departments that normally monitor and report cases of Legionella infection are tied up dealing with coronavirus.
And no national entity systematically checks buildings to see if the bacteria has started growing in the plumbing. ""There is currently no nationwide surveillance of water systems for Legionella disease,"" Edens said.
As people return to work and start to travel more, hospitals and clinics need to think about the possibility of Legionella, Edens said. ""Flu and coronavirus are not the only things that can cause severe pneumonia,"" he said. If people turn up with pneumonia, it's worth testing them for Legionella -- especially since it can be treated with antibiotics, unlike flu or coronavirus.
Many different buildings could be at risk, and building managers need to be aware during prolonged closures. ""We are talking hotels, we are talking large office buildings, we are even talking certain kinds of factories ... a lot of those buildings have been shut down,"" Edens told CNN.
""This water has been sitting and could be at risk of Legionella growth.""
Poorly maintained cooling towers are another potential source.
The fix is not difficult. ""You want to keep the cold water cold and you want to keep your hot water hot,"" Edens said. Legionella flourishes at temperatures between 80° and 120° Fahrenheit. It's killed by chlorination and other disinfecting routines, but the bacteria can grow into mats that create hard-to-dislodge sludge inside pipes, Edens said.
""One of the things that we typically recommend in buildings that have been disused is flushing,"" he said.
""That can be as simple as turning the faucet on. Let cold or hot water course through the system. Keep that water moving.""
Legionella is not the only risk, by the way. ""There's lots of different waterborne pathogens,"" Edens said. ""There are certainly other bugs out there.""
The CDC warns about them on its website.
""These can include other microbial hazards, such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, changes in water chemistry that lead to corrosion, leaching of metals (such as lead) into stagnant water, disinfection by-products, and sewer gases that enter buildings through dry sanitary sewer drain traps,"" it says."

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. 
 (CNN)The sudden and deadly appearance of Covid-19 has shaken our nations around the world to their core. Governments were caught by surprise, unprepared to battle a pandemic within their own borders. But here's the thing: We in the conservation community weren't surprised at all. 
For years we've been warning that human destruction of wild ecosystems is upsetting nature's delicate balance and putting wildlife -- and humans -- at risk, while leading to dangerous and potentially irreversible climate change. Sadly, it's humanity's mistreatment of nature that has brought the devastation that we now see as a result of Covid-19. 
Scientists are working to contain the spread of the virus, and will likely find a cure or a vaccine. But what then? The global pandemic has brought the world to its collective knees, and when we all can finally get up, we'll need to make some big changes in the way we live on this planet, our only home. 
My career in science has been focused on studying and conserving gorillas. Our efforts in Rwanda to protect the ""gorillas in the mist,"" made famous by our founder and namesake Dian Fossey, have contributed to a rare conservation success story. Dian thought mountain gorillas would be extinct by the year 2000, but instead, they are coming back from the brink, with their numbers slowly but steadily growing over the past three decades. 
With just over 1,000 mountain gorillas remaining on the planet, they remain at risk and are a conservation dependent species. However, their story clearly shows that through effective governmental leadership, on-the-ground partnership, and community-based initiatives to improve quality of life for people living nearby, we can change the tide for a species on the brink of extinction -- and for the planet. 
In addition to our field operations in Rwanda, we work to conserve critically endangered Grauer's gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Unlike their cousin, the mountain gorilla, Grauer's numbers are decreasing rapidly. By 2015, an estimated 77% of Grauer's gorillas were lost in two decades, primarily as a result of poaching tied to the often illegal trade in conflict minerals used in small electronics, like cellular phones. These gorillas' population plummeted from 16,900 individuals to just approximately 3,800, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. What happens if gorillas disappear from this complex ecosystem? 
Gorillas inhabit the Congo basin, the second largest tropical rainforest in the world. It stretches across six countries, from the DRC in the east all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. At the Fossey Fund, we are working with local communities to protect 1,300 square kilometers of this forest and its inhabitants. We need the forests of the Congo basin and other tropical areas to remain intact and healthy -- not just for wildlife, but for humanity's sake. They serve as the ""lungs"" of our planet, by taking in carbon dioxide (tropical forests absorb roughly 14% of human caused carbon emissions) and releasing oxygen. However, recent studies show the Congo basin forests are losing their ability to absorb carbon, likely a result of decreased growth from increasing drought and heat. To put it simply, climate change is now affecting our best natural defense against climate change. 
This makes gorillas, and the thousands of other species that live in these forests, even more important. They play a critical role in maintaining the health of these ecosystems. Think of gorillas as gardeners -- they spread seeds by eating, distribute fertilizer through defecating, and help shape plant communities through their foraging and nest building behaviors. 
Human exploitation of the earth's remaining wild places, like the Congo basin, is destroying habitats at an unprecedented rate. In 2017 alone, we lost 39 million acres of tropical rainforest -- the equivalent of 40 football fields each minute. We are also decimating wildlife populations, with more than one million species now threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. 
And there are serious effects on humans themselves. These forests are our best natural defense against climate change. And as Covid-19 has brought into stark relief, by destroying nature we are creating the perfect conditions for disease transmission. Ebola. Zika. West Nile. Lyme. HIV. These are all diseases that, like the novel coronavirus, existed in animal populations before they were able to successfully make the leap to humans. 
People-focused wildlife conservation provides one avenue to preserving wild spaces and stopping this animal-to-human disease ""jump."" For example, our work in the DRC provides jobs, education and increased access to food resources, raising the standard of living for Congolese families. This in turn protects gorillas, along with the plants, animals and insects that share their habitat. It keeps the forest ecosystems of central Africa intact and pristine, ensuring that the trees retain their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, slowing climate change and protecting us all. 
Covid-19 has made abundantly clear that our assault on the world's biodiversity is also an assault on ourselves. It has proven that we can no longer afford to dismiss the problems scientists and conservationists uncover in faraway places. As forests are destroyed, people and wildlife increasingly come into contact; as the commercial wildlife trade expands, the crossover of diseases from animals to people occurs. 
We simply must take better care of the natural world. Healthy ecosystems are some of our best defenses against the challenges climate change is bringing. 
In the past, it has seemed a herculean effort to effect the major changes that are needed to address the underlying causes of environmental destruction, from poverty to excessive consumerism. However, I believe Covid-19 has taught us some important lessons. We have witnessed a global mobilization in the fight against this virus. We've seen the research community focus intensive efforts and resources on vaccines and therapies; we've seen industry adapt manufacturing capabilities to produce needed medical equipment and supplies, or to adopt teleworking practices that enable workers to socially distance; and we've seen individuals and families make personal sacrifices for the greater good. We're also seeing nature's ability to heal itself, as noticeably clearer skies and waterways emerged in a relatively short period of time, as human activities slowed dramatically under social distancing and shelter-in-place protocols. 
We can learn from this experience. We can choose to return to ""normal,"" or we can use this break to rethink the way we collectively prioritize our health, safety and wellbeing. We can make individual choices to buy sustainable products, recycle, and walk or bike rather than drive. We can make choices as a society to elect leaders who are informed by science and reason, rather than hunches or ideology. We can bring the resources of governments, industry and academia to bear to prevent the next deadly virus from emerging. 
We need to muster the political will to scale people-focused conservation to protect broader swaths of habitat worldwide. The natural world is trying to send us a message, but we need to listen.
The world's response to coronavirus has demonstrated that we can do big things if we work together. Let's learn from this hard lesson our planet is teaching us and start working to heal our forests, our planet and ourselves."

The study was published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It follows a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine that also showed the drug doesn't fight the virus. 
Even before these reports were published, the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health issued warnings about using the drugs for coronavirus patients. 
In the most recent study, researchers at the University at Albany looked at 1,438 patients with coronavirus who were admitted to 25 New York City area hospitals. After statistical adjustments, the death rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine was similar to those who did not take the drug. The death rate for those taking hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, was also similar. 
However, the patients who took the drug combination were more than twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest during the course of the study. Heart issues are a known side effect of hydroxychloroquine. 
""The big takeaway for me from this study is that it's very consistent with the FDA and NIH guidelines that came out in April,"" said one of the study's senior authors, David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany. ""When deciding on public health interventions and treatments for Covid-19 or any other disease, it's really important to follow the data and follow the science and make sure decisions are being made on the highest quality data possible."" 
This study likely won't be the last word on the drugs. Researchers at the University of Washington, New York University and other centers are still testing the drug in patients. 
In the clinical trials, coronavirus patients are randomly assigned to take the drugs or to take placebos, which have no effect, and then the death rates between the two groups will compared. These types of studies are considered the most reliable.
Trump's enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine 
Starting in mid-March, President Trump became a frequent cheerleader for hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and other diseases and the antibiotic azithromycin, often sold under the brand name Zithromax, or as a""Z-pack."" 
He promoted the drugs nearly 50 times, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not. 
""HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,"" Trump tweeted on March 21. 
Fox News frequently echoed Trump, but both the network and the president quieted down about the drugs once studies started showing they didn't work and possibly could hurt. 
No difference in death rates 
Trump's enthusiasm for the drugs was based on a French study of 20 patients in March that showed the drugs might work against the virus. That study was criticized for poor methodology, with experts calling it ""pathetic"" and ""a complete failure."" 
The medical society that published that study later said the study ""does not meet the Society's expected standard."" 
But the study was enough to excite Trump, and enough to excite doctors, who were free to prescribe the drugs because they're both already on the market to treat patients with other illnesses. 
The latest study in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at the medical records of 18% of all coronavirus patients hospitalized in the New York City area from March 15 to March 28. 
In this group, doctors prescribed both drugs to 735 patients, just hydroxychloroquine to 271 patients, just azithromycin to 211 patients and neither drug to 221 patients. 
They found that those taking hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with the antibiotic, were sicker than other patients to begin with and as time went on had a higher death rate. However, once the researchers statistically adjusted for the fact that the patients who took the drugs were sicker to start with, there was no statistical significance between the two death rates. 
Overall, the patients had a 20% death rate. 
The patients in the study were in the hospital, and other research teams are studying whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus infection or slow it down in the beginning stages of the disease.

The pushback underscores how House Democratic leaders are being attacked on all sides over the legislation -- by congressional Republicans, who have dismissed the legislation as an liberal wish list, as well as within their own ranks by both progressives and moderates. 
Despite the criticism from both progressives and moderates, House Democrats leaders have expressed confidence that the package will pass the House on Friday. It is not expected to be taken up by the Senate, however, due to Republican opposition. 
Progressives have expressed frustration that the bill does not go far enough to provide aid to Americans dealing with economic fallout, while some moderates are voicing concern over the massive price tag of the plan and the fact that it does not have widespread bipartisan support. 
Freshman Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn, a moderate who flipped an Oklahoma House seat from red to blue in 2018, strongly criticized the Democratic leadership's $3 trillion coronavirus response bill on Thursday, saying that she won't vote for it.
""Messaging bills without bipartisan support are a disservice to the American people, especially during a time of crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship, this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most.""
Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman from Michigan in a swing district, told CNN on Thursday that she has ""concerns"" with the $3 trillion price tag and said ""I'm undecided"" on whether she will vote for the plan on Friday. 
Slotkin said that she's trying to weigh ""the positives for my district against some of the negatives."" 
""What I wanted to see in this package is sticking to the very specific emergency need that the country has, and so I feel like there are a lot of things that I pushed for, and I believe in, especially money for our cities and towns. There's money for testing, like really critical things, and then there are some things that I don't feel like had to be in the bill, and what I'm trying to decide is does the net positive outweigh that negative,"" she said. 
Moderate freshmen Democrats like Horn and Slotkin represent the kind of frontline, battleground districts that will be heavily contested in the fall as Republicans try to win back the House majority they lost to Democrats in 2018. 
The voices of these vulnerable Democrats carry outsized influence within the House Democratic caucus with Democratic leaders recognizing the importance of holding onto those seats to maintain their majority. 
Pelosi defended the bill against attacks that it is partisan during a press conference on Thursday, saying, ""We're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation."" 
Congressional Republicans have argued that it is too early to pass another far-reaching measure and have instead urged waiting to see what the impact will be of the already-enacted relief packages so far. 
And while GOP leaders and the White House oppose the Democratic plan, at least one House Republican intends to vote for the bill: Rep. Pete King. 
The New York Republican plans to vote for the measure, according to his spokesman Kevin Fogarty."

 (CNN)Death lies ahead for all of us, preceded by a catastrophe or two along the way for many of us. Close calls can put the fragility of our lives into high relief, making our daily existence all the more meaningful. But this grueling slog of a pandemic strains the limits of normal resilience. And allowing your anxiety to peak can result in serious health consequences. 
The novel coronavirus pandemic can make it seem impossible to look away from the storm on the horizon. And what a monster it is: Covid-19's first wave is building into a tsunami threatening a growing number of states. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the nation, says we could reach 100,000 cases dailynationwide. In these circumstances, rising stress levels are inevitable. Covid-19 has already ""infected"" our minds whether or not it ever enters our bodies. Now's the time to work methodically on treating your pandemic brain.
The onrush of critical Covid-19 cases into our hospitals is of course the biggest single problem the nation faces. But for many individuals with no trace of the virus in their bodies, pandemic stress reactions are also tipping the scales toward medical catastrophe. 
I'm a doctor who deals exclusively in the world of life-changing injuries, working at a large Atlanta hospital treating patients from throughout the southeastern US and beyond. 
It's not uncommon that headlines in the news are soon reflected in the folks coming through our doors, whether a scooter craze resulting in head injuries, or a mass shooting's victims or, certainly, a rapidly spreading infectious disease. But it takes a global event like this to land such a collection of stress-related consequences at one particular hospital or with one particular doctor. 
I'm used to patients reporting particularly stressful events happening at the time of the heart attacks or strokes that land them in my care. We know there's a clear link between stress, anxiety and your cardiovascular health. Now they're reporting business closures. 
I'm seeing anxiety managed with alcohol or drugs become cardiac arrest. I'm also seeing delayed medical care with disabling consequences and reckless behaviors (another unhealthy response to stress) resulting in life-altering injury. 
For every person whose stress rises to the level that they've suffered a heart attack or stroke, there are many more people who simply experience a barely perceptible sustained increase in blood pressure or a tiny uptick in inflammatory biomarkers circulating in the bloodstream. In time, there may be consequences.
I can't imagine a set of prior life experiences that could fully inoculate one from worry. In any given week I see families through a loved one's twilight states of unconsciousness and semiconsciousness, facilitating deliberations over when to push forward and when it may be time to let go. 
After being saturated with such problems daily for a decade now, you might assume a global pandemic couldn't rock my psyche much in the way of life or death fear. You'd be wrong. None of us were ready for this.
Anxiety is natural, but keeping your brain constantly plugged into a smartphone -- a handheld conduit to all the world's problems -- is decidedly unnatural. ""Doomscrolling"" makes 2020's anxieties synthetically supercharged.
Even with mask-wearing and avoiding crowds it's not fully in our control when we will contract Covid-19. It's certainly not up to us how we will fare when it takes hold. 
But we have a level of control over the way we react to this new reality, where we direct our attention and for how long, and how deliberately we manage our moments. Of course, it doesn't help that just as anxiety and depression are spiking, professional help is harder than ever to access. (Though the national suicide prevention lifeline is always available to connect people to the care they need. If you need this service, call 1-800-273-8255).
Now don't get me wrong, just because you worry about Covid-19 does not mean you have a stroke coming around the corner. Underlying risk factors are typically required to see stress translate into a major cardiovascular event. At the same time, many adults do have some risk factors, often unbeknownst to them. 
Situational factors -- say the events of a pandemic or world war -- are often going to be at play in whether any particular person's stroke or heart attack happens on one given day versus another. And we're seeing a whole lot more of these health incidents now because of the pandemic.
Washington Post data analysts pored over three months of pandemic data from five states to determine that there were 8,300 more cardiovascular disease related deaths than expected in those states. 
The deaths aren't from Covid-19 directly, but many were likely due to delayed care, and perhaps in some cases, they were the result of pandemic stress, similar to my own clinical observations. 
Last week the Journal of the American Medical Association also published a data analysis suggesting that Covid-19 death counts significantly underreport the true number of deaths related to the pandemic through health impacts like these. 
For every pandemic-stress related death, there are many more survivors with near-death experiences, like the patients I treat.
No doctor can prescribe that your business will breeze through what's happening, or that you don't lose your insurance or fall victim to the many other of the factors making lives go haywire right now. I can't tell you to make sure no one in your family ends up in the hospital for weeks, separated and suffering. 
Still, there are some things we can do to try to maintain our physical and mental well-being while accepting that no, everything isn't alright. Doing what we can to manage our personal pandemic stress reactions, while accepting more of what we can't change, will be one key to our survival.
The treatment I'd prescribe calls for conscious disconnection, then elective reconnection to what's really important in your life. Manage untoward events where you realistically can do so. Let the rest wash overboard. Go data dry for a day. Build from there.
As everything moves online -- our work lives, social lives, and more of our basic services, including our health care -- this may seem like an impossible goal. Use some of the growing assortment of tools to help you lessen your screen time and protect all the screen-free time you can wring out of your days and weeks. 
I'm trying to stick to the prescription myself, increasingly disconnecting for much of the day during weekends and hoping to continue. 
Does it sound trite to recommend a hobby too? Doesn't it also sound a little underwhelming to recommend exercise and a heart-healthy diet -- especially following a heart attack? 
The treatment works, however low-tech it may be. The same exercise and diet that can help your heart can also help calm your pandemic brain.
Manage your consumption of 2020's malignant political scene in the same way that you attempt to limit your dessert intake. We can't turn away from our democracy at these critical moments. But engage judiciously. I teach families that they have to take time for and care for themselves in order to care for their loved one. The same can be said when caring for our troubled democracy. 
It's appropriate to grieve the world and the innocence we've lost. And we should not underestimate the lasting effects of this stress on our health. The ripple effects here aren't a mere ""butterfly effect."" The pandemic is more of a charging hippopotamus effect. Intentionally coping with and managing the unfortunate reality, while dodging the hippo as best we can, just became part of the job description for every adult. 
Survival is in question now, but in reality, that has always been the case. The ways we interact and how we do business are changing, much of it for the long term. But life has always been subject to change. Some degree of acceptance of these facts, if you can muster it, will help lower your anxiety. 
Puzzles, painting, hikes, kayaking, adopting a dog, games with friends online -- find whatever works to move your gaze off the storm on the horizon. For those who can afford camping trips and are boosting the RV sales around the country, that's a great response. Same with the home exercise equipment, so long as you use it! You've got to be deliberate in adding new social and physical routines to your weekly mix. 
What kept you healthy in 2019 won't be good enough for the rest of 2020. So maybe add in some meditation or try mindfulness exercises. I'm not a practitioner, but agree it sounds like a good idea (I'd rather weed the garden). Whatever new activities you pick, be prepared and willing to change it up. Change is about the only thing we can count on."

It should be an ordinary sight, but father of six Jamie Chambers says, in the age of Covid-19, scenes like this keep him up at night.
""We all want it to be normal, we all want our regular lives back and I have nothing but sympathy and empathy for people who do, but we're not living in normal times,"" he told CNN. ""And that's the thing, people are just choosing to live as if it is, until it's impossible to ignore.""
The number of quarantines since schools in Woodstock and the rest of Cherokee County opened last week is just that -- impossible to ignore. At least 478 students and teachers were asked to quarantine after possible exposure to Covid-19 in the first five days of classes. By early Tuesday, that number had swelled to 925 students and staff. Nearly one-third of the district's schools -- which teach 30,000 students from elementary to high -- have been impacted.
Chambers, who fears the coronavirus will spread throughout the area, which is about 30 minutes north of Atlanta, says he saw this coming. He, along with other district parents, received a letter from Cherokee County School Superintendent Brian Hightower in mid-July announcing a 77-page reopening plan. 
""One day later it was voted on, with limited opportunity for the public to participate,"" Chambers said of the vote, which was limited to those who were able to show up last-minute. ""When the committee that created the reopening plan was created there were no teachers on it and teachers were not given a chance to review it before it was published for the public.""
Chambers became a well-known local activist after he wrote an open letter to the superintendent blasting the reopening plan.
""I see little evidence that guidelines from (the US Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health) were a guiding factor in creating these policies. In fact, your plan seems to repeatedly soften or ignore their recommendations altogether while seeming to envision a 'best case scenario' when it comes to young people complying with these changing rules and the teachers' ability to monitor and enforce them,"" wrote Chambers, a game designer.
The plan now in place in schools means students do not social distance and adults do not wear facial coverings. Chambers believes students going in-person are at risk and is keeping his 10-year-old and 4-year-old at home. 
CNN reached out to Superintendent Hightower, who declined an interview. The school district's chief communications officer, Barbara P. Jacoby, said: ""(O)ur communications efforts are focused on directly communicating with parents.""
On Tuesday, Hightower told parents Etowah High School in Woodstock would have close to in-person learning from the end of the day until at least August 31. There have been 14 positive coronavirus cases at the school, he said, with tests pending for another 15 students. Some 294 students and staff have been asked to quarantine.
Hightower urged people to social distance and wear masks. ""As your Superintendent, I wear a mask whenever I cannot social distance. We know all parents do not believe the scientific research that indicates masks are beneficial, but I believe it and see masks as an important measure to help us keep schools open,"" he wrote to parents. 
Requiring masks is a decision that is being left up to individual schools in Cherokee County. Across Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has encouraged mask-wearing but ruled out any mandates and says he supports local decision-making.
A little north of Woodstock, Brandy Heath thought that sending her fourth and sixth graders back into classrooms at Freedom Middle and Liberty Elementary in Canton was definitely the better option for their learning. 
""I sent my son to face-to-face learning because, as any parent knows, school is the best place for our children. Their teachers are educated, and they can teach things to our kids that we can't,"" she told CNN.
""However, the second day of school my son said to me, 'Mom, I'm not feeling safe. We're not social distancing, there's no precautions being taken to keep us safe,'"" Heath told CNN of her fourth grader.
As soon as she heard that, Heath, who says she is immuno-compromised, pulled her kids back home for distance learning. 
""We expected the Cherokee County School District to keep our kids safe. To take precautions that ensure their safety. And it's not being done,"" she said.
Back on the playground in Woodstock, Jamie Chambers said he feels sometimes like he's fighting a losing battle. In this deeply conservative part of Georgia, he says politics continue to be put before science, with even some school officials telling staff that they believe the coronavirus is a hoax, he said.
Some of the parents at the park appeared less concerned about the virus. 
""I don't regret sending my kids to school,"" the mother of a fourth and fifth grader, who declined to give her name, told CNN. ""They're either going to get the virus in school or outside of school, might as well send them back."""

A cursory search for a coronavirus mask or a surgical mask turns up lots of options, but they're either sold out and expected to be out of stock for weeks or they are exceptionally costly. A pack of 100 disposable masks, for instance, has about quadrupled in price over the last few weeks to $15, Wired reported.  Some bulk foods appear difficult to purchase. In Italy which is suffering through the largest European outbreak hand sanitizer prices have reportedly skyrocketed online.
It's worth noting masks aren't even recommended unless you're actively coughing/sneezing or if you're taking care of someone who is sick. Experts do recommend washing your hands frequently and washing your hands correctly and avoiding touching your face. 
The rush to purchase these supplies has appeared in lockstep with the stress that's overtaken people in the U.S. as the virus continues to spread throughout the world. However, an expert told Mashable that this doesn't necessarily mean people are panicking. In some ways, stocking up is a method of taking control.
""People wanting to be proactive about their well-being is not necessarily indicative of panic,"" said Dr. Samantha Penta, an assistant professor of emergency preparedness at the University at Albany's College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity.
Still, it can prove to be an unproductive cycle. Attempting to buy supplies online, if what you're after has already been pillaged, can ramp up anxiety. The world which has 150 million Prime users relies heavily on Amazon. It's odd and discomforting to see it without products. Not to mention, it's a little scary to even feel the need to parse through emergency supplies in the first place.

Amazon, meanwhile, said it's working to stop merchants from taking advantage of the crisis.
""There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,"" an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. ""We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers. We continue to actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.""
Amazon previously sent an email warning merchants about masks that were not in compliance with pricing policies, according to Wired. 
No doubt, it's a frightening time. There have to date been more than 83,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. 
""Do not mistake me: I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, on Wednesday. ""Every scenario is still on the table.""
Even in this time of potential crisis, some folks are trying to capitalize on the virus by selling surprisingly lighthearted merch. Asthe Vergepointed out, there are coronavirus shirts all over Amazon that look like something you'd get off a New Jersey boardwalk. The t-shirts feature pretty tasteless jokes from everything about Corona beer to ""keep calm and resist coronavirus.""

Worse still, Amazon like just about anywhere online is full of information of questionable validity. It has had to remove more than 1 million products that falsely claimed they were a coronavirus cure. People are also selling books making all kinds of unproven claims like Satan or biological warfare caused the outbreak, Business Insider reported. 
There have been all kinds of responses online, from these ""joking"" t-shirts to social media sites filled with worrying, if often questionable, information. 
""I think something thats important to drive home is that this is a consistently evolving situation,"" Penta said. ""Its just important to not fill the gaps with false information."" 
While the internet might be stressful during the coronavirus outbreak, experts have stressed it's not time for folks to panic.
""It's good to take precautions, but you don't have to live in fear."" Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon."

Two attendees and two individuals ""supporting the event"" tested positive, according to an official release from Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located. 
A spokesman for the party said the individuals tested positive upon arriving at the convention and were immediately sent home. In all, 792 Covid-19 tests were given to people who attended or provided support to the convention in Charlotte, the county said.
The city was originally going to host the entire Republican convention, but coronavirus-related concerns limited activities there to largely party business earlier this week rather than speeches, and much of the event was remote or held in Washington, DC.
""These individuals were immediately issued isolation instructions and any known close contacts were notified and issued quarantine instructions by Mecklenburg County Public Health,"" the county said.
Many Republicans, most prominently President Donald Trump, have downplayed the ongoing spread of coronavirus and disregarded the need for safety measures such as avoiding large crowds and wearing masks in an urge to return the country to normalcy. 
When he accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday evening at the White House, Trump appeared in front of an audience that was virtually entirely mask-less and attendees were sitting in close proximity to one another. And those who attended first lady Melania Trump's speech in the White House Rose Garden earlier this week were not required to get tested, a person who attended the speech has told CNN.
Trump had long insisted on holding a full, in-person convention in Charlotte as planned before the pandemic, only to back down following objections from the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who expressed concerns about spreading the virus at such a large event.
Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Friday the party had ""diligent safety protocols in place"" and tested all attendees both before and after they arrived in Charlotte.
""Out of roughly 1,000 tests administered, two RNC attendees, despite having negative tests prior to travel, and two Charlotte locals who planned to serve as event support staff tested positive upon arrival. All were sent home,"" Ahrens said.
North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Austin Cook, referring to news of the positive tests, said the decision to hold even a pared-down convention in Charlotte was a ""slap to the face to the Charlotte community and all North Carolinians.""
Earlier in the summer, the President and his campaign were forced to shelve plans to revive his trademark campaign rallies after an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was poorly attended due to virus concerns. Several members of Trump's campaign tested positive for the virus, as did several Secret Service agents who were present.
Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign event Friday night in New Hampshire, and WMUR reports that the event will adhere to a state requirement that masks are worn at scheduled gatherings of 100 people or more."

In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Woodland Hills, the e-commerce giant today opened its first Amazon Fresh supermarket, the first of seven Amazon Fresh that it plans to set up in California and Illinois in the coming weeks and months.
A blog post from James Helbling, the head of Amazon Fresh, notes that the store will open initially invitation-only, based emails it will be sending out to locals, from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. PT. It will update more on opening hours and capacity over time here.
You might be thinking to yourself, but Amazon already has Whole Foods and smaller Amazon Go stores? The idea here will be to build a new grocery store experience from the ground up targeting a different customer. Indeed, this is par for the course with all consumer packaged goods plays: own a wide variety of brands targeting all demographics, and you will own the space.
It’s also an essential part of the playbook for Amazon in its wider bid to compete more squarely against the likes of Walmart, which dominates the world of physical (and therefore, all) shopping in the US. Walmart was estimated to have about a 26% market share of grocery sales in the US, in what is still quite a fragmented market, according to this graphic from Statista. The data puts Amazon’s Whole Foods share at just 1.6%, although Amazon itself estimates that it is closer to about 4%, including its other channels, including online. Still pretty small, nevertheless.
While Whole Foods focuses mainly on organic and health foods (and has rightly earned the nickname “Whole Paycheck” because of how expensive a shopping trip can be there), and Go is smaller and about catering to early adopters with its no-human, all-automation, AI and camera approach, Amazon Fresh will bring in a bunch of recognised, mainstream big brands alongside Amazon’s own burgeoning own-label lines, along with a lot of pre-prepared items.
That’s not to say it won’t also be very tech-heavy. The store will have a new feature called the Amazon Dash Cart so that people can build lists of items before going into the store, and then use that to select and pay for things to cut waiting time to ring up and pay with a human cashier. And there will be Echo Show devices set up around the store to give people advice on where to find products. (But I don’t think they will be fully operational devices: ie no ability to change the music playing in the store through these… not yet at least.)
It will also offer free delivery to people who shop at the store, which essentially will also become a depot of sorts for the wider Amazon Fresh operation — which had been entirely online until now (and which had started to offer free delivery some time back to sharpen competition with the wide plethora of other grocery delivery options out in the market now).
By building the whole store from the ground up, it will give Amazon to integrate more tech into the experience more easily, too.
The arrival, spread, and persistent existence of the novel coronavirus has played out in a tricky way when it comes to physical stores. Depending on where you live, you will have different sets of regulations to comply with when shopping, which might range from requiring face masks or limiting entry or movement within stores, through to stores operating with other limitations and in some extreme cases not being opened at all.
Amazon said it plans to take its own set of guidelines into how the stores will be run, basing it on how Whole Foods has been working. Employees will have temperature checks daily; both workers and customers will have to wear face masks; it will offer free disposable masks to people who need one; and stores will be limited to a maximum capacity of 50%.
The opening of this store in LA should not come as a huge surprise to those who have been following the company’s moves: it has been slowly picking up large retail locations to develop them into Fresh depots for a while now, including sites in LA, but a number of other signals including hiring patterns have led many to guess that the bigger plan was to build them into retail operations.
The company has reportedly also been looking to develop physical grocery stores in other markets outside of the US as well. There have been rumors swirling for years now in the UK — which like the US has a pretty fragmented and somewhat tumultuous grocery industry, dominated in its case by Tesco — that Amazon has been eyeing up retail locations that have come up for sale as big retail chains have found themselves in financial dire straights.
That predicament, ironically, has been partly the result of the shift to people shopping online, on sites like (you guessed it) Amazon."

The event was set to have slipped under the wire having narrowly avoided a COVID-19-related shutdown two years in a row. A month later, however, its organizers reversed course, announcing the January show was going virtual. Disappointing, perhaps, but not surprising.
The past five months have seen one in-person show cancellation after another, from MWC to E3, from WWDC to Computex to our own Disrupt, which is going online-only for the first time. One major consumer electronics trade show, on the other hand, has long planned to buck that trend. On September 3, IFA will kick off in-person in Berlin. Though this years event will look dramatically different.
Usually, we have more than 40 halls serving IFA . This year, at the moment, we have two halls for the press conference with the stages, one exhibition hall, one press center hall and one hall for IFA Next and Shift Mobility, the organizations executive director Jens Heithecker explains on the phone from Germany. We will have around 170-180 exhibitors, compared to 2,300 last year.
Heithecker doesnt mask the melancholy in his voice when discussing this years version of the show. To be a little poetic, usually in the late summer, theres a special air in Berlin and you go out in the morning, you feel this air, he says. This year for me, the airs the same, but whenever I see the halls, the area of our exhibition site, its empty, more or less.
Ive attended IFA several times over the years, and have always been struck by the organizational chaos. Every tech trade show has some element of this, of course, but IFA opens itself up the public, filling the maze like halls of the Messe Berlin convention center with a peculiar mix of industry professionals and local families with small children. Its alternately amusing and maddening, depending on how much time you give yourself to get from point A to point B.
This years show has been designated IFA 2020 Special Edition. Its essentially a nice way of noting that the show will be significantly smaller than in years past. Heithecker notes that some 1,100 members of the press have registered for the show, all from a limited invite list. I was on the invite list as well, but, like many, simply opted not to go. Frankly, the idea of flying to German to stand inside an event hall with exhibitors and fellow journalists sounds far less appealing than following along from home.
Im sure my own sense of safety is colored by my home countrys less-than-ideal handling of the pandemic. But with 24.5 million global cases and 833,000 deaths to date from the virus, theres still cause for concern, as numbers continue to rise around the globe. Germany has, of course, largely done well in its own handling of the novel coronavirus, but theres cause for concern even there. With numbers rising, the country has put reopening plans on pause while other European countries like Norway have added German travelers to a quarantine list.
By end of March, we started to create our statistics on our own, to understand the situation a better way than in the public media only, says Heithecker. The rising number in Germany at least in the northern part of Germany is created mainly by the double number of tested people. This means the ratio of positively tested people is the same like before. So we will find more people by the situation, the general situation is not going worse in the northern part. We have more tested because the German government is fearing, at the moment, all the people coming back from their holidays in the south, especially, in the south of Europe. That’s the main reason at the moment that we are following so close all the figures every day.”
The nature of the limited guest list means that social distancing will be significantly easier for attendees to practice than they have been in past years, when members of the press have been elbowing small children out of the way in order to get a good show of the latest ASUS gaming laptop. Of course, simply having more space doesnt necessarily mean that guests will keep to the mask and social distance requirements (1.5 meters) that IFA posts.
We have so many additional people watching out for our attendees, that they will wear masks, that they will keep the distances, Heithecker explains. He adds that attendees will be removed from the premises for refusing to adhere to such social safety rules, but that such a move, understandably, is a last resort.
The organization notably pulled the plug on the Global Markets portion of the show, citing persistent travel restrictions prevent Asian companies from joining the live event. The event, launched in 2016 for OEMs/ODMs, retailers and distributors, drew a significant portion of exhibitions and attendees from Asian countries. In late June, Samsung announced that it would be pulling out of the show, opting instead for its own Unpacked event just ahead of IFA.
Heithecker believes that Samsungs decision was based on word from the hardware giants U.K. offices. Two months, three months ago, they couldn’t imagine that any journalist would attend IFA, he tells TechCrunch. And even if you told them, Hey, we have all the registrations already, they will come, they didn’t believe.
He adds that he thinks the company is essentially riding the shows presence to add views, but that Samsung will ultimately regret not directly taking part in the show. Samsung is doing the press conference in front of this years IFA, using the attention we create for the industry, for new products, using the power, the activity of IFA as well, even if they’re not inside our show, Heithecker says. We create this and we will bring the proof that whoever is attending or using our new platform, even for online presentations, will see a bigger impact and much more viewers and much more investment than if you do it on your own."

The already hot categories are proving to be even more appealing as companies look to technology amid the spread of a deadly and highly contagious virus.
Warehouses and fulfillment centers are, naturally, a big category for funding. Amazon, which has continued to operate as an essential service throughout the pandemic, has helped demonstrate the roles robots can play. It has also, unfortunately, provided some cautionary stories around transmission to human workers.
Fox Robotics is the latest startup to reap the benefits of the accelerated interest in the category. The Austin-based startup told TechCrunch this week that it has raised a $9 million Series A, led by Menlo Ventures. The latest round brings its total funding to date up to $13 million, with support from previous investors Eniac, Famiglia, SignalFire, Congruent, AME and Joe.
The companys value proposition is pretty clear. Fox builds self-driving forklifts it says are capable of increasing workplace productivity up to two to three times. Fox joins a glut of companies currently looking to automate the workplace, but the companys value proposition is in the manner of flexibility it’s able to provide over more fixed systems. And equally important, its much easier to integrate into existing warehouses.

“The market demand for warehouse automation is huge and growing. The future of warehouse automation isnt fixed conveyor systems that cost several hundred million dollars. Its mobile robots that are low-cost, flexible and can be deployed incrementally and quickly, CEO Charles DuHadway said in the announcement.
At the very least, I think theres a value in a system that lets companies ease into automation, versus more complex systems like the ones offered by companies like Berkshire Grey. Those can be far pricier and resource intensive, making them intimidating for smaller companies and those only beginning to test to the waters of automation for their back channels. And unlike some other solutions, it requires direct human supervision, though one employee is able to monitor multiple systems at once.

Fox says it has been working with some unnamed large logistics companies in pilot mode since last October. It says the funding will be used to ramp up production and meet current interest."

Not all spaces have been quite so lucky, in particular, lately we’ve seen a host of location-based virtual reality startups shut their doors.
Virtual reality arcades weren’t exactly crushing it pre-pandemic, the small industry was already a bit of a Hail Mary for the virtual reality market which has failed to push consumers to adopt headsets on their own and saw arcades as a way to warm up the general public to VR’s role in entertainment. Lackluster consumer interest and the throughput difficulties associated with quickly moving users through experiences were among their biggest challenges facing VR arcades.
This week following a report from Protocol, Apple confirmed its acquisition of Spaces, a virtual reality arcade startup which had been forced to close its in-person arcades amid COVID and had attempted a pivot to creating virtual environments for video chat software. An Apple acquisition is hardly a mark of failure, but it is unlikely that the company has any interest in reviving the startup’s arcade business.
Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the US subsidiary of Sandbox VR had filed for bankruptcy. Sandbox VR has raised quite a bit of money on the promise that they could revamp several industries at once. The idea was that mall operators on the decline would give great deals to some of these startups to set up physical storefronts as a loss leader to bring in a younger generation of consumers, while they could capitalize on mixed reality social media video to bring a level of viral growth to their VR offerings.
In July, UploadVR discovered documents that suggested Disney had terminated the lease of virtual reality startup The Void’s Downtown Disney location following months of COVID-related closures.
It was impossible to forecast the current pandemic when many of these investments were being made, but virtual reality arcades had already shown they were far from a sure bet. In late 2018, IMAX shut the doors of the last of its seven virtual reality arcades after investing tens of millions into its VR efforts.
With the future of in-person entertainment unclear, the question is whether virtual reality arcades have any chance of a rebound.
The fact is many of these startups were pushing up against current realities on multiple fronts and were attempting to seriously shift the landscape of 21st century digital entertainment, attempts that seemed daunting from the start.
As massive movie theater chains struggle to see how the pandemic will affect their industries in the long-term, it isn’t surprising that many of these startups have failed to see a light at the end of the tunnel and have shut down operations or been sold off. I suspect investors will be reluctant to back new efforts in this space and that the time horizon of COVID-19 will force current entrants towards pivots that look dramatically different from pre-COVID era business models. (One caveat is that the VR arcade market certainly looks differently in the United States compared to markets in countries like China and Japan where virtual reality arcades seem to fit a bit more snugly into popular gaming culture.)
If VR arcades survive or are reborn, it will be due to some pretty massive shifts in consumer behavior and VR adoption.
Virtual reality, as an industry, is in a tough spot. In the United States, it’s essentially only Facebook keeping the space alive in a meaningful way and while the company seems to be barreling ahead in its efforts to build a mainstream future for the technology on its own terms. Earlier this summer, Facebook announced that it was pulling its top-selling title Beat Saber from arcades for good by August. Since the acquisition of Oculus back in 2014, the ecosystem that sprang up around Facebook’s VR efforts has receded meaningfully leaving the company in a lonely position once again."

Who knew that would ever happen? The race to secure PPE, ventilators, minor things like food, was and still is, an enormous issue. But perhaps, predictably, the world of ‘supply chain software’ could use some updating. Most of the platforms are deployed empty and require the client to populate them with their own data or bring their own data. The UIs can be outdated and still have to be juggled with manual and offline workflows. So startups working in this space are now attracting some timely attention.
Thus, Craft, the enterprise intelligence company, today announces that it has closed a $10 million Series A financing to build what it characterizes as a ‘supply chain intelligence platform’. With the new funding, Craft will expand its offices in San Francisco, London, and Minsk, and grow remote teams across engineering, sales, marketing and operations in North America and Europe.
It competes with some large incumbents such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Bureau van Dijk, Thomson Reuters . These are traditional data providers focused primarily on providing financial data about public companies, rather than real-time data from data sources such as operating metrics, human capital, and risk metrics.
The idea is to allow companies to monitor and optimize their supply chain and enterprise systems. The financing was led by High Alpha Capital, alongside Greycroft. Craft also has some high-flying Angel investors including Sam Palmisano, chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise and former CEO and chairman of IBM; Jim Moffatt, former CEO of Deloitte Consulting; Frederic Kerrest, executive vice-chairman, COO and co-founder of Okta; and Uncork Capital which previously led Crafts Seed financing. High Alpha Partner, Kristian Andersen, is joining Crafts Board of Directors.
The problem Craft is attacking is a lack of visibility into complex global supply chains. For obvious reasons, COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains which tended to reveal a lot of risks, structural weaknesses across industries and a lack of intelligence about how its all holding together. Crafts solution is a proprietary data platform, API, and portal that integrates into existing enterprise workflows.
While many business intelligence products require clients to bring their own data, Crafts data platform comes pre-deployed with data from thousands of financial and alternative sources, such as 300+ data points that are refreshed using both Machine Learning and human validation.

Count Atlassian in that camp, as it provides a suite of tools focused on working smarter in a digital context.
At a time when many employees are working from home, Atlassians product approach sounds like a recipe for a smash hit. But in its latest earnings report, the company detailed slowing growth, not the acceleration we might expect. Looking ahead, its predicting more of the same — at least for the short term.
Part of the reason for that — beyond some small-business customers, hit by hard times, moving to its new free tier introduced last March — is the pain associated with moving customers off of older license revenue to more predictable subscription revenue. The company has shown that it is willing to sacrifice short-term growth to accelerate that transition.
We sat down with Atlassian CRO Cameron Deatsch to talk about some of the challenges his company is facing as it navigates through these crazy times. Deatsch pointed out that in spite of the turbulence, and the push to subscriptions, Atlassian is well-positioned with plenty of cash on hand and the ability to make strategic acquisitions when needed, while continuing to expand the recurring-revenue slice of its revenue pie.
Deatsch told us that Atlassian could not fully escape the pandemic’s impact on business, especially in April and May when many companies felt it. His company saw the biggest impact from smaller businesses, which cut back, moved to a free tier, or in some cases closed their doors. There was no getting away from the market chop that SMBs took during the early stages of COVID, and he said it had an impact on Atlassians new customer numbers.

Still, the company believes it will recover from the slow down in new customers, especially as it begins to convert a percentage of its new, free-tier users to paid users down the road. For this quarter it only translated into around 3000 new customers, but Deatsch didn’t seem concerned. “The customer numbers were off, but the overall financials were pretty strong coming out of [fiscal] Q4 if you looked at it. But also the number of people who are trying our products now because of the free tier is way up. We saw a step change when we launched free,” he said."

On one level, its surge to the top can be summed up in three words: “It just works.” However, that doesn’t mean Zoom’s user experience is perfect — in fact, far from it.
With the help of Built for Mars founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we dive deeper into the user experience of Zoom on Mac, highlighting five UX fails and how to fix them. More broadly, we discuss how to design for “empty states,” why asking “copy to clipboard” requests are problematic and other issues.
This is an incredibly simple rule, yet youd be surprised how often software and websites leave users scratching their heads trying to figure what they’re expected to do next. Clear signposting and contextual user prompts are key.
The fail: In Zoom, as soon as you create a meeting, youre sat in an empty meeting room on your own. This sucks, because obviously you want to invite people in. Otherwise, why are you using Zoom? Another problem here is that the next action is hidden in a busy menu with other actions you probably never or rarely use.
The fix: Once youve created a meeting (not joined, but created), Zoom should prompt and signpost you how to add people. Sure, have a skip option. But it needs some way of saying Okay, do this next.”
Steve O’Hear: Not pointing to the next action seems to be quite a common fail, why do you think this is? If I had to guess, product developers become too close to a product and develop a mindset that assumes too much prior knowledge and where the obvious blurs with the nonobvious?"

Now, the company is making a more literal one: decamping from its Palo Alto headquarters to Denver, Colorado.
The decision to relocate its Palo Alto headquarters, first reported by the Denver Business Journal, comes after the company filed SEC paperwork last month to take the company public. The most recent whispers say Palantir is aiming for a direct listing in late September rather than a traditional IPO.
While its chief executive’s vocal complaints about a cultural mismatch played a role in Palantir’s decision to relocate its main office away from the Bay Area, cost of living improvements and a proximity to clients in the center of the country also factored into the decision.
For a company with around 2,500 employees, Palantir maintains a surprising array of office locations, both in the U.S. and internationally. Palantir’s Palo Alto office will likely remain a hub for its developers and software engineers. The company’s New York and London offices currently house a large portion of its product development work.
Palantir CEO Alex Karp announced plans to move the company’s headquarters away from California in an Axios interview back in May.
“We haven’t picked a place yet, but it’s going to be closer to the East Coast than the West Coast,” Karp said, adding that Colorado would be his guess for where the headquarters would land.
In the same interview, Karp railed against what he called Silicon Valley’s “monoculture,” a reference to left-leaning views that generally characterize both Bay Area culture and the company’s vocal critics.
While Silicon Valley is far from monocultural by any traditional measure, Karp cites an “increasing intolerance” in the region particularly for the company’s own federal defense work. Palantir continued to seek contracts with federal law enforcement agencies, even as some tech companies dropped or declined to pursue them.
Palantir’s work supplying software for ICE’s deportation efforts is a particular nexus of controversy. “… It’s a de minimis part of our work, finding people in our country who are undocumented, but it’s a legitimate, complex issue,” Karp told CNBC in Davos earlier this year.
Google famously declined to renew a Pentagon contract known as Project Maven in 2018 after an internal backlash. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Palantir and one of the Trump administration’s closest allies in tech, slammed Google’s decision as “very problematic.”
All Palantir employees not currently working with customers in the field are working from home with no set plan to return to the office at this time. Karp, a frequent critic of Silicon Valley’s regional myopia, currently runs the company from his home in the libertarian enclave of New Hampshire.
“I’m pretty happy outside the monoculture in New Hampshire and I like living free here,” Karp told Axios, referencing the state’s motto “Live free or die.”"

Eren Bali, co-founder CEO of Carbon Health, and Othman Laraki, founder and CEO of Color, will join us on our virtual stage during Disrupt, which runs September 14-18 this year. Bali’s Carbon Health is a startup focused on creating a new standard for primary and urgent care, using modern clinics equipped with smart technology, as well as remote healthcare devices to enable a high standard of distanced clinical practice. Laraki’s Color, meanwhile, has adapted its population genomics platform and added COVID-19 testing as a core capability, with an eye to establishing and sharing best practices for high-volume diagnostics.
We’ll talk about how healthcare has changed since the advent of the pandemic, and what it means for people looking to ensure that their primary care continues to be offered at a high level without other problems falling through the cracks. We’ll also discuss Color’s experience working with the city of San Francisco to roll out its in-person testing capabilities, including providing crucial testing resources for primary care workers. We’ll also look ahead to what kind of challenges we’re still likely to face before the pandemic is over, and how it will change how we approach community and individual care for decades to come.
Both Carbon Health and Color are at the frontlines of COVID-19 testing during an unparalleled national and global emergency, and their insight will be invaluable for getting a sense of what’s going right and what’s going wrong with testing in the U.S., and where we go from here. You won’t want to miss the perspectives that these two can offer.

The AV space has always faced its share of regulatory and development hurdles, but this year brought a new set of hurdles with the COVID-19 pandemic.
At TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility, we’ll hear from Cruise, Lyft, Nuro and Aurora about where they’re at in their respective journeys to public deployment and how they’ve navigated the year.
Cruise Director of Government Affairs Prashanthi Raman 
Earlier this year, before the world blew up, Cruise received a permit in California to begin transporting passengers. Cruise also began focusing more on hardware earlier this year. That all came after Cruise had already scrapped its plans to launch a robotaxi service in 2019. In the throws of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cruise laid off 8% of its workforce in May in an attempt to cut costs. As part of the restructuring, Cruise said it would double down on its engineering efforts.
Meanwhile, Cruise still has its eyes set on public deployment, which is where the expertise of Raman comes in. It’s her job to help Cruise navigate the murky regulatory waters of autonomous vehicles.
Nuro Chief Legal &amp; Policy Officer David Estrada 
Nuro, an autonomous delivery startup, takes a slightly different approach to autonomous vehicles. Instead of transporting people, Nuro transports goods. In April, Nuro received a permit to begin driverless testing in California. The startup, which raised $940 million from SoftBank’s Vision Fund last year, aims to deliver groceries and other goods to customers at scale.
Estrada, who previously led legal and policy operations at Bird and government relations at Lyft, is no stranger to playing ball with regulatory agencies. It’s up to him to ensure Nuro gains the trust of the public by proving the company’s commitment to safety and the law.
Lyft Self-Driving Platform Director Jody Kelman
Lyft first began testing its autonomous vehicles in California in late 2018. The company had to pause those operations earlier this year as a result of the pandemic, but resumed testing in late June.
That same month, Lyft began using data from its ride-hailing app to build 3D maps, better understand human driving patterns and improve simulation tests for the company’s autonomous vehicle program.
As part of Lyft’s go-to-market strategy, it has partnered with a number of companies. A key partner for Lyft has been Aptiv, which as of February, provided 100,000 paid rides on the Lyft app.
“Weve got something here, Kelman said at the time to TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec. “This is really a blueprint for what future mobility partnerships can look like.”
Aurora Senior Manager of Government Relations Melissa Froelich
Aurora, which launched back in 2017, had been developing a full-stack solution for self-driving vehicles that prioritized robotaxis. That changed in October 2019, when Aurora began focusing more on trucks and logistics and declared trucks would be the company’s first commercial product.
Trucking comes with its own bag of worms, but folks seem to believe that AV trucking has a clearer path to profitability. In July, Aurora expanded into Texas to test commercial routes. At TC Sessions: Mobility, Froelich will discuss how Aurora is navigating the autonomous trucking space and the challenges it faces.

The firm expects the massive changes in e-commerce, healthcare, logistics, and urban infrastructure to remain in place for an extended period of time and is urging investors to rethink their approaches to each as a result.
“It really ties into the mandate that we have in thematic investing,” said Leon Pedersen, the head of Thematic Investments at CPPIB.
There was a realization at the firm that structural changes were happening and that there was value for the fund manager in ensuring that the changes were being addressed across its broad investment portfolio. “We have a long term mandate and we have a long term investment horizon so we can afford to think long term in our investment outlook,” Pedersen said.
The Thematic Investments group within CPPIB will make mid-cap, small-cap and private investments in companies that reflect the firm’s long term theses, according to Pedersen. So not only does this survey indicate where the firm sees certain industries going, but it’s also a sign of where CPPIB might commit some investment capital.
The research, culled from international surveys with over 3,500 respondents as well as intensive conversations with the firm’s investment professionals and portfolio companies, indicates that there’s likely a new baseline in e-commerce usage that will continue to drive growth among companies that offer blended retail offerings and that offices are likely never going to return to full-time occupancy by every corporate employee.
Already CPPIB has made investments in companies like Fabric, a warehouse management and automation company.
The e-commerce wave has crested, but the tide may turn
Amid the good news for e-commerce companies is a word of warning for companies in the online grocery space. While usage surged to 31 percent of U.S. households, up from 13 percent in August, consumers gave the service poor marks and many grocers are actually losing money on online orders. The move online also favored bigger omni-channel vendors like Amazon and Walmart, the study found.
The CPPIB also found that there may be opportunities for brick and mortar vendors in the aftermath of the epidemic. As younger consumers return to shopping center they’re going to find fewer retailers available, since bankruptcies are coming in both the US and Europe. That could open the door for new brands to emerge. Meanwhile, in China, more consumers are moving offline with malls growing and customers returning to shopping centers.
Some of the biggest winners will actually be online entertainment and cashless payments — since fewer stores are accepting cash and music and video streaming represent low-risk, easier options than live events or movie theaters.
LOS ANGELES, CA – MAY 30: General views of tourists and shoppers returning to the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping mall for the first weekend of in-store retail business being open since COVID-19 closures began in mid-March on May 30, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.

Healthcare goes digital and privacy matters more than ever
Consumers in the West, already reluctant to hand over personal information, have become even more sensitive to government handling of their information despite the public health benefits of tracking and tracing, according to the CPPIB. In Germany and the U.S. half of consumers said they had concerns about sharing their data with government or corporations, compared with less than 20 percent of Chinese survey respondents.
However, even as people are more reluctant to share personal information with governments or corporations, they’re becoming more willing to share personal information over technology platforms. One-third of the patients who used tele-medical services in the U.S. during the pandemic did so for the first time. And roughly twenty percent of the nation had a telemedicine consultation over the course of the year, according to CPPIB data.
Technologies that improve the experience are likely to do well, because of the people who did try telemedicine, satisfaction levels in the service went down.

Cities and infrastructure will change
“From mass transit to public gatherings, few areas of urban life will be left unmarked by COVID-19,” write the CPPIB report authors.
Remote work will accelerate dramatically changing the complexion of downtown environments as the breadth of amenities on offer will spread to suburban communities where residents flock.  According to CPPIB’s data roughly half of workers in China, the UK and the US worked from home during the pandemic, up from 5 percent or less in 2019. In Canada, four-in-ten Canadian were telecommuting.
To that end, the CPPIB sees opportunities for companies enabling remote work (including security, collaboration and productivity technologies) and automating business practices. On the flip side, for those workers who remain wedded to the office by necessity or natural inclination, there’s going to need to be cleaning and sanitation services and someone’s going to have to provide some COVID-19 specific tools.
With personal space at a premium, public transit and ride hailing is expected to take a hit as well, according to the CPPIB report.

Supply chains become the ties that bind in a distributed, virtual world
As more aspects of daily life become socially distanced and digital, supply chains will assume an even more central position in the economy.
“Amid rising labor costs and heightened geopolitical risk, companies today are focused on resilience,” write the CPPIB authors.
Companies are reassessing their reliance on Chinese manufacturing since political pressure is coming from more regions on Chinese suppliers thanks to the internment of the Uighur population in Xinjiang and the crackdown on Hong Kong’s democratic and open society. According to CPPIB, India, Southeast Asia, and regional players like Mexico and Poland are best positioned to benefit from this supply chain diversification. Supply chain management software providers, and robotics and automation services stand to benefit.
“Confined to their homes for months and subjected to a rapid reordering of their perceived health risks and economic prospects, consumers are emerging from a shared trauma that will change their priorities and concerns for years to come,” the CPPIB study’s authors write."

You might too, if you were in the London-based startups place. With the stationary bike-makers value skyrocketing amid COVID-19 lockdowns, fitness startups are all the rage heck, just look at Lululemons recent Mirror acquisition.
A more apt comparison, however, is probably Ring Fit Adventure. The Switch-based peripheral is closer to Quell in terms of pricing, scale and experience. The startup is taking a similar game-based approach to the fitness experience.
At launch, it plans to offer a first-person boxing-style game that pits you against a series of monsters on the PC, Mac and iOS (with Android compatibility down the road). What sets Quells approach apart, however, is the wearable resistance system. Its basically an adjustable system of resistance bands that both simulate impact and track the wearers movements through a series of on-board sensors, including a gyroscope and accelerometers.
Image Credits: Quell
Its still pretty early stages here. In fact, today marks the launch of the products Kickstarter campaign, which will be seeking a bit over $30,000 in funding, with the system going for as low as ~$182 a pop. Thats down from around $200 for the final unit and, more importantly, includes lifetime access to all of the products software updates for free. Future buyers may well be subjected to a $10 a month fee for premium content.
Like a lot about the system, the subscription model is still being hammered out. There will be a narrative story mode and quick fight mode that youll have, the company tells TechCrunch. And the subscription fee will expand the possibilities to things like local and online multiplayer, along with new expansion content over time. And there will probably be cosmetic and other upgrades to your character.
Image Credits: Quell
Down the road, the system will likely expand to further gaming experiences in order to keep it fresh. Quell is also exploring the possibility of opening things up to third-party developers to create their own content for the system.
A lot of this is still hypothetical, as Quell is still an extremely small team, with four people currently working out of one of the founders’ London flat. In fact, the team only really came together in earnest in February and went full-time two months back. In spite of those humble and recent beginnings, however, the company already has the backing of Y Combinator and $10,000 in pre-orders since launching its website last month. Its amazing how much interest in home fitness something like COVID-19 can generate.
Quell expects to start shipping the product to backers in December. Perhaps by then people will have returned to the gym. But at this rate, who knows?"

In the tweet, posted on Monday, Trump claimed mail drop boxes are a “voter security disaster” and also said they are “not COVID sanitized.” Twitters notice says that the tweet violates its rules about civic and election integrity, but it “determined it may be in the publics interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.” Users can still retweet it with comment, but are nor prevented from liking, replying, or retweeting it alone.
Through its Twitter Safety account, the company gave more details, saying that the tweet had been flagged for “making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting.” It also cited a section from its Civic Integrity Policy, highlighting a line that forbids users from making “misleading claims about process procedures or techniques which could dissuade people from participating” in elections.

 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020
Mail-in ballots, which are expected to be used more widely by states in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have become a partisan issue leading up to the November presidential election. Despite what Trump said in his tweet, expert consensus is that mail-in ballots and absentee ballots are both secure. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states COVID-19 is spread mostly through close contact from person to person. Though it is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, the CDC says this is “not thought to be main way the virus spreads.”
After years of controversy over how the platform handled the presidents tweets that contained misleading, false, or incendiary statements, Twitter has recently begun taking a harder stance on Trumps account. In May, Twitter applied fact-check labels about mail-in ballots to two of Trumps tweets.
Days later, Trump signed an executive order targeting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives internet companies legal protections that shield them from liability for user-created content while also giving them power to make moderation decisions. The executive order argued that platforms forfeit their rights to legal protection when they moderate content, as Twitter did when it applied fact-check labels to Trumps tweets.
Though it is not clear if Trumps executive order is legally enforceable, it may serve to intimidate some platforms. Twitter called the order a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law, and its actions on Trumps tweets today may indicate that the company does not see it as a threat.

Doctors say one of the best ways to monitor patients with COVID-19 is by tracking their blood oxygen levels, which can show when they have dangerous breathing problems even if they dont feel short of breath. But along with toilet paper and digital thermometers, devices that measure those levels, called pulse oximeters, are hard to find. Theyre either sold out or taking weeks to ship from major retailers. 
With the devices out of reach, people are turning to questionable alternatives: the third most popular paid iPhone app last week claims to be able to measure blood oxygen levels through the phones camera, despite a disclaimer that says the app is not a medical device. On Reddit, some people fighting off COVID-19 say theyre using a health feature on some Samsung phone models to check their oxygen levels. Others say theyre using pulse oximetry features on smartwatches. 
That concerns doctors. Despite their accessibility, research shows pulse oximetry apps dont accurately measure blood oxygen levels, especially when theyre low. And relying on apps could be dangerous, says Walter Schrading, director of the office of wilderness medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.
The apps are easy party tricks when youre not sick: put your finger on the camera, get a normal oxygen reading. You can see, Im a normal human being, breathing normal air, he says. But when someone actually has low oxygen levels, theyre likely to still give that normal reading. They dont work well when you actually need them to work well, which is when your oxygen levels drop, Schrading says. 
Schrading and colleagues evaluated three iPhone pulse oximetry apps in a study published in 2019, and found that they couldnt reliably identify people who did not have enough oxygen. Their findings were consistent with other studies, which also found that pulse oximetry apps were inaccurate. A recent analysis from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, which reviewed the research on apps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, also concluded that they are unreliable.
Oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted, the authors of the analysis wrote. 
NEW rapid review by me (small clinical/ editing role) and Lionel Tarassenko, Professor of Electrical Engineering (major bioengineer role):
Q: Can smartphone apps be used to measure oxygen saturation?A: No.https://t.co/iIQqi66tUM
 Trisha Greenhalgh (@trishgreenhalgh) April 2, 2020
Apps dont work well because most use a different mechanism to test blood oxygen levels than standard, medical pulse oximetry devices. The devices send two different wavelengths of light usually red and infrared through a fingertip, where theres lots of blood close to the surface of the skin. Hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in blood, absorbs more infrared light when its carrying oxygen and more red light when its not. The device calculates the difference to determine how much oxygen is circulating. 
Smartphones usually only have white light, so theyre not able to get as accurate a reading. Samsung phones have a red light function, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said, but they only use one wavelength and would likely be unreliable as well.
In addition, standard pulse oximetry devices send light wavelengths through the finger and read the results from a sensor on the other side. Smartphones send and capture the light from the same spot they rely on the reflection of the wavelengths. That method tends to be less accurate and can be skewed by light from the environment. 
Some models of Fitbit and Garmin smartwatches also have pulse oximetry features. Fitbit can track oxygen level trends during sleep, and Garmin can give on-the-spot readings. Their watches do use red light, but they use the less-accurate reflective method. They also take readings from blood flow at the wrist which isnt as strong as it is at the finger. Both companies note on theirwebsites that their devices should not be used for medical purposes. 
Accurate blood oxygen readings are important when people are trying to monitor any disease, but its particularly key for COVID-19. Usually, someone with a low blood oxygen level knows it they struggle to catch their breath. If a person has a reading on a lower-quality oximeter that says they have low oxygen levels, but they dont have those symptoms, doctors can usually assume the sensor just isnt working, wrote James Hudspeth, the COVID response inpatient floor lead at Boston Medical Center, in an email to The Verge. 
People with COVID-19, though, sometimes feel fine even when their oxygen levels are plummeting. Thats why some doctors want pulse oximeters given to everyone home sick with the virus: if they can come into the hospital as soon as their oxygen levels dip but before theyre gasping for air, they might be treated more effectively. But it also means doctors would have less confidence interpreting a pulse oximeter result that doesnt match symptoms, Hudspeth said. 
If apps cant tell when oxygen levels are actually low, they could give a false sense of security to people who also feel okay. This thing could read normal, but you could not be normal, Schrading says. Its a big risk, he says. It would be dangerous to rely on them because they didnt measure what they were supposed to measure.

People are doing a lot more video conferencing now that theyre stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, conduct business with colleagues, and keep up with schoolwork. Sometimes, though, you may want to save a recording of the meeting so you can revisit it later. That could let you listen to a teachers lecture again, use the audio for a podcast, or even relive the announcement of a family pregnancy (which is something that actually happened to me on a recent family video call).
Many services offer ways to record video meetings, even on their free versions. Weve outlined here how to set up recordings for three well-known services: Zoom, Google Meet, and Skype. 
Zoom
Zoom lets you record calls whether youre a free user or a paid user. However, if youre a free user, youll only be able to save recordings to your computer. If you want to save recordings to the cloud, youll need to be on one of the companys paid offerings. Those plans start at $14.99 per user per month for its Pro plan and $1,800 per year for schools. 
Heres how to record a Zoom meeting:
<ul><li>If youre the host of your Zoom call, click the record button on the toolbar at the bottom of the call window to start the recording. If youre on a paid plan, you should see the option to pick between making a local recording or a cloud recording.</li><li>When the recording starts, youll be able to pause or stop the recording using buttons in the top left corner of your screen or on the Zoom toolbar.</li><li>If you opted for a local recording, the call will be converted into a .mp4 file and saved to your computer as soon as you end your meeting. In my testing, Zoom automatically opened the Finder window to the folder with both audio and video versions of the recording.</li><li>If you opted for a cloud recording, when you end your meeting, Zoom will show you a message saying that youll get an email when the recording is ready. For me, that email had a link to Zooms website with audio and video versions of the recording, as well as a password-protected link I could share with others so they could view and download the recording.</li></ul>Zooms website has support documents for cloud recordings, local recordings, and recording using Zooms iOS and Android apps if you want to learn more. The company also put together a helpful video that demonstrates how to record a call when youre using a computer.
Google Meet
For a limited time, anybody who is a G Suite customer should be able to record a call via Google Meet. Thats because Google has opened up free access to recording and other advanced Meet features until September 30th. After that date, video recording in Meet will presumably revert to only being available for customers of G Suite Enterprise, which costs $25 per user per month, and G Suite Enterprise for Education, which costs $48 per user per year (though Google is offering lower promotional pricing until July 31st under certain circumstances). If you plan to host video meetings via the free version of Google Meet thats rolling out over the coming weeks, though, you wont be able to make recordings, Google tells The Verge.
Heres how to record a Google Meet call. Note that I was not able to personally test these steps myself; the recording feature wasnt enabled for the G Suite account I use at work (or for the account of a colleague who has a personal G Suite account). If you dont see the recording option after following the steps below, it may not have rolled out to your account yet, or your companys G Suite settings may not let you make recordings. 
<ul><li>Once youre in the meeting, click the icon with the three vertical dots in the lower right hand of your screen. A menu will appear, and on the top of it, you should see a Record meeting option. Click that to start recording. The meeting organizer or anyone in the same organization as the host can record a meeting, according to Google.</li><li>To stop recording, click the three vertical dots again and click the Stop recording menu option at the top of the list.</li><li>Recordings will be saved to the meeting organizers Google Drive in a folder called Meet Recordings. The organizer will also receive an email with a link to the recording. If you arent the meeting organizer but activated a recording, youll also be emailed a link to the recording. A link to the recording will also be added to the calendar invite. </li></ul>Google has additional details about meeting recordings in this support document, and you can see a video about recording in Meet here.
Skype
Heres how to record a Skype call. 
<ul><li>Youll need to have at least one other person on your call to do a call recording. Once the other person has joined, you should see an option to Start Recording in the bottom left corner of your call window when you move your mouse. Either person can click on that to start a recording. </li><li>To stop recording, click the Stop recording button at the top of the screen or in the same bottom left corner of the window where the Start Recording button was.</li><li>When you end your call, youll be able to access the recording in the Skype app and download it to your computer. Recordings will be available for 30 days.</li></ul>You can also check out Microsofts support document about call recording in Skype if you want to learn more."

Google announced on Thursday that it will bring its SameSite cookie update back starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84. The update will roll out gradually to Chrome 80 and later versions.
When Chrome 80 launched in February, Google started rolling out its SameSite update, which is intended to change how cookies are handled by the browser. In April, Google announced it would be rolling back that update in order to keep essential websites working during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The update will resume starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84
Chrome used to accept cookies by default, but with the introduction of its SameSite labeling policy, Chrome will block cookies from functioning in a third-party context, unless they carry specific labels. This is part of Chromes phased approach to privacy: this is supposed to limit which cookies collect data across sites, and in turn, limit the data those websites collect on users. 
Blocking third-party cookies can cause some websites to break, particularly during the login process, since cookies store your login information across sites and visits. Prior to Google rolling back the update, several sites had been adjusted according to the SameSite policy. However, Google said it wanted to provide stability and continuity during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially for essential services, so it decided to temporarily halt the update with the aim to resume over the summer. 
Google is taking a gradual approach to blocking third-party cookies, since Google is worried that blocking cookies could break some websites. In contrast to Safari and Firefox, which block third-party cookies by default, Chrome has decided to phase them out within two years. Following this incremental plan, earlier this month Google announced Chrome would be blocking third-party cookies in incognito mode. The Chrome team is also working on a set of alternative technologies which are intended to preserve website revenue and allow advertisers to target audiences but without breaking logins to sites or being too invasive for consumers."

In North America and Europe, people usually spend about 90 percent of their time indoors. All that time inside affects our health and happiness, but how? 
Journalist Emily Anthes, author of the new book The Great Indoorstries to answer that question. Its a fascinating read especially at a time when the ongoing pandemic has changed how we spend our time inside. With restaurant dining off the table in many regions with coronavirus-induced lockdowns, people are spending more time cooking and baking at home. Others found themselves growing herb gardens in their kitchens to avoid long lines at grocery stores. The Verge spoke with Anthes about the costs and benefits that might come with some of our new indoor habits, and what we can do to foster a healthy environment at home. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
I really started thinking of our homes as ecosystems.
What got you interested in the ways that indoor spaces affect people?
The spark for the book really came from seeing a lot of studies on what scientists are starting to call the indoor microbiome. What struck me was how diverse and expansive their findings were. They were finding hundreds of thousands of species of bacteria and tens of thousands of species of fungi in homes across America. And so, I really started thinking of our homes as ecosystems.
Most of these creatures or critters or organisms that are in our homes are totally benign. In fact, a lot of them actually come from us. Theres also evidence to suggest that being exposed to a wide range and a rich assortment of microbes, especially early in life, when were kids seems to have a protective effect. It makes us less likely to develop asthma and autoimmune disease later in life. 
So how can I maintain a healthier home microbiome, while reconciling that with the fear of germs Ive developed because of COVID-19?
Thats very much a matter of debate. People are talking about things like home probiotics, and there are actually companies that already sell what they claim are probiotic sprays. And thats almost certainly premature. Partly because we still dont have a good sense of what a healthy home microbiome looks like. Its likely to be complex, not just one magic microbe you can spray around your home. 
When it comes to the coronavirus, I understand its a balance
But there are some good rules of thumb. Moisture is the enemy in general. You might have a lot of dormant fungal spores around your home and theyre typically harmless. But if they get wet, they can grow into mold, which can trigger allergies and other problems. So keep your home dry, keep it well ventilated, make sure not to use antimicrobial products. [Anthes writes in her book that, Bacteria adapt to these chemicals at lightning speed, and using them in our homes could help drive the emergence of new superbugs Moreover, coating the inside of our homes with antimicrobial compounds can wipe out the good microbes along with the bad.] 
When it comes to the coronavirus, I understand its a balance and we want to not have these pathogens in our homes. But it turns out that just soap and water does a really good job of getting rid of it. I would definitely recommend people stick to things like that rather than wipes that are advertised as being antibacterial. 
How might our built environments affect our health if were spending more time at home during the pandemic?
Indoor environments are now the main source of our exposure to air pollution.
One thing that Ive been looking into a little bit is indoor air quality. We know that increasing ventilation and making sure we have fresh air is a really important way to reduce transmission of the disease in indoor spaces. But its also important from the perspective of indoor air pollutants. Thanks to federal regulations, our outdoor air quality has gotten a lot better over recent decades. But indoor air quality remains largely unregulated. So for most of us, certainly here in the US, our indoor environments are now the main source of our exposure to air pollution. 
Spending more time at home does a couple of things. One, it potentially increases the time were spending surrounded by these pollutants. But theres also some data thats emerging to suggest that the air quality in our homes might actually be getting worse as we spend more time at home. Thats partly because two of the main causes of indoor air pollution are cooking and cleaning. Theres anecdotal evidence to say that were doing a lot more of that during the pandemic. 
So, how can we make our homes better for our well-being as we spend more time there during the pandemic? 
The list of benefits is almost endless.
A lot of people have been asking me this lately and my number one go-to recommendation is nature or plants. Theres overwhelming evidence that exposure to greenery and natural landscapes has all these benefits for us from reducing stress, anxiety, pain, boosting mood. The list of benefits is almost endless. And thats something Ive done in my own home. Ive brought a lot more house plants in. But the interesting thing about it is, if youre not really a gardener or youre worried about keeping plants alive, or maybe you dont have a lot of light, it doesnt have to be real plants. Theres evidence to suggest that even photos of nature or even nature sounds can have some of the same stress-relieving effects, and presumably fake plants as well. 
Theres a lot of evidence for the benefits of daylight, which also boosts mood. It keeps us alert during the day when were working. Exposure to lots of daylight during the day helps us sleep better at night. So, a real easy thing to do is make sure you open your curtains when you get up in the morning or raise your blinds. Those are two things that really have a lot of solid research behind them.
As an environmental reporter, Im often exploring how outdoor environments might affect health outcomes or create disparities. How might the way indoor spaces are designed lead to any disparities? 
Its something Ive been thinking about a lot in terms of the pandemic. We see places where the biggest super-spreading events or outbreaks are happening in places like prisons, meatpacking plants, dorms for migrant workers, nursing homes. These are all environments that tend to be home to vulnerable and marginalized people. And I dont think thats an accident that weve created these dense, poorly ventilated spaces that are not great for the spread of infectious disease for people that society tends to shunt aside. 
Obviously, the pandemic is devastating. And if I could snap my fingers and make it go away, I would. But its really made people more aware and conscious of their indoor environments. So I think there is an opening now to think through what kinds of spaces we want to create. Theres an opening and a chance to sort of do a better job of it. Thats something Ill be watching for in the months and years to come."

Chinese EV startup Byton is halting operations for at least six months due to financial problems that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has confirmed to The Verge, following reports from The Detroit Bureau and local media. This comes after employees in China have complained they are collectively owed millions of dollars while the company struggled to complete a $500 million funding round. 
Byton already furloughed hundreds of workers at its North American headquarters in Silicon Valley in April and all but admitted that its first vehicle an all-electric SUV with a massive dashboard screen called the M-Byte would be delayed again due to the impact of the pandemic. This is all despite Byton being backed by Chinas oldest state-owned automaker, First Auto Works (FAW), and having already completed a new factory in Nanjing, China, last year. 
The COVID-19 [pandemic] has posed great challenges to BYTONs funding and business.
Like everywhere, the COVID-19 [pandemic] has posed great challenges to BYTONs funding and business operations, Byton spokesperson Dave Buchko said in a statement to The Verge. As a result, he said, the companys management and its board of directors decided to implement the six-month suspension. Most of the companys employees in China will be furloughed, with only a small group of the team will be retained to stand by for possible business needs. 
Have information about Byton? Email the author at sean.okane@theverge.com, or use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.
Byton was founded in 2016 with backing from Chinese internet giant Tencent and Taiwanese manufacturing conglomerate Foxconn by former BMW executives Carsten Breitfeld (who led the i8 program) and Daniel Kirchert. Byton announced the concept version of the M-Byte at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, and shortly after, it revealed that FAW was investing in and partnering with the startup. 
The FAW deal was initially seen as a vote of confidence in what Breitfeld and Kirchert were building, especially since so many other EV startups at the time were struggling for funding and desperate to partner with big OEMs. But it eventually became a source of tension for Breitfeld, who left the startup in early 2019. Last September, as The Verge first reported, Breitfeld said that the Chinese government via FAW pushed the direction of Byton [to a place that was] not in line with what I thought we should do.
Breitfeld said at the time that Byton had used the Nanjing factory and other assets as collateral for the money that FAW invested and that he felt the state-owned automaker was going to drive it to a stage where the whole Byton thing will be shut down, they will just keep the plant and the [electric vehicle] platform. 
Byton sued co-founder Carsten Breitfeld late last year claiming he stole trade secrets
Breitfelds exit is, in fact, now part of a new legal dispute between the startup and its co-founder. In August 2019, Byton filed a previously unreported lawsuit against the Breitfeld accusing him of stealing and using the startups trade secrets at Iconiq, a separate Chinese EV startup that he worked following his split with Byton (and before he became CEO of Faraday Future). Byton claims Breitfeld announced his new position with Iconiq at the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2019, despite not resigning from Byton until the following month. 
The also startup alleges that Breitfeld wrongfully poached employees on his way out, that they were using and relying on Bytons confidential and trade-secret information to allow Iconiq to compete directly with Byton, and that many of the depictions and descriptions of lconiqs vehicles are remarkably similar to Bytons vehicles. 
Breitfeld has disputed much of this in court filings and contends that Bytons board of directors removed him as CEO in January 2019 before ultimately terminating him in April of that year. Breitfeld also alleges that Byton only filed the lawsuit to preempt any legal action he might take to receive the millions of dollars of compensation he believes he is contractually owed. That includes the remainder of his annual net salary from 2019, plus deferred compensation benefits, pension insurance, German pension, annual leave, home trip expenses, plus the value of tax advice, housing, cars, driver, school fees for his children, [and] guaranteed salary for his wife, which were all provided by Byton. Breitfeld also believes Byton should repurchase of all of his equity interest in the company."

Demand for Uber’s ride-hailing business has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic as people stay at home, but the same circumstances have driven a huge increase in food delivery orders. Uber has been looking for ways to boost its food service, Uber Eats, after laying off more than a quarter of the company’s overall workforce.
Uber attempted to buy GrubHub earlier this year, but the deal fell apart amid reported antitrust scrutiny and GrubHub ended up going to European service Just Eat Takeaway for $7.3 billion. Postmates would likely be a smaller deal; it’s a private company and its last valuation was $2.4 billion. The company has already been in talks to sell itself to suitors including DoorDash and GrubHub, according to the Times.

NASA has once again delayed the launch of its new powerful space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, mostly due to disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recently slated to fly in March of 2021, the massive telescope is now scheduled to launch on October 31st, 2021.
The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, had already predicted this delay. NASA came up with the new date after doing an extensive review to see if the March 2021 timing was actually possible. The agency attributes about three months of the delay to social distancing and other precautions that had to be put in place to keep people safe from the coronavirus. Much of the impact, of course, comes from people not being at work, right? Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, said during a press conference. Not touching the hardware or from having a reduced number of people available to do shifts. 
coronavirus isnt solely to blame
However, coronavirus isnt solely to blame. Two additional months were added to the schedule thanks to technical challenges experienced by the primary contractor, Northrop Grumman, as it pieced the telescope together and conducted testing. Northrop Grumman has already dealt with numerous technical problems during the development of the spacecraft, such as washers and screws coming loose during tests as well as accidental tears in the vehicles thin sunshield, which is designed to protect the observatory from the intense heat of the Sun. NASA then added an extra two months as schedule margin, in case other unknown problems crop up between now and launch.
The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, has been plagued with delays throughout its entire history. The observatory, first conceived in the 1990s, was projected to cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion, with a launch date somewhere between 2007 and 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. Ever since then, the cost of the project has ballooned and the launch date has been repeatedly delayed. 
In 2011, Congress replanned the entire project, creating a cap of $8 billion on the telescopes development, with a launch in 2018. But in 2018, NASA delayed the project yet again, stating that $8.8 billion was needed for the development, and that the entirety of the mission would cost $9.66 billion, including the cost of operating the telescope in space. That year, NASA set the March 2021 launch date.
NASA does not expect to exceed that budget any further, even with the new delay. Based on current projections, the program expects to complete the remaining work within the new schedule, without requiring additional funds, Gregory Robinson, the program director for James Webb, said during a press call, where we use existing program funding to stay within this $8.8 billion development cost cap.
Were not expecting to go beyond October 31st.
NASA says it has already spoken with Arianespace, the company that will launch JWST, about the delay. The company claims that the rockets intended ride, the Ariane 5, will be ready to take the vehicle to space next Halloween. NASA is also standing firm by the October 31st date. Were not expecting to go beyond October 31st, Robinson said. We have high confidence in that.
The James Webb Space Telescope is destined to be the most powerful space observatory ever built when its launched, capable of peering back in time to when the Universe first came into being 13.8 billion years ago. The telescope sports a massive gold-plated mirror, measuring 21 feet, or 6.5 meters, across, that will gather light from the distant reaches of the cosmos."

As the pandemic continues to keep people inside, some jobs have shifted from office culture to working from home. For developers adjusting to this new reality, many say theyre struggling to stay focused and productive under the new conditions, according to a new survey published by GDC. The results, released today, include almost 2,500 developers. 
Of those who responded to the survey, 70 percent say theyve switched to working from home. Workers cited specific problems around child care, communication, distractions, as well as general anxiety over larger troubles. The biggest overall team challenge has been managing ambient stress, wrote one respondent. Everyone has been affected by the pandemic in some way, even if not directly, and the general atmosphere of anxiety is impossible to ignore completely. 
Shortly after the beginning of quarantine for many US-based employees, developers who spoke with The Vergecited similar problems. While some, like developers at Bungie, quickly pivoted to setting up infrastructure for their employees to adjust to home, others struggled to generally focus. 
Although GDCs survey shows that developer jobs have been largely unaffected by COVID thus far 8 percent reported job loss due to the pandemic its harder to account for the impact on mental health. While 32 percent reported that they felt productivity had decreased at home, developers also report their creativity has somewhat decreased (28 percent) or greatly decreased (7 percent). However, that doesnt necessarily point to troubles with home itself. As one respondent put it, The overall situation (financial troubles at company level, additional meetings and overhead, anxiety going to the grocery store) is probably more to blame than staying at my home is.
anxiety going to the grocery store is probably more to blame than staying at my home is
Business appears to be have been meaningfully affected, surveyors say, with some seeing upticks in earnings even as others suffer significant business downturns. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported overall business is about the same, while another 24 percent said somewhat increased. On either end of the spectrum, 7 percent said their business has greatly increased, while another 8 percent say its greatly decreased. Roughly 33 percent of developers, or 1 in 3, say theyve had a game delayed. 
The game industry, notorious for crunch, may still need to grapple with how employees find work-life balance under these new conditions. Many developers (39 percent in total) say that theyre working longer hours than pre-pandemic. Its harder to establish limits when working from home, one wrote. You feel youre at home so its okay to do 2, 3, 4+ extra hours. The company also encourages (unpaid) crunch.
As for what the future holds, more than half of developers (64 percent) say that their companies have adopted new practices and processes that will continue once lockdown ends. For some, that means more freedom to work from home. We had to make some changes on our daily tasks to compensate not being at our office working physically together, but those have proven to increase our efficiency and productivity, wrote one developer. Lately we have even talked about embracing the home office configuration even after the pandemic."

 (The Conversation)Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses have been given unprecedented media attention for their daily, selfless sacrifices. Make no mistake: Covid-19 patients recover largely because of the nursing services they receive. Yet, hidden within the layers of care rendered by nurses are the psychological traumas they endure.
Now, as nurses are hailed as health care heroes during the pandemic, we're faced with what to do about these psychological injuries, not only for the 4 million nurses in the US the largest health care workforce in America but for the rest of us who depend on them.
For the past five years, I've examined the types of psychological trauma that nurses experience. Along with Dr. John Thompson, my co-author, I've described them in our 2019 book, prophetic as it was published six months before Covid-19 first appeared in China.
Prior to the pandemic, nurses faced ethical and personal safety dilemmas during disasters and other emergencies. They saw patients suffer, not only from illness itself, but because of health care interventions, otherwise known as medically induced trauma (think of a patient on a ventilator).
In a follow-up study after the book was published, I dug deeper, collected information from nurses, and learned of yet another type of psychological injury: insufficient resource trauma. This occurs when nurses don't have the staff, supplies, knowledge or access to other professionals to fulfill ethical or professional responsibilities. The pandemic has been a dark catalyst to seeing this urgent concern. In a survey of 32,000 nurses just completed by the American Nurses Association, 68% of nurses said they are worried about being short-staffed and 87% are very or somewhat afraid to go to work.
Demands for resources largely ignored for decades
A particularly big part of insufficient resource trauma comes from inadequate nurse staffing levels, which may lead to bad outcomes for both nurses and patients. The evidence for these outcomes, both compelling and consistent worldwide, is based on more than two decades of research. Having to forego what you know is right when there's just not enough staffing in a high-stakes environment feels like a betrayal of one's spirit. A nurse's sense of morality, of what is right and wrong, is endangered.
More recently, there has been a shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) throughout US hospitals. But I know nurses who were told by employers to take care of Covid-19 patients regardless of whether or not adequate PPE was available. Clearly this was a danger to both nurses and patients; surely this qualifies as a traumatizing experience.
Other nurses some new, some working previously in non-acute care have been deployed to critical care units. Understanding the technology of these complex environments requires a steep learning curve. The knowledge, then, to competently care for these patients may be considered an insufficient resource.
The toll on patients and nurses
Nurses, more than anything, strive to deliver high-quality care and connect with patients during their most vulnerable times. But often there isn't the time. The inability to achieve that goal causes stress. Imagine being forced to choose between giving morning meds and sitting down with a patient newly diagnosed with cancer or spending time with the family of a patient with Covid-19. Choices like that leave nurses focused on tasks and morally injured.
In my pre-pandemic study, traumatized nurses report symptoms of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder): intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, ""brain fog"" and flashbacks. They felt unsafe, isolated and dissatisfied with the profession. As nurses, they felt like failures. One former bedside nurse quit, opting instead for office work, where her ""level of trauma and stress is virtually nonexistent.""
Some traumas may be unavoidable. That happens when the nurse fully engages with the patient and co-experiences suffering. This is called secondary or vicarious trauma. That's why we need to offer trauma-informed care to both nurse and patient. Meaningful connections with others is critical, but so is psychological safety.
The pandemic has focused our attention on the mental health needs of health care providers. Nursing organizations have responded, and these efforts are to be applauded. But until we appreciate the sovereignty of nurses, who practice in a way no other health provider does, solutions to avoid trauma will be stalled. And nurses will continue to struggle.
While I haven't been at the bedside for a number of years, I still remember how it felt to report to the acute care center at the hospital, hoping no one had called in sick. When that happened, I was assigned an extra patient or two. I knew I couldn't give the care I wanted to the paraplegic young man. I knew I couldn't spend more time communicating with the older adult who had a sudden right-sided stroke. I couldn't give them the things so important to healing -- the physical care, the nursing presence and the compassion they needed and deserved.
Those experiences stay with you. It's a heck of a feeling.
Nursing care is both an art and a science; it is a distinct profession that wields enormous influence on those who need the most help. They do not merely follow instructions from other providers. It's a beautiful profession, unlike any other, founded on intellect, judgment and a caring spirit. It pushes a person to examine values such as social justice and the ethics of life, and it becomes a part of who a nurse is.
Until all of us see nursing this way and until organizations provide sufficient resources to prevent avoidable trauma, which will allow nurses to provide safe, quality care nurses will continue to suffer. More will choose to leave the profession. Particularly now, that's a loss society can't afford.

 (The Conversation)With prospects of a Covid-19 vaccine looking up, attention is also turning to the problem of anti-vax ideas. According to a recent survey, one in six Britons would refuse a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Although vaccine hesitancy is a complex problem with multiple causes, the number of conspiracy theories circulating about the coronavirus do not help.
The fight against Covid-19-related conspiracy theories will be fought on multiple fronts. It requires a broad public health campaign and for social media companies to control the spread of disinformation. But all of us can play a part in this effort. Most people will know someone who has succumbed to conspiracy theories about the current crisis.
I have been researching conspiracy theories for over two decades and have spoken to many believers. Here are the six rules I use for talking to conspiracy theorists in the effort to change their mind.
1. Acknowledge scale of the task
Talking to people who endorse conspiracy theories is inherently difficult. Simply laying out evidence or pointing out logical contradictions in the conspiracist argument is seldom enough. Conspiracy theories are, by definition, irrefutable.
Lack of evidence of a conspiracy, or positive proof against its existence, is taken by believers as evidence of the craftiness of those behind the plot, and their ability to dupe the public. So arm yourself with patience, and be prepared to fail. 
2. Recognize the emotional dimension
Conspiracy theories seduce not so much through the power of argument, but through the intensity of the passions that they stir. Underpinning conspiracy theories are feelings of resentment, indignation and disenchantment about the world. They are stories about good and evil, as much as about what is true.
This gives conspiracy theories a strong emotional dimension. Tempers can flare and conversations turn into a shouting match. It is important to prevent this from happening. Be prepared to de-escalate the situation and keep the dialogue going, without necessarily giving ground.
3. Find out what they actually believe
Before trying to persuade someone, find out the nature and content of his beliefs. When it comes to conspiracy theories, the world is not divided into ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" -- there's a lot in between.
A minority of committed believers treat conspiracy theories as the literal truth and are particularly resistant to persuasion. Many others might not see themselves as ""believers,"" but are willing to accept that conspiracy theorists might be onto something and are at least asking the right questions. Establishing the precise nature, and extent, of someone's belief, will enable you to better tailor your response.
Also, try and find out what specific conspiracy theory they endorse. Is it 5G or Bill Gates that they think is behind coronavirus? Or both? What videos or websites have they looked at? Once you find out, gather as much disconfirming evidence as you can from credible sources, including multiple independent fact-checking websites.
Background research will help you to focus the discussion on the substance of the claims. Never question someone's intelligence or moral sense, as this is the quickest way to end a conversation.
4. Establish common ground
One of the main problems with conspiracy theories is that they are not confined to tinfoil-hat-wearing kooks or political extremists. In times of crisis and uncertainty, they can contaminate the worldview of otherwise reasonable people.
Conspiracy theories make reality seem less chaotic, and tap into broader, often well-grounded concerns about the world such as the concentration of financial and political power, mass surveillance, inequality or lack of political transparency. So when talking about conspiracy theories, start by acknowledging these broader concerns and restrict your discussion to whether conspiracy theories can provide an adequate or meaningful answer.
Many people come to conspiracy theories through genuine, albeit misguided, curiosity about how to make sense of the world. They sometimes see themselves as healthy skeptics and self-taught researchers into complex issues. Avoid criticising or mocking this. Instead, present it as something that, in principle, you value and share. Your aim, after all, is not to make them less curious or skeptical, but to change what they are curious about, or skeptical of.
Conspiracy theories often sound convincing because they start with the detailed exposition of credible scientific or historical facts. The problem is that these facts and arguments lead to extraordinary conclusions.
The kernels of truth on which conspiracy theories are based are a solid starting point for a discussion. Agreement on at least some of the facts will allow you to focus on the leap of imagination that allows two and two to make five.
5. Challenge the facts, value their argument
Debunking conspiracy theories requires a two-pronged approach. The first involves challenging evidence and its origins. Address specific claims and discuss what constitutes a credible source. Offer to look at the evidence together, including on fact-checking websites.
If you are talking to a staunch believer, he probably won't even engage with you on this. But if he has not yet fallen down the rabbit hole, he might, and this may lead him to start questioning his views.
The second approach involves challenging the relevance and value of the conspiracist case more generally. You may want to point out that throughout history, conspiracy theories have come up short.
For instance, the longstanding claims by AIDS denialists that antiretroviral drugs are more harmful than HIV were not only disproven, but they contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. More recent and similarly baseless theories about the polio vaccine causing sterility directly led to the disease resurging in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afganistan.
Covid-19-related claims are in the same genre. Setting these conspiracy theories in their historical context can demonstrate that they offer nothing new, and don't ask the right questions about the pandemic and its causes. This just might encourage the person to direct their curiosity and skepticism to more worthwhile concerns.
There is, of course, no guarantee that this advice will be effective. There are no incontestable arguments or fail-proof strategies that will always convert a conspiracy theorist to skepticism. Therefore, set realistic expectations. The aim of talking to conspiracy theorists is not to convert them, but to sow doubt about an argument, and hopefully enable them to gradually build up resistance to its seductive appeal.

 (CNN)On Thursday, we hit a grim watershed. The US overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. This is a dire crisis and an extraordinary failure of President Donald Trump. Americans are suffering and dying because the Trump administration failed to act quickly and decisively to prevent the virus' spread. The US has now seen about 1,195 deaths and the number is rising rapidly. 
On Thursday, the US saw an increase of more than 15,000 cases in one day -- a shocking surge that can be explained by both the spread of the virus and increased testing after weeks of shortages -- pushing the total number of confirmed cases over 82,000. China, in comparison, has reported 81,285 cases. 
There is a fundamental difference between China and the US. China has broken the spread of the virus with a lockdown that first started in Wuhan on January 23 and is now being lifted in stages; only a few dozen new cases are allegedly confirmed each day, and most of these are apparently introduced from abroad. The US has not broken the epidemic. And if Trump has his way, easing guidelines to stay at home by Easter, we will fail to stop the epidemic and millions more will be infected. Even with active control, we might be facing around 81,000 deaths by July according to a new detailed analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The transfer of the virus, which may have originated in bats, to humans was an unforeseen event. The response to that event has been determined by the policies of nations. On December 31, the Wuhan government publicly confirmed it was treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new pneumonia outbreak and on January 7, officials identified a new coronavirus as the cause. The first confirmed case in Japan was identified in mid-January, with South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and the US following suit within days.
The East Asian countries went into action. Many had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak and had public health teams on alert for new epidemics. More than two months later, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed in the US, with more than 250 cases per million people, far higher than China, which has approximately 57 cases per million; Hong Kong, 60; Taiwan, 11; Singapore, 117; Japan, 11; and Korea, 180. 
Trump bears direct responsibility for America's unpreparedness and failed response to the epidemic. Since Trump came into office, he has systematically taken apart our protective public health system. The pandemic unit at the National Security Council was dismantled in 2018 under his watch. Trump slashed the CDC's epidemic control teams in 39 countries, including China. And when the epidemic hit, Trump ignored it, downplayed it, and made repeated false claims. Even now, he spouts vulgar nonsense about restarting the economy by Easter when public health experts say the threat is going to persist for far longer.
Trump is profoundly culpable, but he is not the only reason for America's dismal situation in the face of this epidemic. Our for-profit health care system rakes in money on disease, not on health. Instead, we have a system that works for the rich, instead of a public health system for all Americans that readily anticipates and controls new pathogens through testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. 
Americans across the country are fighting to stay alive, while Trump acts as if he is more intent on saving the economy. We can still try to control the virus as the East Asian countries are doing. We need decisive action across states and cities. We are finding leadership today in our governors, mayors and our brave frontline health workers."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)I talk about and explain things for a living. I have also been covering the coronavirus outbreak for weeks.
But when it comes to talking about all this with my own children, I've been finding myself tongue-tied.
At first, I didn't talk about it with my daughters. I have a 5 and a 2-year old, so I just made sure to remind them they needed to wash their hands more often.
But when my eldest daughter walked out of school and declared, ""Mom, there's something called 'Corona' and everyone is getting sick,"" I knew I couldn't avoid it any longer.
I then tried telling my 5-year-old ""there is a sickness"" but she didn't need to worry too much about it. That led to her asking in full voice, walking down the sidewalk, ""Does that person have the sickness?"" Then pointing at the next person and asking again, ""How about that person? Does he have the sickness?""
It quickly set in that I needed some help, expert help on how to have this conversation. I also quickly realized I'm not alone. My producer told me her 6-year-old wanted to know if he could still give her a kiss goodnight as he was concerned that he would give her the coronavirus.
As parents, we could all use a little help in this unprecedented moment. I started with the person I always go to first when it comes to the health and well-being of my children -- our pediatrician. ""The fewer words, the better always,"" Dr. Bruce Brovender of Global Pediatrics advised. ""But always be honest."" 
If you're not, he said, ""You actually make things scarier and more traumatic because they don't know what the truth is and what [it] is not.""
Brovender's guidance motivated me to dig deeper. And after spending hours on the phone with doctors, experts and clinicians, I've found some helpful common threads of the dos and don'ts when talking to our little ones about something so big.
 Be reassuring but be honest
""The most important thing across ages is that children need to know that they're going to be OK and chances are their parents are going to be OK,"" says Tovah Klein, director of the Barnard Center for Toddler Development at Columbia University. ""The first thing is to reassure them about that.""
""It's a balance between addressing children's worry and fears, because that is real, and reassuring them because the truth is most people do get better from this.""
Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, adds that comes with the balance that this can't be treated like any other day. ""It's really critical that people understand that it's not like a snow day. We need to not have play dates. We need to not have the birthday parties; we need to postpone those until we have a clearer picture of what's going on with this.""
And in explaining these abrupt changes to children, it's important to remind them ""the grown-ups are handling it,"" says clinical psychologist Rebecca Schrag Hershberg. ""We don't have to pretend we know all the answers, but we do have to project a calm confidence that there are smart people everywhere -- doctors, policymakers, teachers -- all working together to make sure we get through this.""
""Children are hearing a tremendous amount. They're hearing big words that they've never heard before, none of us have really,"" says Klein. ""Even the terms coronavirus and Covid-19, it's like what's that?
""I've been telling parents that it's really important that the parent is the filter of the information,"" Klein adds. For older children that may be addressing misinformation they hear from friends or on social media. For younger children that may just start with demystifying terms, like answering ""what is coronavirus?"" The answer Klein suggests: ""It's a really big word but it's a fancy word for what we normally call a cold or the flu and something that's been around for a long time. Now there's a new virus and that's what everyone is talking about.""
Hershberg agrees that transparency is key. ""I think transparency for kids, even little kids, is more comforting than the alternative when they notice that there's a huge elephant in the room, but they also notice no one is talking about it."" 
""Listen first and talk second. Listen for concerns, questions and misinformation while you are enjoying usual play with your children -- whether that is drawing, dolls, or throwing a ball. Then let kids know you're glad they are asking you questions and sharing what is on their mind,"" says Dr. Joshua Morganstein, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Psychiatric Dimensions on Disasters. ""Young children need fewer words, and they'll be reassured and comforted by a calm parent.""
Hershberg adds that it's a good practice to avoid the tendency to want to fill the silence when it comes to these types of sensitive conversations with your kids. ""If they ask a question, you answer their questions in a direct, clear and brief way and then pause and see if they have any more questions. Pause and see what happens next."" 
How to say, 'I don't know'
It's OK to say ""I don't know,"" experts agree. ""In fact, it's important to do so,"" says Morganstein. ""When children find out you misled them, it will undermine their trust in you.""
But it appears there are more helpful ways to say, ""I don't know"" than just saying ""I don't know."" There is, ""I don't know. Why don't we look that up together,"" says Morganstein. This allows you to model for the child that when you don't know something, you seek out information about it. ""This can really enhance a sense of trust that a child has in you, knowing that you can count on your parents to tell you what they know, tell you want they don't know and then go find out the answer.""
""You can say, I need to think about that,"" says Hershberg, helping play out another ""I don't know"" scenario. ""Saying I don't know in a calm and puzzled voice, not in panicked and worried voice, is not uncomfortable for our kids unless we make it uncomfortable."" 
""Kids can feel really comforted when you say 'you know there are so many people asking that exact question at this exact moment. We are in a community of a whole world of people, all asking that question.'""
This is all about how to talk to our children about Covid-19. And so, I was perhaps most surprised about how many of these experts emphasized the impact of our own stress and anxiety levels on how our children are handling and processing this uncertain time.
""It's overwhelming for parents right now because this is such a fluid situation. Every day, even every half day it's a new thing going on with Covid-19,"" Goza told me. ""So, it's overwhelming for parents and it's really frightening for kids.""
But it starts with us not making matters worse for our kids. ""First, check your own stress level. If you (or other adults around them) are behaving in a highly stressed manner, your children may simply be picking up on and emulating this behavior,"" says Morganstein. 
""Don't talk to your kids about any of this stuff when you're in a moment of anxiety,"" adds Hershberg. ""If you hear something or read a tweet that makes you really anxious, it's OK to say to your child, 'before I'm going to answer that question, I'm actually feeling a little bit worried right now so I'm going to take my three deep breaths, do you want to do that with me?'""
And an important reminder, that kids of different ages will express their anxiety in these anxiety-inducing times in very different ways.
""Overall, it's important to remember that distress looks different in kids and in children at different ages. Isolation, diminished academic performance or aggression may be seen in older children. Irritability, lethargy or return to earlier age behaviors can be seen in young children. For parents who are understandably distracted and already feeling heightened stress themselves, this can be easily misinterpreted as 'misbehavior',"" says Morganstein.
When we are all feeling pretty helpless, let's be honest, it can help children through these moments by giving them some of the power back. That can be helpful when explaining why they have to wash their hands so much, why they can't play with their friends like they normally do and it can be especially helpful with questions about grandparents and the elderly.
""Empower children by saying, look we don't get very sick [from the coronavirus] but believe it or not we could still have that virus, we have to help so that not too many people get sick. That's part of our job,"" suggested Klein.
""That also explains the hand washing -- 'that keeps the germs away and the virus away.'
""That explains school closing -- 'we're trying to really keep this virus from spreading so you're not going to be with so many other people. That's why mommy or daddy has to work from home now.' All of those pieces can be put in the context of we're all working together.""
Hershberg reminds us that children often process difficult events through play, so empower them to do that. ""Cast a magic spell on the virus... Pretending to be Elsa and freezing the virus. Those are all things that will help kids feel powerful and also let them process the feelings.""
So, let them play out the feelings, whatever they are. ""It's healthy and means they feel safe talking about it,"" says Hershberg.
Giving that sense of empowerment to older children understandably requires a different approach. ""There's going to be a lot of sadness about missing sports events, proms and a lot of things, and I just think we have to give them that reassurance,"" says Goza. ""The more we do now to make this pandemic be as short as we can...then the sooner they'll be able to get out and do those things.""
""You can be the germ destroyers or germ busters,"" says Klein. ""Making it light and fun. Not making it so serious that is scares the children.""
Hershberg agrees saying, ""Your family [are] superheroes fighting the virus and every time you wash hands, you are taking a step to keep people healthy and safe,"" she suggests. ""You are emphasizing that this is an active choice and that we are all joining together to do it. And not that we're all just helpless in our houses waiting to hear what's going on.""
While no one can say for sure when this crisis will end, this expert advice gives me a great place to start when it's time for more tough conversations in the days ahead -- when the girls and I aren't playing Super Germ Busters."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)A college friend who is now a physician first introduced me to an electronic cigarette in 2008. He purchased his online from China with the hope of transitioning from smoking to vaping but found himself using both instead. A few years later, he shared a pleasant surprise -- he had succeeded in quitting both vaping and smoking. 
The breakthrough came one winter while he was recovering from a cold. As he reached for the e-cigarette, he realized the hazard of exposing his recovering lungs to a cloud of smoke. He gave his e-cigarette away, and never vaped or smoked again. His success story highlights the power of a second event to break the nicotine addiction. The current Covid-19 pandemic may serve as a similar warning call to smokers and vapers to stop promptly.
Over the past 10 months, three serial waves of severe acute respiratory illnesses have strained the American emergency care delivery system from 1) e-cigarette, or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI), 2) the influenza season, and 3) Covid-19. Around June 2019, US hospitals first noted a rise in respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked this EVALI outbreak into early 2020, ultimately counting 2,807 hospitalized patients in all 50 US states, with 68 deaths as of February. Overlapping with the EVALI crisis has been the influenza season, which runs from October through May. So far, the CDC estimated there have been at least 39 million US cases of the flu, leading to 400,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 deaths. The third stress has been the worldwide pandemic of Covid-19, totaling, at the time of writing, 337,933 cases in the US and 9,653 deaths. 
Smoking has many negative effects on respiratory health, and the possibility of a relationship between smoking (both traditional cigarettes and marijuana) or vaping with Covid-19 were raised by early observations in China. One report, looking at 1,099 laboratory confirmed cases in China, revealed that 12.4% of smokers either died, required ICU admission or needed intubation, compared to 4.7% among never smokers. Another study found that among Chinese patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, the odds of disease progression (including death) were an order of magnitude higher among smokers compared to non-smokers. The World Health Organization has noted that cigarette smokers are likely to have more serious illness if infected with Covid-19.
The FDA has advised that cigarette smoking and vaping may leave users with underlying health conditions and increase the risk of coronavirus pneumonia and increase its severity. Further research should be undertaken to determine the extent. The US Surgeon General has reported that smoking is strongly linked to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and coronary artery disease, all of which impair the immune response and the ability to fight Covid-19. 
Active research is ongoing to assess the long-term health risks of marijuana use and vaping, including pediatric chronic bronchitis. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio highlighted a possible connection between the coronavirus and vaping after noting a healthy 22-year-old New York City man, whose only risk factor appeared to be a history of vaping, was hospitalized for Covid-19. The CDC has reported that up to 20% of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in the US are between ages 20 and 44, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom noted that half of the Covid-19 cases in California are in younger adults aged 18 to 49. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speculated that the popularity of vaping might explain the increased incidence of Covid-19 among youth and young adults, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse has included vapers on the list of groups who could be most impacted by Covid-19.
A related question is whether previous vaping-related lung injuries may predispose to a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. EVALI patients who survived may develop long term respiratory issues. If they were to contract Covid-19, they might also be at greater risk for respiratory failure, prolonged intubation and mortality. 
As they recover from the coronavirus, smokers and vapers should make every effort to stop to protect their lung health. Repeatedly inhaling from an e-cigarette (possibly coated with viruses or bacteria) violates the principle of minimizing contact with one's mouth and face to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19. Sharing an e-cigarette with others only increases that risk further. While the cigarette butt is discarded after each use, e-cigarette devices are used repeatedly. Perhaps e-cigarettes should be designed to be disposable, to minimize the risk of infection transmission. Another area to study further is whether the plume of vaping aerosol generated might deposit virus particles on surfaces in the environment. 
The majority of cases from the EVALI outbreak were associated with vaping of marijuana/THC contaminated with vitamin E acetate. But the CDC did not exclude that other causes might exist, as 14% of the EVALI patients ""exclusively used nicotine-containing products.""
Perhaps some of the mysterious EVALI cases from the winter of 2019 should now be re-analyzed, to determine if the coronavirus may have played a role. Bronchoscopy biopsies and lung specimens stored in pathology labs across America could be assessed to see if coronavirus RNA is present. Similarly, reanalyzing influenza cases from the winter may reveal if the current cases of infection we are witnessing are actually a second wave.
The initial impact of Covid-19 on the e-cigarette industry was an interruption of the supply chain. About 90% of the world's e-cigarette hardware is produced in China, and many factories in Shenzhen were closed during the coronavirus outbreak there. More recently, many vape shops across America have closed, having been defined as non-essential services. This likely made it more difficult for youth to acquire vaping devices from peers or older siblings, or at school. Another unintended benefit of mandatory school closures has been the opportunity for parents to monitor, and have conversations with their children while they are at home to curb youth vaping.
Given the adverse effect on respiratory health, the current coronavirus pandemic should serve as a message to both smokers and vapers to quit promptly and take immediate action to reduce their risks of viral transmission. 
And if doing so immediately seems like too big of a task, at the very least, other measures like regularly sanitizing e-cigarettes and cannabis smoking devices should be taken.
Smokers and vapers should also be more mindful of the secondhand smoke and clouds generated, avoid generating large clouds in public from vape tricks, and follow clean indoor air laws. Social distancing could be extended to the vapor generated to maintain a 6-foot distance from others when in public spaces, or to smoke and vape only in confined spaces. Active research is ongoing but difficult to conduct while simultaneously treating a pandemic, and many questions about the risks to smokers and vapers and those around them will be answered over time. 
Ultimately, Covid-19 presents a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate our nation towards the dual goals of smoking and vaping cessation."

Later that day, editorial board members of The Observer -- the student newspaper covering Notre Dame, as well as neighboring Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross College -- held an emergency Zoom meeting. They discussed the school's announcement and the option of temporary remote learning versus going virtual for the entire semester.
An editor spoke up: ""I've been thinking about this for a while,"" the editor said. ""About what we're going to do when they make us write obituaries.""
That's how the idea was born. On Friday, The Observer's front page highlighted this plea: ""Don't make us write obituaries.""
""We wanted to make the messaging clear that we all have a role to play in keeping the tri-campus community safe,"" editor-in-chief Maria Leontaras, a senior at St. Mary's, told CNN. ""There are more people here than just young students who could possibly recover from the virus.""
In the editorial, the board asked everyone -- students, the administration and faculty -- to do everything in their power to contain the virus. 
""The University administration has largely blamed the COVID-19 outbreak on students attending off-campus parties,"" the editorial said. ""While this isn't entirely misplaced, it has been used to deflect responsibility from the very administrations that insisted they were prepared for us to return to campus.""
If more isn't done, the editorial said, the worst may be still to come.
""The blame for this does not lie with just one party. We -- as students, faculty, staff and administrators -- need to share responsibility for the outbreak on our hands,"" the editorial said.
Notre Dame announced Tuesday that if its efforts to contain the coronavirus don't work, the school will shift to remote learning for the rest of the semester. 
The school has seen more than 300 confirmed cases of the virus since the beginning of the month. In Tuesday's video announcement to students, university president Rev. John I. Jenkins called the spike ""very serious.""
""For your sake, the sake of our community, and for continuing our semester on campus, please observe health protocols,"" he said. ""Avoid behavior that puts yourself or others at risk.""
But Leontaras said she and other editors would like to see more transparency from the university, like how many students are in quarantine, for example. 
Colleges and universities across the United States are dealing with similar problems as they reopen, with some seeing hundreds of coronavirus cases in just a week or two of classes. 
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill canceled in-person classes after just one week, after cases ballooned. University employees have filed a class action lawsuit against the UNC System, alleging unsafe workplace conditions because of Covid-19.

Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said during a telebriefing with journalists that the trials will take place in several countries around the globe. 
""We're going to do clinical trials not just in Russia but also the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, probably in Brazil or in India,"" Dmitriev said. He also said that a delegation from the Saudi Ministry of Health would be traveling to Moscow next week. 
Experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine, named Sputnik V, was registered and how few details about the research have been released. 
Dmitriev said on Thursday that Russia would try to answer Western criticism over the lack of information about its vaccine candidate by publishing a detailed science paper in a ""major publication"" in August. He declined to name the publication where the study would publish.
He also refused to give an exact number for how many people have tested the vaccine already.
So far, Russia hasn't released any scientific data on its testing and CNN is unable to verify the vaccine's claims of safety or effectiveness. 
The forthcoming clinical trials are to assess the ""epidemic efficacy"" of the vaccine, Denis Logunov, deputy director for scientific work at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, who is developing the Russian Covid-19 vaccine candidate, said on Thursday. 
Alexander Ginsburg, director of Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, described on Thursday how the vaccine is given in two doses and involves using uses a different adenovirus for each of the two doses. 
Dmitriev said that ""Russia is open to international cooperation"" and ""we do believe that there will be other vaccines coming up and the more vaccines we get the better."" 
There are now 30 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO list classifies the Russian vaccine as being in Phase 1 trials.

The latest cluster, defined as five or more cases in close proximity, was traced to the Hinton James residence hall, UNC said Sunday. The individuals in the cluster have been identified. They are isolating and receiving medical monitoring, the university said.
On Saturday, UNC announced a cluster of coronavirus cases at the Sigma Nu fraternity. And on Friday, the university identified a cluster at the Ehringhaus Community, a residence hall, and at the Granville Towers, a private apartment complex that serves as a housing option for some students.
The clusters illustrate the challenges of reopening schools and bringing people into close proximity while Covid-19 continues to spread widely through the state and country. North Carolina has a seven-day average of about 1,200 new coronavirus cases per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Young people generally have less severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection, but they are not immune to the virus and can spread it to others.

Once production is fully ramped up, the company expects to print up to 3,000 parts per day.
“Formlabs’ EUA for BiPAP adapters signifies the need for these components and 3D printings' unique ability to fill that need. 3D printing enables rapid iteration and prototyping of new, innovative medical equipment, while expediting the production process, shortening supply chains, and allowing for localized manufacturing,” said Max Lobovsky, Formlabs CEO and co-founder.
Lobovsky noted that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA had only authorized a handful of EUAs. In March, Abbott received the rush-approval for its toaster-sized lab-in-a-box, and recently, NASA’s ventilator design was approved through the fast-track authorization.
While companies from Tesla to Dyson and NVIDIA have explored new ways to manufacture ventilators, pivoting manufacturing to make the devices is difficult and requires a lot of expertise. Plus, all ventilators have to clear regulatory hurdles and require creating new supply chains. Solutions like Formlabs’ adapter and right-to-repair efforts to prolong the life of existing equipment may be more practical."

And businesses that are helping make those transactions work are doubling down.
DispatchTrack, which provides a platform for last-mile deliveries, specifically to help companies mimic Amazon-like experiences for themselves by planning and tracking deliveries more easily, has closed a $144 million investment, its first-ever funding after scaling up as a bootstrapped startup to support more than 60 million deliveries per year.
The funding is coming from a single, high-profile investor, Spectrum Equity. It is being termed by the company as an investment rather than an acquisition, although I’ll note here that PitchBook has also described it alternately as a leveraged buyout in its database.
DispatchTrack was founded in 2010 in San Jose by a husband and wife team — Satish Natarajan (now CEO) and Shailu Satish (now COO) — who also happened to work in tech, after the pair grew frustrated with how badly home delivery services worked for themselves.
DispatchTrack today works with retail and wholesale companies across a number of verticals including furniture and appliance businesses, food distributors, healthcare companies, consumer retailers, and building suppliers, as well as field service businesses and third-party logistics (3PL) providers that use DispatchTrack to power their services. The company equips its customers including retailers, wholesalers, grocers, restaurants, food and beverage distributors, field service businesses, third-party logistics (3PL) companies and others
The platform itself is a kind of all-in-one logistics and delivery toolkit designed for ecosystems that include  physical storefronts, warehouses, drivers and end customers, which have a common thread running through them: the businesses are not fundamentally tech companies, yet may have staff who handle logistics; and they need technology to do their jobs — but don’t necessarily want to bring in more costly system integrators to develop or operate those systems on their behalf.
It includes features for managing routing and planning (including telematics and compliance), customer communication (including reservation systems for delivery slots), driver communication (via a mobile app), billing, social reviews, and omnichannel order tracking.
These services may not be the first that you think of when you consider products that you might buy to get delivered — you as a consumer are considering the product and its price and how fast you can get it, most likely — but they collectively constitute a huge part of the cost of providing the product, and typically are not done very well. (DispatchTrack cites CapGemini Research Institute that estimates that together they account for 41% of all supply chain costs.) It’s not the only company providing tools to fill these needs. Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Amazon and many others also provide software to retailers, but DispatchTrack would argue that its solution is the more comprehensive and focused solely on delivery and logistics.
[gallery ids=""1987262,1987263,1987264,1987265,1987266,1987267""]
“We are thrilled to partner with Spectrum Equity in this new stage of our growth, said Natarajan in a statement. We built DispatchTrack to help businesses large and small provide superior delivery experiences, streamline operations and maintain coordination and transparency across all constituents in the last mile. With Spectrums support, we will continue our rapid pace of innovation and be able to bring best-in-class solutions to more businesses, industries and geographies.
Choosing to pick up investment happened ahead of COVID-19 — it seems the first tranche of the funding was secured back in December 2019 — but it comes at a timely moment, when companies like Instacart are seeing all-time peaks of usage from customers who are no longer doing grocery shopping in physical stores because of the coronavirus outbreak. While DispatchTrack’s own trajectory was in place before now, this gives it an even stronger mandate to invest in growth.
“We look forward to supporting DispatchTracks commitment to solving complex problems by building elegant, powerful products that are easy to adopt, configure and scale, said Vic Parker, MD at Spectrum Equity, in a statement. The DispatchTrack platform is an exceptionally valuable solution for businesses that recognize the strategic imperative to optimize the delivery experience.

The March 20 event pulled in an impressive $4.3 million for artists, amounting to the biggest sales day in the platforms history. The earnings from music and merchandise amounted to 15x Bandcamps normal haul for a 24 period, with 11 items being sold per second. 
Earlier this week, the site said that it would continue to do so for the first Friday of the next three months. That includes June 5, July 3 and today. Don’t know where to start? Might I recommend checking out the new album Ultrasonic from Field Works? Its a lovely and engrossing ambient work built using field recordings of the endangered Indiana bats. Havent bats had it rough enough of late?
If you need further recommendations, 150 artists and labels are also participating in a number of different ways. Some, like Arts &amp; Crafts, Kill Rock Stars, Sub Pop, Saddlecreek, Merge and Matador are also giving all of the revenue to artists. Others like Cloud Nothings, Deerhoof and my personal favorite, The Hold Steady, have released new material. Others still like Cooking Vinyl and Sufjan Stevens are giving proceeds to related charity. Here’s the full list. 
Seems like a nice win-win all around. And hey, we could all use a little new music to get through this."

The parties seek to widen current COVID-19-related exemptions beyond beyond health products like ventilator and oxygen masks. The list includes wide ranging categories that serve important peripheral functions for frontline responders. 
These tariffs are not only a barrier to the entry of necessary products, they are a tax on businesses and consumers that has become ever more harmful as many enter survival mode, according to the letter provided to Reuters. 
The letter cites robotics, 3D printers, drones, personal computers and a number of different accessories, including monitors, printers and ink, citing medical professionals need for such material. A number of tech companies have pivoted to producing supplies amid the pandemic, from car makers manufacturing ventilators to apparel companies creating masks to 3D printing startups manufacturing parts. 
Also in the letter are elevator and escalator parts (per The National Elevator Industry, naturally) and various cleaning and disinfecting supplies (via The American Chemistry Council). Other categories include masks, networking equipment, hand sanitizer and hand dryers. 
The USTR has yet to issue an official response to exemptions for products  relevant to the medical response to the coronavirus. The CTA has been a vocal critic of Trump administration tariffs for some time. Last January, the association’s president Gary Shapiro told TechCrunch, The cost of the current tariffs remains an issue, and the uncertainty of potentially more tariffs combined with export controls is a real threat to our global leadership 5G, artificial intelligence and robotics.”"

The company has resumed operations in Orlando, Nashville, Columbus, Ohio and St. Louis. The ramp up of operations will depend on the city, the company said. In Columbus, Spin has deployed its entire 200-scooter fleet, the largest number allowed under the city’s permit. Spin is putting fewer scooters than permits allow in other cities. The company said it will scale up its scooter numbers based on demand.
Spin was operating in about 70 markets, a figure that includes college campuses and cities, up until the COVID-19 pandemic caused governments to issue stay-at-home orders. The company has maintained operations in some areas that have allowed it.
Spin said it has “enhanced” its safety protocols, which includes disinfecting scooters more often and requiring employees to wear gloves and face shields during their shifts.
The scooters are now disinfected every time they’re picked up for charging or enter a warehouse, the company said. Scooters with higher usage will be cleaned more frequently as much as twice a day or more, a spokesperson said when asked for more details.
At warehouses, where Spin scooters are maintained, charged and cleaned, workers are supplied with disinfectant materials to properly clean high-traffic surfaces between every shift. Employees also carry disinfectant materials with them out in the field to clean scooters on the spot.Spin said it has been working directly with cities to fill transportation gaps and deploy scooters where they are most needed.
Separately, the company said it has extended through May 31 a program that gives essential healthcare workers free 30-minute rides and helmets."

And then COVID-19 happened.
“We made the decision to fast-track the launch when the pandemic hit, because we felt like launching as a beta would really help the creative community,” Gittrich told me.
The startup was founded by Stacey Bendet and Joe Indriolo, who also serves as chief product officer. Indriolo told me that Creatively was designed to address a problem that Bendet had as founder and CEO of designer clothing company Alice + Olivia finding the best freelance creative talent to work with.
“Finding creatives is really, really difficult,” he said. “At the same time, showcasing your work is also really difficult as a creative.”
And those problems are likely to get worse as social distancing forces more creative work and collaboration to happen remotely, and as a troubled economy means that more artists, designers, architects, filmmakers and other creative types are looking for work.
There are places where artists can post their work, but Indriolo argued that none of them allow the creative to control the presentation in the same way not unless they’re building their own website.
Image Credits: Creatively
So Creatively says it’s designed to showcase photography, film, fashion design, branding, illustration, animation, CGI, app and web design, product development, interiors and architecture and emerging technologies.
Creative talent can upload their portfolio and arrange it as they choose. They can divide the work into different albums, and even nest albums within other albums in creative ways. (Indriolo showed me an architect’s album that allowed visitors to navigate their work by drilling down into specific regions and locations.)
Artists can also annotate the images and videos to explain their work, as well as listing their past jobs and their specific skills.
Brands and other potential employers can post job listings, which then get tagged with the artist who’s hired for the job, which in turn builds the artist’s résumé and portfolio. Brands can also search the site based on the skills they’re looking for, or based on who’s done work for another company that they admire.
The platform allows users to follow each other, but Indriolo said there’s an equal emphasis creating connections based on the work you’ve done and your past collaborations.
“We believe it’s a social platform, and that creatives will connect with one another … and find opportunities in a world that’s increasingly remote and global,” Gittrich added.
To get started, Creatively is working with schools like Parsons, Pratt, the Savannah College of Art and Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology to help their new graduates find work.
The platform is free for both businesses and individual creatives; the plan is to eventually start charging businesses to post jobs."

For one thing, it’s adding a new information category called virtual service offerings, which will allow businesses to showcase the fact that they’re providing things like virtual consultations, classes, tours and performances. Then anyone browsing Yelp can search for those categories.
The company said businesses are already starting to introduce virtual services to their profiles, particularly in the categories of home services, fitness, gyms, health and real estate. And Yelp plans to create new Collections that highlight businesses that are still open and providing these services.
In an email, Yelp’s consumer head of consumer product Akhil Kuduvalli told me:
With these new product updates, businesses of all types that are adapting and changing the way they operate will be able to better connect with their customers and potentially find new ones. Once business owners update their virtual service offerings on their Yelp for Business profiles, we will surface those updates to consumers through new call-to-action buttons, by updating the home screen and search results with links to groups of businesses offering these new virtual services, as well as surfacing them in other formats like Collections.

Yelp said it will soon add the ability for restaurants to identify the fact that they offer curbside pickup as well. (Apparently restaurants are already using existing features to adapt for example, Chili’s is using the Waitlist feature to manage diners making curbside pickups.)
Yelp (which has had to make cuts of its own in response to the pandemic) has also introduced a customized banner that it said has been used by nearly 224,000 businesses to post updates to their profiles. Now the banner is available to all businesses on Yelp for free.
Lastly, the company said it’s made its Connect feature for posting updates free to eligible local businesses as part of its $25 million relief efforts, and it’s introduced new Highlights that allow businesses to put relevant offerings like gift cards and delivery during the pandemic directly into their Yelp search results.
In a blog post announcing the changes, Kuduvalli wrote:
As government leaders across the country begin to map out plans for reopening local economies, we anticipate that the needs of consumers and businesses will gradually evolve. Were dedicated to listening to our community of local businesses and users as they continue to adapt, and will continue to create new ways to help them stay connected and safe during this unprecedented time."

Additionally, Lyft says it will provide cleaning supplies and masks for drivers.
Riders and drivers must all confirm they will cover their faces and not ride or drive with Lyft if they have COVID-19 or any symptoms. Drivers must also agree to keep their vehicles and hands clean and keep windows open when possible. Lastly, riders must agree to not ride in the front seat.
Before riding or driving, both riders and drivers will be prompted to confirm they will follow Lyft’s new personal health requirements. If a rider or driver repeatedly violates the order, their accounts will be subject to suspension.
“We believe being part of the Lyft community comes with shared responsibility,” Lyft VP of Global Operations Angie Westbrock said on a press call today. “When you wear a mask, you’re demonstrating to someone that you care about them… This helps give both sides — riders and drivers — that extra peace of mind during this time.”
So far, Lyft has dedicated $2.5 million to purchase hundreds of bottles of hand sanitizers and masks for drivers. To get these supplies, Lyft says it will notify drivers exactly where and when they will be able to pick them up. Lyft has so far provided individual drivers with one reusable mask and says it’s exploring partitions. Similarly, Uber began requiring riders and drivers to wear face coverings during rides.
Lyft’s efforts to make its rides safer comes shortly after Lyft laid off 982 employees and furloughed another 288 due to the global health crisis. Meanwhile, Lyft and Uber are facing a new lawsuit from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra over the alleged misclassification of drivers. The suit argues Uber and Lyft are depriving workers of the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities."

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 epidemic and the acceleration of the consumer adoption of telemedicine, along with the fragmentation of care to a number of different low-cost providers, access to a patient’s medical records to get an accurate picture of their health becomes even more important.
Opening access to developers also could unlock new, integrated services that could give consumers a better window into their own health and consumer product companies opportunities to develop new tools to improve health.
While hospitals, urgent care facilities and health systems have stored patient records electronically for years thanks to laws passed under the Clinton administration, those records were difficult for patients themselves to access. The way the system has been historically structured has made it nearly impossible for an individual to access their entire medical history.
It’s a huge impediment to ensuring that patients receive the best care they possibly can, and until now it’s been a boulder that companies have long tried to roll uphill, only to have it roll over them.
Now, new regulations are requiring that the developers of electronic health records can’t obstruct interoperability and access by applications. Those new rules may unlock a wave of new digital services.
At least that’s what companies like the New York-based startup Particle Health are hoping to see. The startup was founded by a former emergency medical technician and consultant, Troy Bannister, and longtime software engineer for companies like Palantir and Google, Dan Horbatt.
Particle Health is stepping into the breach with an API -based solution that borrows heavily from the work that Plaid and Stripe have done in the world of financial services. It’s a gambit that’s receiving support from investors including Menlo Ventures, Startup Health, Collaborative Fund, Story Ventures and Company Ventures, as well as angel investors from the leadership of Flatiron Health, Clover Health, Plaid, Petal and Hometeam.

“My first reaction when I met Troy, and he was describing what they’re doing, was that it couldn’t be done,” said Greg Yap, a partner with Menlo Ventures, who leads the firm’s life sciences investments. “We’ve understood how much of a challenge and how much of a tax the lack of easy portability of data puts on the healthcare system, but the problem has always felt like there are so many obstacles that it is too difficult to solve.”
What convinced Yap’s firm, Menlo Ventures, and the company’s other backers, was an ability to provide both data portability and privacy in a way that put patients’ choice at the center of how data is used and accessed, the investor said.
“[A service] has to be portable for it to be useful, but it has to be private for it to be well-used,” says Yap. 
The company isn’t the first business to raise money for a data integration service. Last year, Redox, a Madison, Wis.-based developer of API services for hospitals, raised $33 million in a later-stage round of funding. Meanwhile, Innovaccer, another API developer, has raised more than $100 million from investors for its own take.
Each of these companies is solving a different problem that the information silos in the medical industry presents, according to Patterson. “Their integrations are focused one-to-one on hospitals,” he said. Application developers can use Redox’s services to gain access to medical records from a particular hospital network, he explained. Whereas using Particle Health’s technology, developers can get access to an entire network.
“They get contracts and agreements with the hospitals. We go up the food chain and get contracts with the [electronic medical records],” said Patterson.
One of the things that’s given Particle Health a greater degree of freedom to acquire and integrate with existing healthcare systems is the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016. That law required that the providers of electronic medical records like Cerner and EPIC had to remove any roadblocks that would keep patient data siloed. Another is the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, which was just enacted in the past month.
“We don’t like betting on companies that require a change in law to become successful,” said Yap of the circumstances surrounding Particle’s ability to leapfrog well-funded competitors. But the opportunity to finance a company that could solve a core problem in digital healthcare was too compelling.
“What we’re really saying is that consumers should have access to their medical records,” he said.
Isometric Healthcare and technology concept banner. Medical exams and online consultation concept. Medicine. Vector illustration
This access can make consumer wearables more useful by potentially linking them — and the health data they collect — with clinical data used by physicians to actually make care and treatment decisions. Most devices today are not clinically recognized and don’t have any real integration into the healthcare system. Access to better data could change that on both sides.
“Digital health application might be far more effective if it can take into context information in the medical record today,” said Yap. “Thats one example where the patient will get much greater impact from the digital health applications if the digital health applications can access all of the information that the medical system collected.” 
With the investment, which values Particle Health at roughly $48 million, Bannister and his team are looking to move aggressively into more areas of digital healthcare services.
“Right now, we’re focusing on telemedicine,” said Bannister. “We’re moving into the payer space… As it stands today were really servicing the third parties that need the records. Our core belief is that patients want control of their data but they dont want the stewardship.”
The company’s reach is impressive. Bannister estimates that Particle Health can hit somewhere between 250 and 300 million of the patient records that have been generated in the U.S. “We have more or less solved the fragmentation problem. We have one API that can pull information from almost everywhere.”
So far, Particle Health has eight live contracts with telemedicine and virtual health companies using its API, which have pulled 1.4 million patient records to date.
“The way it works right now, when you give them permission to access your data its for a very specific purpose of use they can only use it for that one thing. Lets say you were using a telemedicine service. I allow this doctor to view my records for the purpose of treatment only. After that we have built a way for you to revoke access after the point,” Bannister said.
Particle Health’s peers in the world of API development also see the power in better, more open access to data. “A lot of money has been spent and a lot of blood and sweat went into putting [electronic medical records] out there,” said Innovaccer chief digital officer Mike Sutten.
The former chief technology officer of Kaiser Permanente, Sutten knows healthcare technology. “The next decade is about ‘let’s take advantage of all of this data.’ Let’s give back to physicians and give them access to all that data and think about the consumers and the patients,” Sutten said.
Innovaccer is angling to provide its own tools to centralize data for physicians and consumers. “The less friction there is in getting that data extracted, the more benefit we can provide to consumers and clinicians,” said Sutten.
Already, Particle Health is thinking about ways its API can help application developers create tools to help with the management of COVID-19 populations and potentially finding ways to ease the current lockdowns in place due to the disease’s outbreak.
“If youve had an antibody test or PCR test in the past we should have access to that data and we should be able to provide that data at scale,” said Bannister. 
“Theres probably other risk-indicating factors that could at least help triage or clear groups as well has this person been quarantined has this person been to the hospital in the past month or two things like that can help bridge the gap,” between the definitive solution of universal testing and the lack of testing capacity to make that a reality, he said. 
“Were definitely working on these public health initiatives,” Bannister said. Soon, the company’s technology — and other services like it — could be working behind the scenes in private healthcare initiatives from some of the nation’s biggest companies as software finally begins to take bigger bites out of the consumer health industry."

Now it’s trying to figure out what to do with the growing number of COVID-19 community groups on its platform worldwide. In hopes of better educating group admins, the company today began its first-ever digital event for those running COVID-19 groups. The event, “Community Connect: Navigating COVID-19,” takes place April 21-23 depending on timezone, and focuses on best practices for COVID-19 groups.
In the English portion of the event that ran today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, as is typical, positioned Facebook as a force for good.
“Its times like this when strong communities are needed most. With everything going on, I think the power of online communities in particular has really shined through and been clear, and you all are at the heart of this,” he said. “You are running groups that have helped to organize grocery delivery to older neighbors, groups where parents can share homeschooling tips, groups to source equipment and lifesaving information for healthcare workers, groups to support people who are now out of work or who have seen their businesses take a really big hit,” he continued.
“Even if not organizing directly around coronavirus yourself, your groups have provided an escape for people or a sounding board for people who need support and comfort during this time,” Zuckerberg added.
However, Facebook Groups have also contributed to the spread of misinformation, despite Facebook’s efforts to keep this content off its platform.
Just yesterday, for example, The WSJ reported on data from watchdog group NewsGuard which found that coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories remained highly available across Facebook, with some posts seeing thousands of likes and comments. The report also found that sites with millions of Facebook followers have been touting fake cures. Others spread conspiracies so bizarre they’d be laughable except for the fact they’ve led to real-world crime — as in the case of arson attacks on cell towers by those convinced a virus is spread by cell signals.
An earlier study by a different group examined over 100 pieces of debunked COVID-19 related misinformation, and found these posts were shared 1.7 million times and viewed 117 million times between Jan. 21 and April 7, VICE recently reported. When the report was published, 41% of the content was still live — indicating a failure in Facebook’s promises to remove this sort of COVID-19 misinformation.
The rapid growth Facebook Groups as a result of the coronavirus health crisis now makes it even more difficult to get a handle on this sort of content, as many groups operate privately.
In the U.S., more than 4.5 million people joined COVID-19 support groups on Facebook, the company announced today. Over 3 million have done the same in Italy and more than 2 million have in the U.K, Facebook said.
It’s true that many groups may be focused on community information and support — like those designed to help neighbors, support local businesses, or give to charitable organizations, for example. But Facebook groups can also be a private forum where misinformation is easily shared, without fact-checking.
And in a pandemic situation, misinformation and fake medical advice becomes even dangerous as people risk their own health and put others at risk, as well. These fake cures are not dubious supplements being hawked by your high school friend in an MLM — they’re useless and sometimes even dangerous fake cures — like drinking bleach or snorting cocaine.
Facebook has at least been trying to wedge in credible health information into groups.
Recently, it added a prompt for group admins to share live broadcasts about COVID-19 from credible health organizations like the WHO and official state and country health departments. And in partnership with the CDC, Facebook developed learning units based on CDC guidelines that admins are able to add to their group.
Coronavirus group members will also see an educational pop-up in the group itself, directing them to credible information from health organizations. Plus, coronavirus-related search will point to this same information.
“I can promise you that I can speak for everyone at Facebook when I say that it is our top priority to build products that can help everyone right now,” said Fidji Simo, Head of Facebook App, at today’s event. “Whether it is helping make sure you see the latest accurate information from credible health organizations, to helping to provide economic opportunity and stability to businesses who are struggling, to helping facilitate the growth of online communities at the local and global level,” Simo added.
Facebook’s real top priority, however, has been its money-making ad business, which captures a significant portion of its engineering resources, while moderation and fact-checking get outsourced. Without regulatory penalties for allowing dangerous information to spread, that will likely remain unchanged.
Facebook says it plans to host a number of digital events for group admins in the months ahead."

The news was shared as part of Ford’s quarterly earnings which was released after market closed Tuesday.
Ford is a bit different from other companies that have launched autonomous vehicle pilots in the United States. The automaker has been pursuing two parallels tracks that were supposed to eventually combine ahead of a planned commercial launch in 2021. The automaker is testing and honing in on what its AV business model might look like, while separately developing autonomous vehicle technology.
Argo AI,  the Pittsburgh-based company into which Ford invested $1 billion in 2017, is developing the virtual driver system and high-definition maps designed for Fords self-driving vehicles. Ford has been testing its go-to-market strategy through pilot programs with partners like Walmart,  Dominos and Postmates, and even some local businesses.
Ford said Tuesday that it needs to study the long-term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on customer behaviors.
Here is the statement from Ford in response to questions about its autonomous vehicle plans.
Given the challenges of the current business environment, as well as the need to evaluate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on customer behaviors, Ford made the decision to shift the launch of its self-driving services to 2022. Understanding customer behavior is a critically important part of building a new mobility service built around trust and making peoples lives easier. Taking the time to research changes in customer behaviors provides Ford with an opportunity to evaluate and potentially change our go-to-market strategy to meet new consumer demands. As part of this evaluation, we also want to make sure the customer experience we are building offers people peace of mind knowing they, or their packages, are in a safe and protected environment inside our vehicles.

Byton told TechCrunch the furloughs were the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is to bring these furloughed employees back, the company said without providing a timeline.
“Given the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the auto industries we, like several companies, have had to take action to face the challenge,” a Byton spokesperson wrote in an email to TechCrunch. “The furloughs have affected all areas within Bytons U.S. operations. Employees in China have not been furloughed.”
Electrek was the first to report the furloughs.
The furloughs come as the company is preparing to bring its M-Byte electric SUV into volume production later this year. The vehicle, perhaps best known for its massive 48-inch wraparound digital dashboard, will be produced at Byton’s factory in Nanjing, China. The M-Byte will be sold in China, the U.S. and Europe.
Byton previously said sales will begin in China in the second half of 2020, followed by the U.S. The vehicle will come to the first European markets in the first half of 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic – and the ensuing furloughs and cuts could delay Byton’s timeline.
Byton told TechCrunch is it evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on production of the M-Byte. Byton’s China factory reopened in mid-February and is now nearly fully operational, according to the company. 
Byton has raised about $820 million from investors that include the company’s founding team, FAW Group, Nanjing Qiningfeng New Energy Industry Investment Fund and CATL.
The startup has been working to close a Series C round of fundraising for months now. The company told TechCrunch it is in the “final stage” of the round, which will include investors FAW Group and the industrial investment fund of Nanjing municipal government, Myoung Shin Co. of South Korea MS Autotech and Japanese enterprise Marubeni Corporation ."

The issue pits public safety against personal privacy, but limited testing availability has rendered the question somewhat moot.
But as the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have noted, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers can spread the virus without realizing they’re infected. To learn more about workers’ rights in this arena, we spoke to Tricia Bozyk Sherno, counsel at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, who focuses on employment and general commercial litigation.
The answer, for now, is not entirely straightforward, though updates from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission could make the situation clearer going forward as more tests are made available and state governments begin pushing to reopen businesses.
Sherno offered a fair amount of insight into the EEOCs updated guidance and made some predictions about how things may look for both employers and workers going forward.
TechCrunch: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, what sorts of laws governed an employers ability to test employees for infectious diseases?
Tricia Bozyk Sherno: Covered employers (employers with 15 or more employees) must comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which limits an employer’s ability to make disability-related inquiries or require medical examinations. (Note that certain states may also have similar statutes in place.) Generally, disability-related inquiries and medical examinations are prohibited by the ADA except in limited circumstances. A “medical examination” is a procedure or test that seeks information about an individuals physical or mental impairments or health so infectious disease testing would fall into this category."

As schools around the world remain closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the new features are designed to let kids increase their contacts on the app under parental supervision.
The first new feature, called Supervised Friending, will launch today in the United States before other countries. Prior to Supervised Friending, kids needed to have their parents approve each of their Messenger Kids contacts. Supervised Friending lets parents turn on an option that allows their children to accept, reject, add and remove contacts. Parents are notified through Messenger and allowed to override any approvals through the Parent Dashboard.
The second new feature allows parents to approve other adults, like teachers, to add their kids to group chats. The third feature, now available in the U.S., Canada and Latin America, allows parents to make their childs profile name and photo visible to a circle of users that includes friends of their kids contacts and their parents, children of parents Facebook friends who also have Messenger Kids, and the children of people parents invite to download the app.
In its announcement, Facebook said the new features were developed with its Youth Advisors, an advisory group made up of child development, media and online safety experts. In February, the company introduced new tools and features that give parents more control over their childrens activity on Messenger Kids, including an activity log that makes it easier to see who they are chatting with and what they are sharing. But, as TechCrunchs Sarah Perez noted, Facebooks privacy policy still gives the company plenty of room to collect personal data."

The startup told TechCrunch that usage has doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the new platform, called HealthJoy 2.0, has been in the works for two years, it is now helping the company handle increased demand for services, including telemedicine.
Launched in 2014, HealthJoy now has more than 500 employers on its platform. It has raised a total of $53 million so far, including a $30 million Series C announced in February.
The new interface includes features that tell users expected wait times for services like its inbox and healthcare concierge, and a new benefits wallet. Last month, HealthJoy also added features to address the pandemic, including help to get testing, online consultations and a guide to nearby in-network healthcare facilities with low wait times.
Co-founder and CEO Justin Holland told TechCrunch that the platform “initially saw a huge spike in telemedicine visits as awareness of the virus grew and people started looking for ways to avoid physically visiting a doctors office. Usage for telemedicine has stabilized in the last couple of weeks and is now only a little bit above our baseline.”
He added that HealthJoy is now encouraging more employees to use the HealthJoy Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which helps them find services like mental health counseling, financial planning, and child and elder care assistance.
“Weve seen a corresponding spike in EAP utilization as people are seeking help,” he said.
HealthJoy 2.0s improvements, which moves more processing away from local clients to the cloud and includes an updated CRM and dashboard for employers, will also make it easier for the company to implement new features in the future.
Other health benefit engagement platforms include Collective Health, League and Lumity. Holland said that HealthJoy 2.0 will help the startup better compete by “allowing for greater integration with partners, a larger collection of APIs and easier integration with third-party data.”"

Virgin Orbit anticipates deliveries of the ventilator hardware to start “within the next few days” now that it has secured the agency’s authorization.
Virgin Orbit designed its ventilator, which is a take on an automated version of the manual resuscitators used most frequently in ambulances by paramedics responding to calls where a person has lost the ability to breath on their own, based on guidance form a group of experts and doctors called ‘The Bridge Ventilator Consortium.” It’s designed mostly as a stop-gap and supplement to free up use of proper ventilator hardware to treat the most severe respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients, but should still free up a valuable medical resources that are in short supply as the pandemic continues.
Already, Vrigin says it’s manufacturing the ventilators, and is making “over 100 per week” in terms of its ongoing production rate. The initial delivery set to go out this week will be 100 units that will be shipped to California’s Emergency Medial Services Authority, for distribution depending on need in that sate.
While it has done a lot to quickly ramp up this production line and start shipping ventilators, Virgin Orbit says that it’s been continuing to build out its own small satellite launch system. In fact, it just recently flew a key final test of its LauncherOne vehicle and the carrier aircraft that brings it to its launch altitude the last big step before it runs a full demonstration of its system, including an orbital flight, later this year."

Its been a bad year for the Vision Fund, with huge losses at WeWork and Uber due to corporate incompetence, intrigue, and of course, COVID-19.
But buried a bit in the footnotes of its financial statements is a note that the first Vision Fund officially closed its doors to new investments way back in September 2019 having exhausted all of its investible capital.
Per the notes, on September 12, 2019, the managing entity that owns the first Vision Fund determined that the fund had spent 85% of its capital, with the remainder reserved for follow-on investments and covering mandatory disbursements and fund management fees. That triggered the early ending of the fund, which was otherwise contractually allowed to invest until November 20, 2022.
To put that in perspective: the Vision Fund, which announced its first close on May 20, 2017, raised a total of $98.6 billion according to SoftBanks documents.
Which means that the fund spent $83.8 billion on investments and fees in just about 845 days.
Thats just shy of $100m per day.
Every day.
(Including weekends.)
The company last year unveiled its plans to launch a second, even larger Vision Fund totaling $108 billion but fundraising has been slow according to reports, and thats not likely to change given some of the other top line numbers SoftBank unveiled today about its Vision.
The Vision Fund officially lost $17.4 billion in value according to SoftBanks financials for the year ending this past March 31. The year before, SoftBank had registered a positive gain in the Vision Funds value of $12.8 billion, which means that the damage of this years performance has completely wiped out all gains the fund had made in the previous year.
But the real shock is the performance of the funds underlying portfolio companies. The Vision Fund currently has 88 active portfolio companies that have not exited. Of those, 19 investments saw a gain in combined value of $3.4 billion according to SoftBank, while 50 companies saw a decline in value aggregating to $20.7 billion in losses. 19 portfolio companies were left unchanged in value.
Its not uncommon for early-stage funds to see huge loss ratios of this sort, but it is extraordinarily rare within the context of a late-stage fund. Considering that these valuations were almost certainly assessed before COVID-19 fully unleashed its damage on the global economy, having 57% of portfolio companies drop in value in just one year is insane, particularly given that most of them were headed toward some form of exit in the short-to-medium term given their stage.
Thats not to say that there arent bright lights in the portfolio, or some realized wins. But ultimately, a portfolio is only as good as its parts, and right now, those parts dont look all that good."

The latest of such efforts comes from Huami, the NASDAQ-listed wearables startup that makes Xiaomi’s Mi Bands and sells its own fitness tracking watches under the Amazfit brand in more than 70 countries. In a phone interview with TechCrunch, the firm said it is developing a see-through plastic mask with built-in ultraviolet lights that can disinfect filters within 10 minutes when connected to a power supply through a USB port.
The Aeri concept comes with built-in ultraviolet lights that can disinfect filters within 10 minutes when connected to a power supply through a USB port.
Called Aeri, the mask uses removable filters that are on par with N95 filtration capacity. If the concept materializes, each filter could last up to a month and a half, significantly longer than the average life of surgical masks and N95 respirators. The modular design allows for customized accessories such as a fan for breathable comfort, hence the mask’s name Aeri, a homophone of “airy”.
Aeri started from the premise that wearing masks could thwart the increasingly common adoption of facial recognition. That said, imaging companies have been working on biometric upgrades to allow analyses of other facial features such as irises or the tip of noses.
Aeri might still have a market appeal though, argued Pengtao Yu, vice president of industrial design at Huami. “Whether people need to unlock their phones or not, they want to see each other’s faces at social occasions,” said Yu, the California-based Chinese designer who had served clients including Nest Labs, Roku, GoPro and Huawei prior to joining Huami.
Huami’s U.S. operation, which focuses on research and development, opened in 2014 and now counts a dozen of employees.
Many companies turning to pandemic-fighting manufacturing have taken a hit from their core business, but Huami has managed to stay afloat. Its Q1 revenue was up 36% year-over-year to hit $154 million, although net income decreased to $2.7 million from $10.6 million. Its stocks have been declining, however, sliding from a high point of $16 in January to around $10 in mid-May.
Huami is in the process of prototyping the Aeri masks. In Shenzhen, which houses the wearables company’s headquarters, the development cycle for hardware products — from ideation to market rollout — takes as short as 6-12 months thanks to the city’s rich supply chain resources, said Yu.
Huami hasn’t priced Aeri at this early stage, but Yu admitted that the masks are targeting the “mass consumer market” around the world, not only for protection against viruses but also everyday air pollution, rather than appealing to medical workers. Given Huami’s history of making wearables at thin margins, it won’t be surprising that Aeri will be competitively priced.
The Aeri project is part of Huami’s pivot to enter the general health sector beyond pure fitness monitoring. The company has recently teamed up with a laboratory led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, the public face of China’s fight against COVID-19, to track respiratory diseases using wearables. It’s also in talks with the German public health authority to collaborate on a smartwatch-powered virus monitoring app, the company told TechCrunch."

Now the San Francisco-based startup is using the capital to hire talent and scale the development of its software stack as it aims for commercial operations later this year pending FAA approvals.
The company announced Wednesday its Series A funding round, which was led by R7 Partners, with participation from early-stage VC Alven, Eniac Ventures and Thales Corporate Ventures. Xwing has already hired several key executives with that fresh injection of capital, including Terrafugia’s former co-founder and COO Anna Dietrich and Ed Lim, a Lockheed Martin and Aurora Flight Sciences veteran who more recently led guidance navigation and control for Uber’s autonomous car division as well as Zipline’s AV delivery drone.
Xwing is different from some of the other autonomous aviations startups that have popped up in recent years. The startup isnt building autonomous helicopters and planes. Instead, its focused on the software stack that will enable pilotless flight of small passenger aircraft.
Xwing is also aircraft agnostic. The company’s engineers are focused on the key functions of autonomous flight, such as sensing, reasoning and control. The software stack, which is designed to work across different kinds of aircraft, is integrated into existing aerospace systems. That strategy of retrofitting existing aircraft will speed up deployment, while maintaining safety and keeping costs in check, according to founder and CEO Marc Piette. It also is a straighter path towards regulatory approval.
“It’s more effective for us to not constrain ourselves to a given vehicle and to develop technology that is considered more of an enabler from a marketing perspective than going full stack, Piette said when asked if Xwing would ever try to build an autonomous aircraft from the groundup.
Since Xwing’s last funding round $4 million in summer 2018 the company has been developing its tech and working with the FAA to receive flight certification for pilotless aircraft. Once approved, the company will seek to commercialize pilotless flights.
The startup hasn’t named any commercial partners yet. And Piette hasn’t provided details about its commercial strategy either, although he said to expect more announcements this year.
Xwing is already working with Bell for NASA’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS in the NAS) program, an initiative meant to mature the key remaining technologies that are needed to integrate unmanned aircraft in U.S. airspace. The program plans to hold demonstration flights this summer."

The company’s personalized automated chat asks about employees’ potential exposure to the novel coronavirus and then asks about potential symptoms.
Once employees complete the survey they are either cleared to go into work and receive a digital badge that they’ve taken the check up, or are instructed to stay home and receive some information on how to take care of themselves and monitor their condition for changes.
There is no real choice between reopening for business and keeping the spread of coronavirus in checkwe must do both, said Murray Brozinsky, Conversas chief executive, in a statement. As businesses and schools anticipate getting back to work in their physical locations, it is absolutely vital that they create a healthy and safe environment for all returning employees, students and visitors.
Healthcare organizations like Northwell Health, UCSF Health, UNC Health and Prisma Health are already using the company’s technology, according to a statement. At these institutions, Conversa has provided symptom checking and triage, check-ins with quarantined patients and delivering lab results to millions of patients, and screening hundreds of thousands of employees over the last month.
The screener was developed in conjunction with the University of California San Francisco Health.
We needed to safely screen while minimizing delays for our employees, visitors, and others caring for patients, said Aaron Neinstein, MD, Director of Clinical Informatics, UCSF Center for Digital Health Innovation, in a statement. Conversas virtual care and communication solution was flexible and scalable to help us create a user-centered solution, while modernizing our processes for how we engage and care for our employees. It’s been working great for us and were extending use to our employees across the UCSF campus I think employers across many other industries will find themselves wanting to use a tool like Conversa to help create a safe workplace and ensure they have healthy employees."

One such tech solution launching today comes from Brian McClendon, co-founder of Keyhole, the company that Google purchased in 2004 that would form the basis of Google Earth and Google Maps. McClendon’s new CVKey Project is a registered non-profit that is launching with an app for symptom self-assessment that generates a temporary QR code which will work with participating community facilities as a kind of health ‘pass’ on an opt-in basis.
Ultimately, CVKey Project hopes to launch an entire suite of apps dedicated to making it easier to reopen public spaces safely, including apps for things like exposure notification, which is what Apple and Google have partnered to deliver a framework for that works across both of their mobile operating systems. CVKey is also going to be providing information about what types of facilities are open under current government guidelines, as well as what those places are doing in terms of their own policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible.
The core element of CVKey Project’s approach, however, is use of a QR code generated by its app that essentially acts as a verification that you’re ‘safe’ to enter one of these shared spaces. The system is designed with user privacy in mind, according to McClendon any identify or health data exists only on a user’s individual device, and they’re never uploaded to a cloud server or shared without a user’s consent and information provided about what that sharing entails. All users only voluntarily offer their own health info, and the app never asks for location information. Most of what it does can be done without an internet connection at all, in fact, McClendon explains.
When you generate a QR code for use at places that have opted in to participate in the system, they scan it and receive a simple binary indicator of whether or not you’re cleared to pass, based on the policies they’ve set. They don’t see any specifics about your health information the code transmits all the particulars of whether you have shown symptoms, which ones and how recently, for instance, and then that is matched against the policy set for the particular public space and they provide a go/no-go response.
McClendon created CVKey Project together with Manik Gupt and Waleed Kadous, who he worked with previously at Google Earth, Google Maps and Uber, as well as Dr. Marci Nielsen, a public health specialist with a long history of leadership at both public and private institutions.
The apps created by CVKey Project will be available soon, and the non-profit is looking for potential partners to participate in its program. Like just about everything else designed to address the COVID-19 crisis, it’s not a simple fix, but it could form part of a larger strategy that provides a path forward for dealing with the pandemic."

The company is called Apeel Sciences and over the past eight years it’s grown from a humble startup launched with a $100,000 grant from the Gates Foundation to a giant, globe-spanning company worth more than $1 billion and attracting celebrity backers like Oprah Winfrey and Katy Perry as well as large multi-national investors like Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.
What’s drawn these financiers and the fabulously famous to invest is the technology that Apeel has developed which promises to keep food fresh for longer periods on store shelves, which prevents waste and (somewhat counterintuitively) encourages shoppers to buy more vegetables.
At least, that’s the pitch that Apeel Sciences founder and chief executive James Rogers has been making for the last eight years. It’s netted his company roughly $360 million in total financing and attracted investors like Upfront Ventures, S2G Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Powerplant Ventures.
“The [food] system is taxed beyond its limit,” says Rogers. “We view our job at Apeel to build the food system and support the weight of a couple of more billion people on the planet.”
Rogers started working on the technology that would become the core of Apeel’s product while pursuing his doctorate at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The first-time entrepreneur’s epiphany came on the road from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory where he was working as an intern.
Driving past acres of California cropland, Rogers surmised that the problem with the food supply network that exists wasn’t necessarily the ability to produce enough food, it was that much of that food is spoiled and wasted between where it’s grown and where it needs to be distributed.
In the past, farmers had turned to pesticides to prevent disease and infestations that could kill crops and preservative methods like single-use plastic packaging or chemical treatments that had the seeds of other environmental catastrophes.
“We’re out of shortcuts,” says Rogers. “Single use plastic had its day and pesticides had their day.” For Rogers, it’s time for Apeel’s preservative technologies to have their day.
With all the new cash in Apeel’s coffers, Rogers said that the company would begin expanding its operations and working with the big farming companies and growers in Africa, Central America and South America. “To maintain 52 weeks of supply on shelves we need to have operations in the Northern and Southern hemispheres,” Rogers said.
For all of the company’s lofty goals, the company is working with a relatively limited range of produce — avocados, asparagus, lemons and limes. Still, the pitch — and Rogers’ vision — is much broader. “Lets take what the orange knows and teach it to the cucumber so that it doesnt have to be wrapped in plastic,” says Rogers. “When you reduce that waste theres a ton of economic value that is unlocked.”
Right now, the way the business works is through convincing retailers about all that economic value that’s waiting to be unlocked.
In practice, once a company agrees to try out Apeel’s technology it installs the company’s treatment systems at the back end of its supply chain where all of their vegetable deliveries come in to be shipped to various locations, according to Rogers.
A single run of Apeel’s system can treat 10,000 kilograms of food in an hour, Rogers said. So far this year, Apeel is on track to treat 20 million pieces of fruit with its coatings, the company said. 
Apeel Sciences is already working with food retailers in the U.S. and Europe. On average, grocers that use Apeel have experienced a 50% reduction in shrink, a 5-10% growth in dollar sales, and an incremental 10% growth in dollar sales when sold in conjunction with in-store marketing campaigns, the company said. 
Food waste is an invisible tax imposed on everyone that participates in the food system. Eliminating global food waste can free up $2.6 trillion annually, allowing us to make the food ecosystem better for growers, distributors, retailers, consumers and our planet,” said Rogers in a statement. “Together, were putting time back on the industrys side to help deal with the food waste crisis and the challenges it poses to food businesses."

While tech has been among the most resilient industries in the face of this cataclysm, the extreme mobility of the industrys workforce begs large questions about what the future of startups and work will look like moving forward.
We’ve debated what COVID-19 will do to the rise of the college town as startup hubs and how the pandemic will change the way we work in coffee shops and neighborhoods. Now, we want to address one of the larger questions that has been bugging us: Will tech continue to centralize in hubs like San Francisco and New York City, or will remote work and all the other second-order effects lead to a more decentralized startup ecosystem?
We have three perspectives from our writers, with wildly different predictions about what the future has in store.
First, we have Danny Crichton, who believes that tech, and particularly the VC industry, will remain as concentrated as ever, although where it is concentrated will perhaps shift a bit. Meanwhile, Alex Wilhelm asserts that startup growth outside major hubs will actually accelerate, spreading tech wealth even farther outside the metropolises. Finally, Natasha Mascarenhas argues that the combination of the economic dislocation of COVID-19 and the increasing attention to equity in tech will lead to more intense investment outside core startup hubs.
First there was Sand Hill Road. Then there was South Park. And now theres Solbar at Solage in Calistoga.
Despite the wide availability of remote work tools over the past two decades, VCs have always miraculously congregated in extraordinarily tight quarters. VCs werent attracted to Sand Hills low-slung office buildings for the architecture, which were and are a terror to eyes with a taste for anything more sophisticated than here be four walls and a roof. VCs didnt head to South Park to enjoy what Google Maps calls a “tree-lined oval garden” nestled between light industrial buildings. And they arent heading to Solbar in Napa Valley for Californian cuisine and a dining room conveniently closed on Partner Mondays."

But in a global economy that had become drunk and lazy on just in time ordering and similar, the threat to supply chains of things like, oh, food, from that pesky virus has become real and visceral. That why automation of ‘the supply chain’ has become such a huge issue. So its not a huge surprise that startups aimed at tackling this are suddenly thrust into the limelight.
Step forward, Cork, Ireland-based Keelvar, strategic sourcing software company, which today announces that it has raised $18 million in Series A funding led by Elephant and Mosaic Ventures with participation from Paua Ventures, enabling the company to further expand into enterprise markets.
The investment will support Keelvars expansion plans for Europe and the US, amid the rapidly-growing need for supply chain automation solutions, which has been further accelerated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
Keelvar provides large enterprises with ‘Advanced Sourcing Optimization’ software and ‘Intelligent Sourcing Automation’ that uses AI to fully automate tactical buying processes.
It competes with Coupa and Jaggaer in terms of all three offering sophisticated eSourcing software. Keelvar says its key competitive advantage is that it provide intelligent bots to autopilot the sourcing projects, thus making the whole process easier, faster and cheaper.
It also currently manages over $90bn in spend annually for enterprises in all major industries. Customers include Siemens, Coca-Cola, Novartis, BMW, and Samsung.
With COVID-19 disrupting supply chains globally, Keelvar expects the demand for automation to further increase.
In a statement Alan Holland, CEO of Keelvar said:”The Future of Work in procurement is changing quickly, with COVID19 acting as a catalyst. We have witnessed an escalation in demand from enterprises seeking intelligent systems to automate complex processes as teams became overburdened with disrupted supply chains. Keelvar has proven that Sourcing Bots can relieve that burden enormously. Now its time to hit the accelerator and scale-up.
Speaking about the investment, Peter Fallon, partner at Elephant noted: Keelvars sourcing optimization and automation software delivers meaningful ROI to enterprise sourcing and procurement organizations globally. We are excited to partner with Alan Holland and the team at Keelvar as the company continues to emerge as a leader in this market.
Private sector companies alone spend trillions annually buying from third-party suppliers. External sourcing is usually the largest expense category and on average it is 43% of total costs (Bain &amp; Company). The global procurement software market is currently growing at a CAGR of 9.1%, and expected to reach $7.3 billion by 2022 (IDC).
Speaking about the funding, Toby Coppel, co-founder, and partner at Mosaic Ventures said: Keelvar is a brilliant example of machine learning in action, giving superpower to procurement teams in every large enterprise. With COVID-19 pushing businesses to embrace these new technologies, we’re excited to partner with Keelvar on the next phase of growth."

Box has been speeding up its product roadmap to help companies who are in the midst of this transition. Today, the company announced the Box Relay template library, which includes a series of workflow templates to help customers build digital workflows faster.
Box CEO Aaron Levie says that the rapid shift to work from home has been a massive accelerant to digital transformation, in some cases driving years of digital transformation into a matter of weeks and months. He says that has made the need to digitize business processes more urgent than ever.
In fact, when he appeared on Extra Crunch Live last month, he indicated that businesses still have way too many manual processes:
We think were [in] an environment that anything that can be digitized probably will be. Certainly as this pandemic has reinforced, we have way too many manual processes in businesses. We have way too slow ways of working together and collaborating. And we know that were going to move more and more of that to digital platforms.
Box Relay is the company’s workflow tool, and while it has had the ability to create workflows, it required a certain level of knowledge and way of thinking to make that happen. Levie says that they wanted to make it as simple as possible for customers to build workflows to digitize manual processes.
“We are announcing an all new set of Box Relay templates, which are going straight to the heart of how do you automate and digitize business processes across the entire enterprise and make it really simple to do that,” he explained.
This could include things like a contract review, change order process or budget review to name a few examples. The template includes the pieces to get going, but the customer can customize the process to meet the needs of the individual organization’s requirements.
Image Credits: Box
While this is confined to Box-built templates for now, Levie says that down the road this could include the ability for customers to deploy templates of their own, or even for third parties like systems integrators to build industry or client-specific templates. But for today, it’s just about the ones you get out of the box from Box.
At the same time, the company is announcing the File Request feature, a name Levie admits doesn’t really do the feature justice. The idea is that in a workflow such as a paperless bank loan process, the individual has to submit multiple documents without having a Box account. After the company receives the documents, it can kick off a workflow automatically based on receiving the set of documents.
He says the combination of these two new capabilities will give customers the ability to digitize more and more of their processes and bring in a level of automation that wasn’t previously possible in Relay. “The combination of these two features is about driving automation across the entire enterprise and digitizing many more paper-based and manual processes in the enterprise,” Levie said.
Box will not be charging additional fees for these new features to customers using Box Relay. File Request should be available at the end of this month, while the template library should be available by the end of July, according to the company."

The companys efforts have had mixed success, however, due in part to the sheer volume of vendors that utilize the companys massive commerce platform. In a suit filed in California this week, 3M claims the seller was charging massively inflated prices for either damaged or counterfeit products. 
3M alleges that the defendants charged prices for the fraudulent respirators that exceeded as much as 20 times 3Ms N95 respirator list prices, the company writes. Amazon learned that the defendants misrepresented what would be delivered for these exorbitant prices, and that buyers had received non-3M respirators, fewer items than purchased, products in suspect packaging, and defective or damaged items. Amazon has blocked the accounts on its platform.
N95 masks have become one of the most in-demand pieces of PPE during the ongoing crisis, due to their extreme filtration efficacy. The CDC recommends the respirators versus surgical masks, due to their ability to filter out small particles. The latter is mostly effective for large droplets and fluid. N95 masks, on the other hand, are capable of filtering out more than 95% of large and small air particles. For that reason, many groups have insisted the equipment be reserved for front-line responders.
Amazon confirmed its involvement in the suit, telling TechCrunch, There is no place for counterfeiting or price gouging on Amazon and were proud to be working with 3M to hold these bad actors accountable. Amazon has longstanding policies against counterfeiting and price gouging and processes in place to proactively block suspicious products and egregious prices. When we find a bad actor violating our policies, we work quickly to remove the products and take action on the bad actor, as weve done here, and we welcome collaboration from brands like 3M.
The site says it has removed more than half a million product offers and suspended more than 6,000 accounts over price gouging. In its own release, 3M claims to have been involved in the removal of more than 3,000 sites featuring counterfeit products or deceitful claims."

The movie theater giant warned of losses reaching up to $2.4 billion, courtesy of COVID-19-related closures, adding that “substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.”
AMC isn’t alone. The pandemic has had a devastating impact on theaters that rely on in-person foot traffic for the vast majority of their income. And as they’ve waited to reopen, some theaters have marked the time with mournful marquees and virtual screenings.
Now, as America begins the slow, deliberate process of reopening, movie theaters have outlined their own plans to return to normal. But it seems clear that like so many other industries, the theatrical movie business remains very uncertain.
The process will come in stages and take into account guidance from bodies like the CDC and state and local officials, as the indoor, close-quartered setups are particularly susceptible to potential transmission of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.
Its clear that theater owners and industry shareholders are eager to start working again, but a much larger and more important question remains: Are Americans ready to return to theaters? After months of hearing about the risks of transmission, coupled with the viruss harrowing symptoms, the cost-benefit analysis is a difficult one for movie fans who consider the theater experience a simple and essential life pleasure.
Along with the theaters’ own precautions, states will be implementing additional restrictions. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom issued guidelines under which theaters can reopen starting on June 12. Those guidelines include allowing 25% of theater capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees per theater whichever is lower. Theater owners should:
Reconfigure, close, or otherwise remove seats from use to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between attendees. This may require seating every other row or blocking off or removing seats in a checkerboard style (use each row but make sure no one is directly behind other patrons) so that distances are maintained in all directions. Members of the same household may be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other households.
Face coverings will be mandatory and theaters are encouraged to use disposable seat covers. Public water fountains will be turned off, doors should be propped open and the flow of traffic needs to be established. Its not exactly a carefree film-going experience, but precautions should be welcomed.
Its been nearly three months since AMC closed all of its locations. In July, the countrys largest theater chain plans to reopen almost all of its U.S. and U.K. locations, information that marked a rare bit of positive news for the companys stock, which jumped 14% last Wednesday. AMC CEO Adam Aron said the chain plans to reopen 97-98% of its theaters by the middle of next month, though he added that the companys plans are fluid a fair assessment, given the ever-changing nature of our knowledge about COVID-19. (For one thing, New York City  the country’s second-largest movie market does not yet have a date for reopening theaters.)
Similarly, Cinemark says that it plans to reopen its theaters across the U.S. in four phrases, with the first phase starting on June 19. And the National Association of Theatre Owners an industry trade organization put global theater reopening at between 90 and 95%, globally during the same time frame.
The timing isnt accidental. Christopher Nolans upcoming “Tenet” is set for a July 17 release. The Warner Bros. film, with a reported budget of more than $200 million, will serve as something of a trial balloon, to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks for cautious film fans. 
Other studios have begun announcing plans to reenter the market as well, including Sony/TriStars Selena Gomez vehicle, “The Broken Hearts Gallery,” which is slated for a July 1 release an extremely optimistic gamble for the studios. But given Nolans blockbuster track record, and his devotion to the theatrical experience, “Tenet” is largely regarded as the true bellwether for the industry, followed by Disney’s delayed release of “Mulan” on July 30.
The pandemic prompted studios to launch theatrical films like Pixars “Onward” to VOD and streaming services much more quickly than usual, as well as circumventing theaters entirely for releases like “The Lovebirds” and “Artemis Fowl.” For the most part, studios have treated this as a temporary strategy, but NBCUniversal has been particularly bullish about the VOD success of “Trolls World Tour,” leading to tension with theater owners.
Can a big-budget Hollywood film make a profit if theaters are operating at reduced capacity? Analysts have suggested that it might work, since theaters were rarely at full capacity before the pandemic (particularly on weekdays). And with no other big releases to compete with during their initial weeks of releases, “Tenet” and “Mulan” will be able to run on many more screens than normal.
But that’s assuming moviegoers will come out, while many are wondering whether the pandemic represents the beginning of a new normal for an industry already struggling to cope with shifting consumer desires.
For example, a new study from Performance Research and Full Circle Research Co. points to a population that isnt exactly rushing to get their butts back into seats. Seventy percent of respondents said they would rather watch a movie at home versus the theater if both options were available now. Compare that to 13% who chose the theater option. Naturally, things will likely shift in one direction over the course of the next month, and year, but such figures are at least troubling for theater chains.
How soon would you consider seeing a movie in theaters again?
— Brian Heater (@bheater) June 10, 2020
Similarly, we conducted an extremely non-scientific Twitter poll, asking readings when they would consider seeing a movie in theaters. Of the 2,445 people who have responded to the still ongoing poll as of press time, 41% said they would wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, 23% plan to wait for next year and 20% and 15.3% chose this summer and fall/winter, respectively. It’s not a precise metric by any measure, but it does speak to a public set to approach such activities with an abundance of caution.
The entire industry will be watching the performance of films like “Tenet” closely. If those early trial balloons fail to fly, it will spell more difficult times ahead for Hollywood."

A number of European countries have launched contacts tracing apps at this point, with the aim of leveraging smartphone technologies in the fight against COVID-19, but none of these apps can yet work across national borders.
Last month, EU Member States agreed to a set of interoperability guidelines for tracing apps. Now they’ve settled on a technical spec for achieving cross-border working of apps. The approach has been detailed in a specification document published today by the eHealth Network.
The Commission has called the agreement on a tech spec an important step in the fight against COVID-19, while emphasizing tracing apps are only a supplement to manual contacts tracing methods.
Commenting in a statement, European commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said: As we approach the travel season, it is important to ensure that Europeans can use the app from their own country wherever they are travelling in the EU. Contact tracing apps can be useful to limit the spread of coronavirus, especially as part of national strategies to lift confinement measures.
The system will involve a Federation Gateway Service, run by the Commission, that will receive and pass on “relevant information” from national contact tracing apps and servers — in order to minimise the amount of data exchanged and reduce users’ data consumption, per a Commission press release.
From the tech spec:
The pattern preferred by the European eHealth Network is a single European Federation Gateway Service. Each national backend uploads the keys of newly infected citizens (‘diagnosis keys’) every couple of hours and downloads the diagnosis keys from the other countries participating in this scheme. Thats it. Data conversion and filtering is done in the national backends.
“The proximity information shared between apps will be exchanged in an encrypted way that prevents the identification of an individual person, in line with the strict EU guidelines on data protection for apps; no geolocation data will be used,” the Commission added.
The key caveat attached to the agreed interoperability system is that it currently only works to link up decentralized contacts tracing apps — such as the Corona-Warn-App launched today by Germany — or the national apps recently released in Italy, Latvia and Switzerland.
Centralized coronavirus contacts tracing apps — which do not store and process proximity data locally on the device but upload it to a central server for processing, such as France’s StopCovid app; the UK’s NHS COVID-19 app; or the currently suspended Norwegian Smittestopp app — will not immediately be able to plug into the interoperability architecture, as we explained in our report last month.
Apple and Google’s joint API for coronavirus exposure notifications also only supports decentralized tracing apps.
“This document presents the basic elements for interoperability for ‘COVID+ Keys driven solutions’ [i.e. decentralized tracing systems],” notes the eHealth Network. “It aims to keep data volumes to the minimum necessary for interoperability to ensure cost efficiency and trust between the participating Member States. This document is therefore addressed only to Member States implementing this type of protocol.”
The Commission has been calling for a common approach to the use of tech and data to fight COVID-19 for months. However national governments have not fallen uniformly into line — with, still, a mixture of decentralized and centralized approaches for tracing apps in play (although the former now comprise “the great majority of national approved apps”, per the Commission).
It’s also playing the diplomat — saying it “continues to support the work of Member States on extending interoperability also to centralised tracing apps”.
Although it has not provided any detail on how that might be achieved in a way that’s satisfactory for both app architecture camps, given associated privacy risks/security trade-offs of crossing opposing technical streams.
This means that citizens in European countries whose governments have chosen a centralized approach for coronavirus contacts tracing may find, on traveling elsewhere in the region, they will need to download another country’s national app to be able to receive and send coronavirus exposure notifications.
Even decentralized national apps aren’t able to exchange relevant data yet, though. The interoperability architecture’s gateway interface still needs to be deployed — and national apps launched and/or updated before all the relevant pieces can start talking. So there’s a way to go before any digital contacts tracing is working smoothly across European borders.
Meanwhile, some EU countries have already started to reopen their borders to other European countries — ahead of a wider reopening planned for the summer.
This week, for example, a few thousand German holidaymakers were allowed to travel to Spain’s Balearic Islands as part of a trial aimed at restarting tourism. So EU citizens are already flowing across borders before national apps are in a position to securely exchange data on exposure risk."

Today, a startup that’s building out a suite of services related to that is announcing a round of funding on the back of a boost of growth in business.
Farewill, a UK startup that provides a platform for people write online wills, organise probate services (such as sorting out death duties and taxes on a person’s property) and order cremations, has raised £20 million ($25 million) in funding — money that it hopes will not only help the company grow its business but also to help in the process of coping with our own deaths and those of our loved ones.
“We want to help by destigmatising death,” said Farewill CEO Dan Garrett in an interview about the complexity of the proposition. “We all have to face death. It lives inside everyone. But for most of us, we are psychologically hardwired not to think about it, and as a process people have been largely at the behest of an industry that doesnt think about its customers.”
The name is, as you may have guessed, a play on farewell. “Think of the pun, and you can start the company,” Garrett said with the hint of wryness in his voice that I’m not sure you can avoid at the moment, especially given the subject.
The round is being led by Highland Europe, with Keen Ventures, Rich Pierson of Headspace, Broadhaven Ventures, Venture Founders and previous investors Augmentum Fintech, Taavet Hinrikus of TransferWise and Kindred Capital also participating. It’s being described as a venture round — a Series A of just under $10 million was closed in January 2019 — and brings the total raised by Farewill to £30 million.
Farewill is currently only live in the UK but longer term has plans to expand to more. In its home market, Garrett (who co-founded the company with university friend Dan Rogers, who is the CTO and CPO) says that in the five years that Farewill has been operational, it’s become the biggest will writer in the country in what is a quite fragmented market: the startup accounts for one out of every 10 wills written, or a 10% market share.
The cremation funeral and probate services are more recent launches from December 2019. But even so, given the current state of play with lockdown, social distancing and sadly the rise in actual deaths, they too have seen a lot of activity. Garrett said that Farewill’s cremation service, where the order for cremation and other details are all carried out online and costs on average one-fifth of the typical funeral — the idea being that families can then choose how to memorialise after that process, bypassing that more traditional funeral option — is now the third/fourth-biggest cremation provider in the country. It’s not all about the last few months, however: overall growth for the startup, he added, was 800% last year (before COVID-19) on a revenue basis.
Just as death is not an easy topic for most people, it’s a complicated one to pinpoint as a target industry for a startup to “disrupt.” Farewill’s origin story, in that context, is an interesting one.
Garrett — who studied engineering at Oxford as an undergraduate — said the the idea came to him while doing postgraduate work on a joint degree between Imperial College and the Royal College of Art on design and innovation.
He came into the degree with a lot of big ideas, inspired by companies like Airbnb. “There is just so much potential for design-led companies,” he said of his thinking at the time.
One of the remits that the course cohort was given, he said, was to think about the broader concept of aging and services to address that. As part of the course, he travelled to Japan — which has its own specific reverence for ageing and the death process — and based himself at an old people’s home in Tokyo for six months along with “a team of enthnographers and anthropologists.”
He came out of that with an insight he didn’t expect, he recalled. “I felt that at the end of my six months there, Id failed in my role as a designer,” he said. “All we focused was on the superficiality of ageing: how can we make better cutlery, or beds or seating that helped them move around? It was all about mobility and the physical aspects. But why we didnt get close to talking about was that most of these people were facing their mortality. And in care homes, you dont have friends or family around.” In other words, physical details and making life more manageable or enjoyable are fine, but Garrett didn’t feel that they got to the heart of the matter.
“To my mind, if youre a designer, your responsibility is to get to the bottom of whatever the issue is,” he said. His dissertation, about dementia care, raised questions not about cutlery per se but person-centered approaches. “So much of it is about physical amelioration, not psychological aspects.”
So when he returned to the UK, he set to work trying to understand “the death industry.” He spent two months doing what he described as “mystery shopping”, regularly visiting funeral directors, and saying he was coming to discuss a death (a hypothetical one, not a real one) to understand what process people went through when they walked through the door for a real funeral. “I made sure I didn’t waste too much of their time,” he said.
He then also got a qualification in will writing and started offering services to his friends (free) who needed help to go through the probate process — which involves sorting out death duties, organising personal effects and the estate and so on. He — and Farewill — have also tried to embody a transparent and ethical approach in the work throughout, which has also included making it easier to designate pledged legacy income in wills (that is donations to causes). The aim is to reach £1 billion in pledged legacy income by 2023, with over £200 million raised so far and the numbers accelerating.
All that hands-on experience was important, he said, to get to grips with what he wanted to build. “I may have three masters degrees, but I am terrible at learning without actually doing something,” he said.
One big conclusion Garrett found was that not only was the death industry large and complicated, not least because of the subject matter, but because it had no technical innovation at all around it.
“There is this profound human aversion to dealing with death, and that is a brilliant design challenge,” he said.
Indeed, like it or not, death is always around us, and perhaps particularly right now. In the US — itself home to a number of startups focusing on death-related services — will writing companies have seen huge spikes in their business in the last several months. And even with the economic slowdown much of the globe is now seeing as a result of COVID-19, death care services (which don’t include will writing but everything after death), is projected to be a $102 billion industry this year.
It’s numbers like that, and Farewill’s execution in what it is doing, that has attracted investors.
How about entirely removing the administrative pain for those grieving for their loved ones? How about providing an affordable, effortless and considerate service? Thats what the Farewill team is doing – with an extraordinary blend of compassion and tech-fueled efficiency, said Stan Laurent, Partner at Highland Europe in a statement. For too long, the wills and funeral industry has been largely geared towards profit over purpose. Since our first meeting with Dan, we knew that Farewill had the ingredients to radically disrupt the industry. Were excited to back them as they broaden their ambition.
“Farewill has made phenomenal progress since our initial investment 18 months ago,” added Tim Levene, CEO of Augmentum Fintech, in a statement. They have grown by 10x and launched a suite of successful new products. This additional capital will provide further opportunity for the company to innovate an archaic industry, and become the leading digital platform in death services.
(Farewill also recently won a Europa award for its contribution to social innovation.)"

“We’re focusing on the five countries that we’re already in,” says Liftit chief executive Brian York.
The company recently hired a head of operations for Mexico and a head of operations for Brazil as it looks to double down on its success in both regions.
Funding for the round was led by Cambridge Capital and included investments from the new Latin American focused firm H20 Capital along with AC Ventures, the venture arm of the 2nd largest coca-cola bottler in Latam; 10x Capital, Banyan Tree Ventures, Alpha4 Ventures, the lingerie brand Leonisa; and Mexico’s largest long haul trucking company, Grupo Transportes Monterrey. Individual investor, Jason Radisson the former chief operating officer of the on-demand ride hailing startup 99, also invested.
The new capital comes on top of Liftit’s $14.3 million Series A from some of the region’s top local investors. Firms like Monashees, Jaguar Ventures and NXTP Ventures all joined the International Finance Corp. in financing the company previously and all returned to back the company again with its new funding.
Investors likely responded to the company’s strong performance in its core markets. Already profitable in Chile and Colombia, Liftit expects to reach profitability across all of its operations before the end of the year. That’s despite the global pandemic.
Of the 220 contracts the company had with shippers half of them went to zero and the other half spiked significantly, York said. While Liftit’s major Colombian customer stumbled, new business, like Walmart, saw huge spikes in deliveries and usage.
“Managing truck drivers is incredibly difficult, and trucking, in our opinion, is not on demand,” said York. “At the end of the day the trucking market in all of Latin America is a majority of independent owners. Theyre not looking for on-demand work theyre looking for full time work.”
 Less than one percent of the company’s deliveries come from on-demand orders, instead, it’s a service comprised of scheduled shipments with optimized routes and efficiencies that are bringing customers to Liftit’s virtual door. 
“We do scheduled trucking delivery so we integrate with existing systems that shippers have and start planning how many trucks theyre going to need and the routes theyre going to take and tee it up exactly what is going to happen regardless what the traffic conditions are so we have been able to reduce the delivery times for the trucks,” said York."

The delivery robot made its debut in New York City last year, only to get the boot from Mayor Bill de Blasio. These days, however, the prospect of increased automation seems all the more pressing, as COVID-19 has left many reconsidering the human element of the supply chain. 
The logistics giant reached out to TechCrunch this week to note that it has been using robots in another matter for a few months now. In May, FedEx installed a quartet of robotic arms from Yaskawa America and Plus One, with the express intent of helping sort the massive numbers of parcels that pass through its Memphis facility. 
For reasons that should be clear to anyone who follows the category, human workers still play a key role in the process. The company says several members of its Small Package Sort System team who previously did the sorting themselves are operating as supervisors for the new robotic employees.
FedEx says it was actively exploring these technologies prior to COVID-10. While COVID has not directly played a role in accelerating the tech adoption, the company tells TechCrunch, it has exponentially increased the amount of e-commerce packages traveling through the Memphis hub, so COVID has validated the need for this technology and its support for our team members working at the Memphis hub.
The industry has, after all, been moving in this direction for some time. Amazon, which has made massive investments in and acquisitions of several robotics firms, is probably the best existing model for how humans and robotics can work side by side to process massive volumes of parcels. UPS, too, has looked increasingly toward automation. Last year it announced a goal of processing 80% of packages through automated facilities. With a massive ongoing health crisis like COVID-19 posing a risk to workers and customers alike, additional automation seems like a no-brainer for many such outfits. 
To date, FedEx says it has not made any investment in robotics companies."

To enforce social distancing and slow the spread of the COVID-19 health pandemic, many of us have decamped from our offices to our homes, we only connect with colleagues and others virtually, and it’s all too easy to lose sight of our focus and strategy in the midst of it all.
But in the grand tradition of enterprise IT, that creates an opportunity, and today, a startup called Lattice, whose platform helps track, reward and set goal achievement in the workplace, has closed a round of $45 million to help address some of those issues.
The funding, a Series D, is being led by Tiger Global with participation from Frontline Ventures, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital Partners, Fuel Capital, and Y Combinator. It values the company at around $400 million, CEO and co-founder Jack Altman (whose brother Sam used to run Y Combinator and is now at OpenAI…) said in an interview. It doubles Lattice’s valuation since October 2019, when the startup closed a Series C of $25 million, also led by Tiger Global.
The healthy bump in valuation is a sign of the times: while the novel coronavirus spread has led to a lot of strain on certain sectors of the world of tech (and more generally certain industries like travel), others have found themselves seeing big surges of demand. Lattice has bumped up its own customers numbers to 1,900 businesses, from 1,400 in October (with their size in the 50-1,500 range generally) and Altman says that Lattice’s employee count, which now numbers around 200, has grown at the same rate.
The reason for the good growth? Lattice, along with companies like it, have taken on a key role — that of providing structure in an organisation — at a time when we have lost a lot of that.
“In March and April our customers were transferring to remote and business slowed down, a lot,” he said. “Now, it’s picked up.”
Indeed, “workplace” has taken on a very different meaning for many of us in these COVID-19 days, but some might argue that as the workplace concept stretches and is tested, it’s more important than ever for individuals to have a sense of how they are doing within it.
Lattice’s product covers a spectrum of tools that both tap into the idea of proactive usage, and more passive data flow, both to help build up a picture of how employees are doing, and also to help provide better communication of goals achieved between those employees and their managers.
It includes software to give and get feedback and run reviews, set goals for employees, deliver praise, and get updates on what people are working on. It also features integrations with other platforms like Slack that help communicate “wins” but also track these milestones so that they can feed into an analytics engine to help facilitate the process of taking stock during review time, both for employees themselves as well as their managers.
All of these are great, but even so probably still only scratch the tip of the iceberg in terms of how productivity can be better managed longer term using new innovations such as artificial intelligence.
Altman (Jack, not Sam) says that he believes we are at least five years away from realistically building AI platforms that can seamlessly track all our work activity, both within our work apps and in a wider network of digital activity — to provide us with real time updates on how we are doing, what we’re doing well but also how we could be doing better.
That’s before considering whether we are ready to accept that kind of concept as helpful and not dystopian. Lattice, he added, is definitely interested in that long-term goal even as it continues to build products that can address performance management as it’s known and identified as a business area today.
The challenges of today, in any case, are no less massive and already a big shift, considering the move many of us have made to new work environments, which for some will take a long time to return to “normal” or at least start to feel “normal” and routine again.
That’s the bigger opportunity for companies like Lattice, which compete not only against other pure-play platforms like BetterWorks or 15Five, but also those that integrate performance management into wider human resources platforms like Workday. While the two may co-exist for a long time, it means that for a company like Lattice, it has both opportunities to continue and grow as a standalone service, as well as one that might potentially get snapped up in that wider consolidation trend.
“In the migration to a more remote world, the tools for organizations to help manage, engage, and develop their teams are more important than ever, said Miles Grimshaw, Partner at Thrive Capital, in a statement. Were excited to further advance the impact of Lattices employee success platform.”"

In the first half of the year, consumers spent $50.1 billion worldwide across the App Store and Google Play — a figure that’s up 23.4% from the first half of 2019. Previously, revenue had grown 20% between the first half of 2018 and 2019, for comparison. In addition, first-time app installs were up 26.1% year-over-year in the first half of 2020 to reach 71.5 billion downloads.
Apple’s App Store accounted for 18.3 billion of those downloads, up 22.8% year-over-year, while Google Play delivered 53.2 billion new app installs, up 27.3%.

Though Google Play saw far more app installs, Apple’s App Store continued to outpace its rival on consumer spending.
During the first half of the year, the App Store generated $32.8 billion from in-app purchases, subscriptions, and premium apps and games, Sensor Tower estimates. This figure is up 24.7% year-over-year from the $26.3 billion spent during the first half of 2019. It’s also nearly twice the estimated gross revenue on Google Play, which was $17.3 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year.

The pandemic’s impacts are only somewhat reflected in the top-earning (non-game) apps of the first half of 2020. The biggest earner, for example, was Match’s online dating app Tinder — an app that, one would think, would have dropped out of the top 5 due to social distancing requirements.
During the first half of the year, Tinder generated an estimated $433 million in spending across both app stores, combined. However, this number does represent a decrease of about 19% from the first half of 2019, or $532 million. It’s unclear how much that decline is related to consumers’ changing behavior and spending habits during the pandemic. Though shelter-in-place orders and quarantines kept people indoors and social distancing, social networking apps — and particularly those focused on online communication — have boomed amid lockdowns.

Tinder embraced the growing interest in online networking by making its “Passport” feature free. This setting allows users to match with other singles around the world, turning Tinder into more of a social app than one focused on real-world dating. But this change could have also led to a decrease in Tinder’s total revenues for the first half of the year.
The No. 2 top grossing app during the first half of 2020 was YouTube, bringing in an estimated $431 million globally. This was followed by ByteDance’s TikTok with $421 million. The social video app, which includes Douyin in China, had also broken download records during the first half of the year, passing 2 billion total global downloads, Sensor Tower earlier reported.
Tencent Video and Netflix were the No. 4 and No. 5 top grossing apps, respectively.
Meanwhile, consumers stuck at home during the pandemic have been downloading apps and games in greater numbers. During the first half of the year, consumers installed 71.5 billion apps for the first time, up 26.1% from the first half of 2019.

TikTok was the most-downloaded app in the first half of the year with 626 million downloads. But its position may look quite different in the second half of year, given the recent changes in India where the government has now banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok.
The No. 2 and No. 3 apps were WhatsApp and Zoom, respectively — the latter an indication of the rapid shift to work-from-home and consumers’ embrace of online video conferencing, in general. In addition to WhatsApp, Facebook snagged the No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 positions in the top 10, with Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, in that order.
Snapchat’s social app was No. 7 and No. 8 was video app Likee, which is similar to TikTok but offers a variety of face effects and filters. Netflix and YouTube rounded out the top 10.
Mobile gaming also saw a boost during the pandemic, with game spending up 21.2% year-over-year to reach an estimated $36.6 billion during the first half of the year, Sensor Tower found. Spending on the App Store grew 22.7% year-over-year to reach $22.2 billion, while Google Play game spending grew 19% to reach $14.4 billion.

Tencents PUBG Mobile beat out Honor of Kings as the top-grossing game for the first half of the year. Tencent’s game, which includes its localized versions (Game for Peace and Peacekeeper Elite) generated $1.3 billion across both app stores, not including China’s third-party Android app stores. Honor of Kings, meanwhile, pulled in roughly $1 billion.
The remaining top 10 included, in order, Monster Strike ($632M), Roblox, Coin Master, Candy Crush Saga, AFK Arena, Gardenscapes, Fate/Grand Order, and Pokémon Go. The latter recently adapted to indoor gaming amid government lockdowns.
Roblox, in particular, has been surging due to the pandemic as kids stuck indoors have gone online to play and socialize with friends in its virtual environment. In June, Sensor Tower reported Roblox had surpassed a milestone of $1.5 billion in lifetime player spending, for instance. Coin Master, meanwhile, is approaching the $1 billion lifetime player milestone, the firm found.
In terms of top game installs, PUBG Mobile came out on top here as well, followed by another battle royale title, Garena Free Fire. Ruby Game Studios Hunter Assassin, Eyewind Limiteds Brain Out, and Playrixs Gardenscapes — which many found to be a relaxing distraction during a stressful time — rounded out the top five.

Across all of the mobile gaming market, downloads grew 42.5% year-over-year to reach 28.5 billion first-time installs in the first half of 2020. Of those, Google Play downloads grew 46.2% year-over-year to 22.8 billion while App Store downloads grew 29.5% to 5.7 billion.

COVID-19 impacts more apparent in Q2 
Indications of COVID-19’s impact on the app market can be found among the figures for the first half of the year — like the growth seen by Zoom or social gaming platforms like Roblox, for example. But a closer look at the second quarter of 2020 alone makes the COVID-19 impacts more apparent.
Sensor Tower’s initial projections show consumer spending on apps and games jumped 11% on a quarterly basis from Q1 to Q2, and grew 28.8% year-over-year to reach $26.4 billion worldwide. This is a sizable increase from the 1.4% growth between Q1 2019 and Q2 2019. Downloads were up 12% on a quarterly basis and up 31.7% year-over-year to reach 37.8 billion worldwide. Again, a large increase from the 2.5% growth between Q1 2019 and Q2 2020."

Today, Shenzhen-based Pudu Robotics announced that it has completed a $15 million Series B, with Beijing food services group, Meituan as the sole investor. 
Pudu describes itself as a smart delivery robotics company, with a majority of its products falling within the food services category. There are multiple robotic SKUs for food delivery and dish return, all of which are indoor models. Rather than focusing on delivery apps, the robotics are designed for a variety of scenarios under the same roof, including hotels, restaurants and office buildings. 
Last month, Pudu noted that it has deployed hundreds of units to hospitals in South Korea and its native China amid the pandemic. Other existing clients include restaurants and hotels, all of which are looking for methods for reducing human contact as a means of transmitting the novel coronavirus. In total, it says its robots have been deployed in 200 cities across 20 countries. 
Non-human physical contact means safety, and automation means saving human efforts. In the event of human life, these two advantages will be magnified, CEO Zang Tao said in a press release issued last month. “Many technology companies have played an important role in intelligent disinfection, unmanned delivery and intelligent diagnosis during COVID-19, which made an irreversible influence to the public health system.
The irreversible bit remains to be seen, of course. What does seems certain, however, is that COVID-19 will be in important testing ground for the efficacy and need for these sorts of technologies. What seemed like, at best, an indulgence a year ago is now being viewed as a potentially necessary part of the food handling process. The virus has certainly driven investor interest, but it will be up to the startups to show theyre really to deliver on the promise."

The challenge was released on March 16. Within five days it had already garnered more than 500,000 views and been downloaded more than 18,000 times.
Early in the outbreak in China, Alibaba released that AI algorithm trained on more than 5,000 confirmed coronavirus cases. Using CT scans, it can diagnose patients in 20 to 30 seconds. It can also analyze the scans of diagnosed patients and quickly assess health declines or progress, based on signs like white mass in the lungs. Alibaba opened its cloud-based AI platform to medical professionals around the world, working with local partners on anonymous data for deployment, including modules for epidemic prediction, CT Image analytics, and genome sequencing for coronavirus.
With the amount of medical data in the world now estimated to double every couple of months or so, health care was ripe for AIeven before the virus struck. A 2019 study covering 19 countries artificial intelligence health care markets estimated a 41.7 percent compound annual growth rate, from $1.3 billion in 2018 to $13 billion in 2025, in six major growth areas: hospital workflow, wearables, medical imaging and diagnosis, therapy planning, virtual assistants, and, lastly but most significantly, drug discovery. Covid-19 will accelerate those trends rapidly.
Deep learningthe capability to process massive, multi-model data at high speedspresents one of the most far reaching opportunities for AI. Deep neural networks, a subtype of AI, have already been used to produce accurate and rapid algorithmic interpretation of medical scans, pathology slides, eye exams, and colonoscopies. I see a clear roadmap of how AI, accelerated by the pandemic, will be infused into health care.
The potential goes beyond diagnosis and treatment. Getting appointments, paying insurance bills, and other processes should be much less painful. AI combined with robotic process automation can analyze workflows and optimize processes to deliver significantly more efficient medical systems, improve hospital procedures, and streamline insurance fulfillment. To address the pandemic, AI could automate and accelerate pre-diagnostic inputs by crunching texts, languages, and numbers at machine-level quantity and precision. 
With sufficient data as a foundation, AI can also establish health data benchmarks for individuals and for populations. From there, its possible to detect variations from the baseline. That, in turn, positions us to identify potential pandemics early. Its not easy. Systems need to be connected so that early alert and response mechanisms can be truly effective. That appeared to be a shortcoming in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.
There are already huge opportunities for using AI models and algorithms for new drug discovery and medical breakthroughs in genomic sequencing, stem cells, Crispr, and more. In todays pharmaceutical world, there is a hefty price tag to developing a treatment. A huge part of this cost is eaten up by the money and time spent on unsuccessful trials. But with AI, scientists can use machine learning to model thousands of variables and how their compounded effect may influence the responses of human cells.
These technologies are already being used in the hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine and other therapies. Insilico Medicine, a Hong Kongbased AI company specializing in drug discovery, was among the first companies to react to Covid-19. The company used its generative chemistry AI platform to design new molecules to target the main viral protein responsible for replication. It published the molecules on February 5. AI and machine learning are ushering in an era of faster and cheaper cures for mankind. Drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole will be revolutionized.
Early one winter morning in the year 2035, I wake up and notice a bit of a sore throat. I get up and walk to the bathroom. While I brush my teeth, an infrared sensor in the bathroom mirror takes my temperature. A minute after I finish brushing my teeth, I receive an alert from my personal AI physician assistant showing some abnormal measurements from my saliva sample and that I am also running a low fever. The AI PA further suggests that I take a fingertip needle touch blood test. While the coffee is brewing, the PA returns with the analysis that I might be coming down with the flu, one of the two types around this season. My PA suggests two video call time slots with my family doctor, should I feel the need to consult her. She will have all the details of my symptoms when I make the call. She prescribes a decongestant and paracetamol, which is delivered to my door by drone."

Some, like the Bay Area's Caltrain system, face an existential crisis.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-pushing-mass-transit-systems-brink/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f15fcf8a02c85d717bb307d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/business_caltrain_20090659789266.jpg",2020-07-21T11:00:00Z,"On March 1, the Bay Areas Caltrain rail system was in the midst of a $2 billion plan to electrify its tracks, replace its aging diesel locomotives, and run more trains between San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Now, officials warn that without serious funding helpabout $100 million annuallyCaltrain could shut down altogether.
There are plenty of reasons why Caltrain is sui generis. Many stem from the strangesome might say pervertedgovernance structure of Bay Area transit. Caltrain is managed by a board representing the three counties through which the rail line travels, and a ballot measure to request new funding needs to be approved by the boards of supervisors of each county, plus four separate transit boards. Last week, San Francisco supervisors declined to place a -cent sales tax on the ballot in November, a measure that would keep the rail linewhich has lost 95 percent of its riders since pandemic shutdowns began in the springafloat.
The causes of Caltrains woes are unusual, but its predicament may be a harbinger for other transit systems in the Covid-19 era. Transit is being stretched to the brink everywhere, says Steven Higashide, director of research at the research and advocacy organization TransitCenter. Its not just in the Bay Area that agencies are facing these existential questions of how to triage service.
Public transit faces a near-perfect storm. Ridershipand fare revenuehave dropped dramatically, as many people work from home and others avoid mass anything. Each transit system is different, but even before the pandemic, fares generally covered only 20 to 25 percent of system operating costs. The rest comes from taxes. But tax receipts are falling at all levels of government amid the coronavirus-induced economic downturn. Meanwhile, agencies are shelling out more in cleaning costs, to protect riders and workers. And no one knows when Americans who have a choice will get back on the bus.
The federal pandemic relief bill passed in April gave agencies a lifeline, in the form of $25 billion. But that money wont last forever. A TransitCenter analysis finds that the money allocated to the countrys 10 biggest systems will last between five and eight months; some smaller systems could survive up to two years. New Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which alone carries 38 percent of the countrys transit passengers, projects a funding shortfall of $3.9 billion for 2020. Los Angeles Metro says it will lose $1.8 billion by 2022. Clevelands RTA says its facing a 14 percent budget reduction. San Franciscos Municipal Transportation Agency, which provided more than 10 percent of Caltrains $155 million budget this year, says it may have to cut the majority of its own bus lines. We are experiencing the greatest national disaster since World War II, says Jarrett Walker, a transportation consultant who has done work in the Bay Area. We should expect everything to be unprecedented.
Transit is being stretched to the brink everywhere.
Steven Higashide, director of research, TransitCenter
The debate over the future of Caltrain also raises larger questions about the purpose of public transportationand who the system should work for. Almost a quarter of the systems riders live in households with incomes topping $200,000 a year, and like other systems that rely on office workersMetroNorth and LIRR in New York, MetroLink in LAits ridership is suffering. Ridership has fallen less on systems where passengers are more likely to be middle-class or essential workers.
That has led critics to ask: Do systems like Caltrain deserve a bailout? Why should sales taxesregressive taxes that proportionally impact poor people more than their wealthier neighborshelp those systems survive? Does transit need a new way to pay for itself? Transportation is a means to an end, says Beth Osborne, who directs the transportation policy and advocacy organization Transportation for America. If transit is suffering right now, its because theres a much bigger problem we need to solve. Critics of a Caltrain bailout hope that if the systems purse-holders reach a compromise, it will help people who find it hard to afford to ride. (Caltrain is considering a suite of policies to do just that.)
A new federal coronavirus relief bill could help bail out transit. (One languishing in the House of Representatives would provide nearly $16 billion.) And local taxes, to help regional systems, could end up on ballots in November. Caltrain board members could reach a compromise that allows them to do that this week. Ultimately, voters are going to come to the rescue, says Walker, the transit consultant. Or not."

The Amazon exec laid out the companys plans for addressing the pandemic on a number of different levels, including building a testing lab for employees, along with regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms.
It has become a given that Amazon would test employees exhibiting fever and other COVID-19 symptoms. The company is, after all, one of the primary retail backbones for the U.S. and a number of other countries. And while the World Health Organization has stated that it doesnt believe the virus can be transmitted via parcels, the virus has the potential to spread extremely quickly within a warehouse. 
The notion of testing employees who dont exhibit symptoms has been a less pressing question, however, due in no small part to the limited availability of testing kits. But as the WHO, CDC and other organizations have made abundantly clear, its entirely possible to carry the virus while remaining asymptomatic a fact thats made the novel coronavirus all the more scary. 
Once testing becomes more readily available, it will be important to determine whether employers can, in fact, mandate testing, regardless of whether employees exhibit symptoms. There are important matters of both public safety and personal sovereignty to take into account. 
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been actively updating guidance for employers under the Americans with Disabilities Act:
The EEO laws, including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, continue to apply during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following the guidelines and suggestions made by the CDC or state/local public health authorities about steps employers should take regarding COVID-19. Employers should remember that guidance from public health authorities is likely to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Therefore, employers should continue to follow the most current information on maintaining workplace safety. 
Among the updated issues to deal with the pandemic is screening, which includes a temperature check. During a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus, the EEOC continues. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.
We put the question to Tricia Bozyk Sherno, counsel at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, who focuses on employment and general commercial litigation. 
For current employees, a medical inquiry or exam is permitted for current employees only if the employer has a reasonable belief that a particular employee will provide a direct threat due to a medical condition, Sherno explains. For new employees, the ADA permits employers to conduct medical examinations after a conditional offer of employment is made, but before an individual begins working, provided that all employees in the same job category must be subject to the same examination requirement. The primary medical examination considered by the existing EEOC guidance is temperature measurements. Available guidance does not yet address COVID-19 testing.
The current rules around testing arent entirely clear under current guidelines, but expect that to continue to evolve as testing becomes more widely available and state governments begin to loosen stay-at-home restrictions. We can likely expect that the guidance will no longer apply once the pandemic is no longer deemed a threat. What remains consistent under ADA guidelines, however, is the illegality of firing an individual over a condition like COVID-19. 
The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with a disability and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for such individuals, says Sherno. Local and state laws may also provide additional protections for impacted employees."

Verzuz, a song-battle series started by producers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, is one of the driving engines behind appointment viewing under lockdown. Already, T-Pain has squared off against Lil Jon. Nelly and Ludacris have traded regional pop hits. In the days leading up to the Jill Scott-Erykah Badu bout, Black Twitter morphed into a smorgasboard of memes. When R&amp;B legends Teddy Riley and Babyface finally came to a head (after a string of technical difficulties cut the first match short), the meeting carried Super-Bowl-level significance, exceeding half a million viewersincluding former First Lady Michelle Obama.
Verzuz is not TV in the traditional sensethe weekly stream is essentially a competition between two musicians (producers, songwriters, or rappers) to decide who has the superior discographybut it does incorporate all the hallmarks of great TV: the mind-tingling minutiae found in a music docu-series, the comforting goodwill of family sitcoms, deliciously homebaked reality show drama (the latter is always supplied in the comments section from other celebrities). On average, Verzuz streams pull in anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 viewersan enormous number considering people could be doing literally anything else with all their free timeand the hype around the series has been nothing short of volcanic.
The weekly music competition is just one way television is being reassembled under quarantine. Culturally, what the pandemic has made clear is that some of the best TV is not on TV anymore. Depending on your internet diet, thats been the case for a while nowInsecure and High Maintenance were darling web series long before they were given prestige treatment on HBO. Today, we live in and across screens; theyre our chief form of communication, our main points of access. Theyre the gateway into and out of the world. Our appetites for entertainment have rapidly changed; TV naturally adapts in response. The limits of quarantine have made this change especially palpable, especially exciting.
These very circumstances have resulted in a small entertainment renaissance. What is happening in this moment is a re-engineering of our expectations around TV: How we define it, what it looks like, where we experience it and for how long, what its ultimately capable of. The next phase of TV wont be steered by one company or ethossorry, Netflixbut it will reflect a patchwork of what we are witnessing in small brilliant bursts across video-centric social platforms: the hypnotic efficiency of TikTok, the impulsive, DIY nature of Instagram Live and Snapchat. With nothing to do and nowhere to go, everyone is turning the camera on themselves. The TV set is broken. These are the new primetime channels.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Understanding this shift requires that you toss out whatever grizzled understanding you have of TV and how TV shows are made. Studio-backed programs arent going anywhereIm not sure Id survive without Atlanta, Barry, Queen Sugar, and Los Espookysbut its important that we make room for TV that is more structurally-loose and nonconformist. TV that you wouldnt think of as TV.
Since early April, Ive spent the bulk of my non-working time one of two ways: on TikTok or secretly thumbing through Instagram (I swore to never get back on the app but I have to find utopia wherever I can these days). Some mornings begin with a shot of self-help programming, of which Tabitha Brown has become an indispensable balm. With a following north of 3 million, her TikTok videos meld the best of the genre: uplift, realness, and honey-dipped hard truths. A clip about fresh pressed juice becomes a moment of needed encouragement. Tell yourself, Today Im being good to myself, Brown says in the video before taking another sip. I dont care what the day brings. Watching seven or eight videos in succession is not that different from the self-improvement TV Netflix markets to global audiences with Queer Eye and Tidying Up withMarie Kondo. Even as the formats are disparatehighly-produced half-hour segments versus an off-the-cuff moment before or after a mealthe results are strikingly similar. Suddenly the day feels a little less impossible to take on."

But today that is increasingly rare. What has risen in its place is something known as programmatic advertising. With programmatic, ads no longer target specific publications. Instead, they target specific types of users, based on things like age, sex, locationalong with the creepier stuff, like what their browsing history reveals about their interests. Advertisers now put their ads into an automated system with instructions to reach a certain audience, wherever they are. They have some power to tell the system to keep their ads away from certain sites and content, but the results are spotty.
Programmatic advertising is the economic fuel of the free internet. Its rise has made it dramatically easier for anyone to create their own site and immediately make money from traffic. Unfortunately, the same convenience that allows a food blogger to turn their following into an income also allows anyone to set up a site pushing hate speech or propaganda and get it monetized without any advertiser explicitly choosing to pay them.
Facebook. Instagram. YouTube. Amazon. How much do you trust these products? Take our survey and tell us what you think.
Previously, without ad tech, it was much harder for them to make money, says Augustine Fou, an ad fraud consultant. Automation changed everything. The key change, Fou explains, was the ease with which you can copy and paste a few lines of code onto your site and start running ads and making money. Prior to programmatic, youd have to get an advertiser or a media buying agency to give you money. Ad-tech tools do allow brands to block certain sites and types of content, but advertisers frequently dont take advantage of them.
The paradox of programmatic advertising is that while it might be easy to tap into, the actual mechanism is absurdly complex: a series of real-time auctions mediated by layers of automated middlemen. Every time a page or app running programmatic ads is loaded, the publisher starts by sending its available ad space, along with whatever information it has on the user loading the pageessentially the inventory its sellinginto its ad server. (The most popular ad server by far is run by Google.) The ad server beams out a bid request to advertisers looking to target that type of user. Brands put their ads into an ad-buying platform, along with their target audience and what theyre willing to pay. (Google also owns the biggest buying-side platform, which is particularly popular among smaller businesses.) The platform sends that bid to the ad exchange, where it competes against other bids for the target audience. The winning bid then competes against all the winners from all the other exchanges. Finally, the winner of winners appears on the publishers site. Believe it or not, this is a dramatically oversimplified account; the real thing is much more complicated. But, in a nutshell, thats how a household name like Merck or Dell can end up sponsoring Covid denialism. (Two weeks ago, Google finally announced that it would begin blocking ads from running on stories promoting debunked coronavirus theories.)
Technically, most social media advertising could also be described as programmatic display, in the sense that its targeted at users based on behavioral data through an automated auction. The difference is that social media ads appear in the closed system of a given platform, while what Im calling programmatic advertising follows you all around the web. But the two share important similarities.
So much of it is about creating a space in which users can be targeted when they are, for lack of a better term, vulnerable, says the Posts Zucker-Scharff. Theyre vulnerable to the right piece of fake news showing up at the right part of a feed or on a site at the right time. That sort of thing only happens because they can be targeted with this type of data.
The last big bucket of digital ads is search: Results that advertisers pay to have displayed above or below the actual results from a search engine. This is a much simpler system. You pick your search engine, specify which search terms you want to trigger your ad, and pay based on how many clicks the ad gets. Theres no complicated chain of intermediaries that makes other ad ecosystems so ripe for foul play. And Google, which accounts for some 90 percent of the global search engine market, has pretty robust policies concerning the ads that run on its platform."

It's available in rural areas, but patients needed to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Now, patients will be able to access telehealth at home and from anywhere in the country.
Patients and clinicians will need a two-way visual and voice connection, and standard copays and deductibles will apply. Though, healthcare providers may be able to waive or reduce cost-sharing for telehealth.
The risk of serious illness from the coronavirus is much higher for older people and those with underlying health conditions, so keeping those populations at home while still providing healthcare makes sense. Now, older patients with diabetes, for instance, won't have to postpone routine visits, and if a patient is concerned they may have the coronavirus disease, they can consult with their doctor via telehealth.
This policy change is made possible by a waiver of Medicare rules authorized by Congress, as well as emergency declarations made by the Trump administration. The expanded telehealth coverage will remain in effect during the outbreak, but this could be an important step toward making remote healthcare more widely available in the future."

Different: They log heroic hours in the ICU, putting their own health and wellbeing at risk, to save as many lives as they can. Similar: Some of them pay too much attention to Twitter. 
Those two facts go a long way towards explaining the mission of the authors of the Fast Literature Assessment Review (FLARE) newsletter at Massachusetts General Hospital. When theyre not treating Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit, the eight doctors on the FLARE team work a second job: updating fellow physicians on the latest novel coronavirus research and debunking the freshest unproven theories floating around on social media. The free email list is still small, but growing fast: it grew from just under a thousand to nearly 2,000 subscribers over the past week.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
It started informally, in early March. A team of doctors at the hospital, led by pulmonologist Charles Corey Hardin, wanted to develop internal guidelines for Covid-19 treatment. Realizing that the state of knowledge was changing by the day, they decided to take turns summarizing the most up-to-date information in a daily email.
A few of us who are interested in some combination of basic science and medical education had been sending, as we often do, informal emails to our colleagues about papers wed read, recalls Raghu Chivukula, a pulmonary critical care doctor and biochemist whos part of the newsletter team. Things were evolving very fast, and there was no centralized place of knowledge that we could all trust. Over the course of a week or so, those informal emails developed into the FLARE newsletter. In one of them, they debunked the idea that Covid-19 is similar to altitude sickness. In another, Chivukula poured cold water on the hype around hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that some peoplemost notably Donald Trumphad begun breathlessly touting as an effective treatment for Covid-19. Corey, myself, and some of the others that self-organized into this group, do have a little bent of myth-busting about us, and I think all of us wanted to push back on this over-exuberant, not really data-driven, enthusiasm, Chivukula says. An expert on the biochemistry underlying chloroquine, he was well positioned to explain both why the drug could theoretically work to treat Covid-19, and why there was still insufficient real-world evidence to support using it.
Heres where Id normally quote from Chivukulas piece. But it wouldnt be much use unless you can parse sentences like: In the ensuing years, basic virology studies established that SARS-Cov depends on endosomal escape, that it buds from the Golgi apparatus, and that its receptor (ACE2) is itself glycosylated in the Golgi. FLARE is very much by doctors, for doctors. For the trained specialists who know their way around pulmonary jargon, however, the newsletters are concise, to the point, and meticulously footnoted. They begin with The FLARE Four, an Axios-style list of key takeaways, in large font, for the TL;DR crowd. And while the layout is unlikely to win any design awards, theres just enough formatting to help a tired ICU doctors eyes navigate through the densely-packed material.
Signups spread quickly throughout Mass General, and then beyond. Delivered via MailChimp, it now reaches doctors as far away as South Africa and India. Baak Çoruh, the program director for the pulmonary and critical care fellowship at the University of Washington, says she reads every issue, and encourages her 19 fellows to do the same. Its a curated, easily digestible resource, and its based on scientific evidence, she says. Nearly all of them have been incredibly helpful because theyre really targeting common questions that come up in critical care. The archived emails are all freely available on Mass Generals website."

Between the cytokine storms, the neurological ailments, the swollen-up toes, its all rather confusing, frightening, and yes, decidedly weirdthough, as virology Twitter will happily remind you, all viruses are weird.
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
The latest twist concerns how Covid-19 affects kids. The earliest reports showed that while kids are just as likely as adults to catch the virus, their symptoms are generally milderexcept for infants and children with preexisting conditions. Now, starting in Europe and then in New York and other cities on the East Coast, reports have emerged of a mysterious ailment that trails in the wake of Covid-19 infections. Kids have been showing up in hospitals with nagging fevers, rashes, bloodshot eyes, and other signs of an immune system going haywire. Many of the cases have evoked a rare, but treatable, ailment called Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that affects young children. Other patients have had more severe symptoms, such as low blood pressure and abdominal pain, sometimes requiring intensive care. Those cases are being called by a different name: pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or PIMS.
The scale of those complications is still emerging. At last count, these immune conditions have been reported in more than 100 kids in the New York area, three of whom have died. France and the United Kingdom each reported a single death late this week. In The Lancet, Wednesday, researchers at hospitals in Northern Italy identified the strongest link yet between the syndrome and Covid-19 infection, reporting 10 cases of Kawasaki-like illness over a two-week period, a 30-fold increase over the norm, with most patients testing positive for a current or past SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Just as many states are debating whether to reopen schools and summer camps, the mounting reports have given a sense of a secondary pandemic unfolding, equally terrifying as the first. Earlier this week, testifying before Congress, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, suggested policy makers stay humble about what we dont know about Covid-19 and kids.
He didnt say to panic.
I think theres generalized fear and anxiety because we told people the good news is that this virus doesnt do anything to children. And now were saying, Actually, heres a new thing, says Jane Burns, director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego. While she calls it an ugly twist, she notes that the original mantra still holds true: Very few kids are getting severely sick from Covid-19. Its a very rare phenomenon, she says. And among those who develop this new condition, even in its more severe form, most are doing just fine with treatment. For most kids, she says, Covid-19 symptoms are still mildundetectable even. (Though that raises plenty of other questions about the role of kids in the viruss transmission.)
Still, Burns says the cluster of cases is unusualunprecedented, even, in her 30 years studying Kawasaki disease and other immune conditions in kids. Nobody saw this coming, she says. I mean, how could we? Luckily, she says, doctors appear well-equipped to handle itand might have a lot to learn about the mysteries of rare immune diseases thanks to this surge in cases.
Kawasaki disease, with its telltale nagging fever and bouts of inflammation, is easily spotted by doctors. But that wasnt always so. For a long time, doctors didnt bother to distinguish it from other mystery inflammatory conditions linked to the developing immune system, says Susan Kim, a pediatric rheumatologist at the University of California, San Francisco. But then, in the 1960s, a Japanese doctor named Tomisaku Kawasaki identified a startling pattern: In some cases, if the inflammation was left untreated, kids would develop aneurysms in arteries around the heart that could result in long-term cardiac damage. So he developed a range of symptom criteria associated with the heart condition, including fever and various forms of inflammation, for the disease that came to bear his name."

He works with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, which, like Tulane, is part of a network of primate research centers jointly supported by the NIH and university hosts around the country. The centers are now diverting most of their focus to coronavirus research.
As the pandemic became increasingly serious, OConnors team took the sequence of the receptor the virus uses to latch on to human cells, and compared that sequence across a variety of lab animals, including macaques and African green monkeys. They found both of these species and humans have identical sequences at the key place where the virus binds, a reason to believe SARS-CoV-2 might be able to infect nonhuman primates. But this didnt take into account restriction factors, specialized built-in immune responsesusually proteinswhich are released in cells to prevent the replication of different viruses. These can vary widely among species. You never know ahead of time what sort of restriction factors or other types of blocks might prevent a virus from infecting a particular type of animal, OConnor says.
By the time the virus samples arrived at Tulane, a study in China had shown rhesus macaques could be infected, but there was no guarantee the team would be able to replicate their results or successfully infect the African green monkeys. But it was important to try: Nonhuman primates in general are much more closely related to man than the other species, Bohm says. Their organ systems are much more similar to humans than other animal models, so they offer a lot of benefits that other animals don't. Testing treatments and vaccines in monkeys can say more about their safety and efficacy than tests in other animals might.
The Tulane National Primate Research Center encompasses 500 acres of land, about 40 miles north of Tulane University. Tulane houses over 5,000 monkeys and has a biosafety level three laboratory (the minimum required to study SARS-CoV-2). Their first coronavirus experiment tested two species of monkey, African greens and Rhesus macaques, and two routes of exposure: aerosol exposure (breathing the virus in from the air) and direct contact (the virus was swabbed in the animals eyes, noses, and tracheas). The researchers goal was to determine how the disease differed between the species. The results would inform their future coronavirus experiments and any trials of vaccines or treatments.
Within days after initial exposure, all the monkeys were shedding the virus from everywhere the scientists sampled: eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, and vagina. But none of the animals had noticeable symptoms. Then, suddenly, the day after an examination in which she had appeared normal, one of the African green monkeys from the direct contact group showed signs of very severe pneumonia. CT scans showed her right lung was full of fluid, and she was so severely ill she met the study's criteria for early euthanasia. Two weeks later, a second African green female, this time from the aerosol group, developed the exact same symptoms in the same abrupt manner. She was also euthanized early, and scans again revealed severe edema in her right lung.
I think this is a very important step, says Koen Van Rompay, an infectious disease scientist at the UC Davis National Primate Research Center. Primate researchers from the national centers congregate for weekly calls to discuss their work, and last week Bohm and his colleagues recently shared the news of the severe illness in the African green monkeys, along with some details about the pathology of these animals. We really have to understand the monkey model, Van Rompay says. What are the conditions to develop the best animal model? Which species, which route of inoculation?"

Google and Apple don't work together on much, but they're working together on this: a set of underlying protocols inside Android and iOS that are able to speak to each other, even while your phone is in your pocket.
The first fruits of these efforts are now live on Android phones and iPhoneshere's how to find these settings on your phone, and what they actually do.
Photograph: Apple
What Apple and Google have developed isn't an app in itselfrather it's an application programming interface (an API), plus some other fundamental technologies, that other apps can plug into. When you load up a website with a Google Maps widget on it, that is using a Google Maps API, and the Covid-19 tracking tools work in the same way.
In other words, Apple and Google have done the groundwork, making sure that health apps can talk to each other across Android and iOS and get access to the features they need. It's now up to countries (and states) to develop the apps that plug into these foundations and provide the actual front-end interface for users. (If indeed they decide tosome agencies are working on completely bespoke systems of their own.)
A crucial part of this underlying framework is access to Bluetooth signals. Bluetooth is perfect for low-energy wireless transmission that can run in the background of your phone, without draining the battery excessively. (It's used for wireless headphones, car stereos, and the like.)
In this case, your phone will be logging other phones it comes into contact with, assuming both your device and the others are running a Covid-19 tracking app that's been fully enabled (which is why public support is going to be so important). These logs don't include any identifying information about you; they use random numerical ID codes that change frequently and get trashed completely once they're older than 14 days (the incubation period for Covid-19).
Based on what we know so far, the apps will be able to log the length of time you've been in contact with each person (or rather each individual phone), and how far away you were, judging from the strength of the Bluetooth signals. Any contact that's less risky (such as briefly passing someone on the street) will be ignored.
Very few Covid-19 tracking apps are out in the wild yet, but the features that Apple and Google have worked on are now live. Besides the settings that you'll find in future tracking apps, you can enable or disable ""exposure notification"" logging at the operating system level as wellit's a completely opt-in system."

I have great faith in youth, he says, because they're always asking the questions that nobody else will look at. He adds, with a laugh, Lets face it, Im 77. I think my real creative days were back when I was in my thirties and twenties. And he agrees that its right to be skeptical of how innovative big companies can really be. They have their own R&amp;D outfits, he says. They have their bureaucrats, they have their decisionmakers and their policy makers. And they have people who strike out in predictable directions.
If a cobbled-together group of laypeople working on Covid-19 testing in their spare time does end up winning, they would be continuing a tradition that stretches back to John Harrison, who won the longitude prize centuries ago. Harrison was a carpenter, and government officials were loath to recognize his achievements. They were appalled that a tradesman solved the problem, and they tried hard to bilk him out of the money, Best says. But, eventually, he did receive it.
Anyone who cracks the problem of rapid Covid-19 testing will be lauded as a hero. And even participants who dont have much of a chance of winning the competition could still have a great deal to gain from it. Lots of people participate knowing that they are not going to win, Kay says. That doesnt matter because they can get free publicity, they can get free participation, access to resources, [they] can get participation in that community.
For a young person, the experience and connections could jumpstart a career in technology development. Kay points out that the community of autonomous vehicle researchers may be able to trace its origins back to the Darpa Grand Challenge, which required teams to build a robotic car that could drive up to 150 miles without human intervention. The outcome of the competition might be not necessarily a new technology, but probably the creation of a new community around the topic, he says.
And this community doesnt only include those who participate directly in the competition. At their core, says Kay, prize competitions are a big promotional effort. By introducing this contest, Xprize and OpenCovidScreen are attracting coverage and attention to the problem of rapid testing. (After all, this article wouldnt exist without it.) One of the projects primary goals, Huber says, is getting smart people around the world to have a crisp articulation of, what's the highest-leverage problem to solve?though of course this benefit depends on Xprize and OpenCovidScreen having accurately identified that highest-leverage problem. In fact, today Xprize announced another related challenge: the Covid-19 CT Scan Collaborative, which will award $1.8 million to teams that can devise methods for using computed tomography scans to fight Covid-19.
The competitions hosts get a benefit, too. When an organization launches a competition, they are positioning themselves as an innovator in some way, Kay says. Or, as Best puts it: When you give a prize, you're telling the world that you are somebody who is of a certain status who is able to judge what's better or worse in this particular sector. So, you get some prestige out of awarding the prize.
Hubers hope isnt necessarily that the winning team will solve the testing problem once and for allinstead, he thinks that the competition will do the greatest good if it fosters a diverse set of approaches. The need for testing is so great, he says, that one solution isnt nearly enough. But many teams pursuing a variety of ideas may perhaps, in aggregate, make a great deal of difference.
This strategy has a certain modesty that is unusual for prize competitions. And whether or not their victor is able to come up with a solution to the current testing bottleneck, Ansari believes that Xprize still has a role to play in fighting pandemics, through attacking the grand challenges of environmental degradation and poverty that the contest has historically addressed. We hope to solve those big, hairy, audacious problems, she says. And hopefully, that will eliminate pandemics altogether in future."

Its a question I dread, because a subtext typically lingers underneath, e.g., I hate the open office, All this talk about collaboration is an excuse to take away my office, and even, I hope you feel good about taking away my private office (for the record, I dont). In the COVID-19 era, the question remains but the expectations and predictions are shifting. Fortunately, Frank Lloyd Wright already designed the solution.
When asked about a post-COVID-19 workplace, I simply whip out my smartphone and show the offices Wright created for S.C. Johnsons headquarters, completed in 1939.
The interior of the Johnson Wax Headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, circa 1940. The building was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright and built between 1936 and 1939. Image Credits: FPG/Getty Images
It. Is. Perfect. Six feet of distancing? Check. Need wide circulation paths to prevent those now-precarious spontaneous collisions between employees? Check. Natural light? Check. Want some biophilia? Problem solved.
The above image is the largest expanse of the Johnson Wax building and features no internal walls. It was originally intended for the secretaries, while a mezzanine was reserved for management.
Unfortunately, I can only maintain the irony and half-earnest smile for so long while showing this image. The reality is that Wrights building would never be built today: its arduously inefficient (from a headcount versus space ratio) and would be unlikely to survive a modern-day budget review (referred to in the industry as value engineering). A budget-conscious value engineering analysis would quickly replace Wrights custom-built furniture with equally functional corporate furniture systems or a benching solution to maximize efficiency oh, and, yes, collaboration.
The reality is that the COVID-19 crisis is not asking us to predict the workplace of the future but rather to evaluate cost against the unknown.
The term New Normal is about managing a real estate portfolio and its enormous costs against new workforce patterns that may undermine the very existence of an office. When colleagues or clients (or family members) ask me What is the workplace of the future?, the subtext is now, Do we even need a workplace in the future?"

Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Director, Earth System Branch in WMO’s Infrastructure Department believes that the impact of losing those aerial observations will still be “relatively modest.” However, he explained in a recent press release, “as the decrease in availability of aircraft weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts.”
“The same is true if the decrease in surface-based weather observations continues, in particular if the COVID-19 outbreak starts to more widely impact the ability of observers to do their job in large parts of the developing world. WMO will continue to monitor the situation, and the organization is working with its Members to mitigate the impact as much as possible,” he continued.
More immediate is the problem with the system’s aircraft-based sensors; primarily that they’re no longer in the sky, collecting vital ambient temperature, wind speed and direction readings. Aircraft rely on the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program (AMDAR) to collect the necessary data using onboard sensors, process and transmit it to relay stations on the ground via radio or satellite link. 
“More than 3,500 commercial aircraft normally provide over 250 million observations per year,” a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson told Engadget. “Throughout the flight path… these aircraft provide pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction, and in some cases humidity.”
The COVID-19 crisis has severely curtailed the commercial air travel industry. According to FlightRadar24, commercial traffic declined by 4.1 percent year-over-year in February followed by a 21.6 percent YOY drop in March. We could potentially see an overall 8.9 percent reduction of global air traffic compared to last year, according to one Bloomberg analyst. 
“As of March 31, the daily output of meteorological data from U.S. commercial aircraft has decreased to approximately half of normal levels,” the NOAA rep continued. They were also quick to point out that “even though a decrease in this critical data will possibly negatively impact forecast model skill, it does not necessarily translate into a reduction in forecast accuracy since National Weather Service meteorologists use an entire suite of observations and guidance to produce an actual forecast.”
However, a 2017 study conducted by NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory suggests that including aircraft-based data reduces six-hour forecast errors in wind, humidity and temperature by up to 30 percent in the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model for North America. As such, ""we would expect some decrease in skill at least in some specific situations from the [current] decline in aircraft data volume,"" Stanley Benjamin, the study’s co-author, told Weather.
A separate study conducted at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) found that eliminating aircraft data from their models reduced the accuracy of Northern Hemisphere jet-stream level forecasts by 15 percent and 3 percent for surface pressure. What’s more, as of February, the National Weather Service reports that it is only incorporating around 65 percent of the aircraft-based observations into the GSF model that it normally does. 
""We are anticipating the substantial reduction in the availability of US AMDAR data to continue over the coming weeks, likely to generate some measure of impact on the output of our numerical weather prediction systems,"" Christopher Hill of the NOAA said in a March news release. That same release revealed that between March 3rd and March 23rd the number of aircraft reports over Europe received and used at the ECMWF dropped 35 percent with a 42 percent reduction, globally.
Thankfully, meteorologists won’t be flying completely blind with so many airlines effectively out of commission. The ECMWF began pulling wind data from the Aeolus satellite in January. As for the NOAA, “while the automated weather reports from commercial aircraft provide exceptionally valuable data for forecast models, we also collect billions of Earth observations from other sources that feed into our models, such as weather balloons, surface weather observation network, radar, satellites and buoys,” the spokesperson told Engadget. “Additionally, NOAA will soon be using COSMIC-2 GPS radio occultation satellite data to further increase observations throughout the depth of the tropical atmosphere.”"

They were waiting not for a train but for a coronavirus test, at a white tent staffed by workers from nearby UC San Francisco.
The tents were pitched outside the 24th Street BART station to address a pernicious pattern in the Covid-19 outbreak in the US. The burden of sickness and death is significantly worse in low income and minority neighborhoods like the Missionas is the quality of data related to the disease.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Inequalities in US health care are longstanding, and have been sharpened by Covid-19. Low-income and minority communities tend to have greater needs, but receive less care due to barriers such as childcare constraints, low-status work, and cost. Those factors have also hindered access to Covid-19 testing, making it harder to know the true impact on low-income communities. Compounding the problem, many public health programs are not collecting the data needed to show the pandemics impact on poor and minority people. We have an incredible bias on our awareness, and on any forecasting, says Samuel Scarpino, a professor and epidemiologist at Northeastern.
A recent report from the University of Minnesotas Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy warned that a lack of data on how Covid-19 is affecting minority groups is limiting the US response to the disease. More than half of Covid-19 cases reported to the federal government by states through the end of May did not include the patients race or ethnicity. Without this data, its hard to say where interventions could be most beneficial, says Angela Ulrich, a research fellow in epidemiology and community health who worked on the report.
Another study published last month found evidence that socioeconomic bias is ingrained into the primary federal surveillance program for flulike illness, ILINet. It has been drafted to help track Covid-19, which often includes flulike symptoms.
Scarpino and other researchers examined how well data gathered by the program for the DallasFort Worth area could predict flu-related hospitalizations for different neighborhoods during a five-year period running through 2012. For the highest income zip codes, the forecasts were good. For the lowest quartile the forecasts were wildly inaccurate, Scarpino says. I strongly suspect that it is the pattern everywhere.
San Franciscos Mission District, one of the citys lowest-income neighborhoods, is a local epicenter of Covid-19 that has also been a pioneer in revealing the skewed impact of the disease.
Early in the pandemic, Mission community leaders and staff at UCSF both noticed that many of the people sickened by the new virus were Hispanic, says Susana Rojas, executive director of local nonprofit Calle 24 Latino Cultural District. The two organizations launched a study called Unidos En Salud that offered free testing to everyone in a densely populated zone at the heart of the neighborhood, whether or not they were sick.
The results were stunning. Latinx people made up 40 percent of the nearly 4,000 people testedbut 95 percent of those who tested positive. Rojas says thats because Latinx residents are more likely to live in more crowded households, and to work away from home while others work from home. It was very disheartening to see that our most vulnerable population was the one being most affected, says Rojas. The results led Calle 24 and UCSF to team up again to offer testing at the 24th Street station this month, to try and reach more of the Missions essential workers as they traveled to and from work.
Rojas says the Trump administrations immigration policies have made it extra hard to help and gather data from low-income and minority communities. Many Mission residents have become more suspicious of officialdom, even health care institutions during a deadly pandemic, because they fear attracting the notice of authorities."

However, when we surveyed a number of New York-based venture capitalists, they seemed bullish about the city’s future as a startup and technology hub. As AF Ventures’ David Levinson put it, “New York simply has too much to offer, from its richly diverse population, cultural significance and vast collection of industries to lose its entrepreneurial spirit.”
Lest you think this is just reflexive NYC boosting, several of our respondents offered stats and historical analyses to back up their arguments. They also discussed industries that are likely to flourish and how the shift to remote work will affect local startups.
Here’s who we interviewed:
<ul><li>Eric Hippeau, managing partner, Lerer Hippeau</li><li>Chad Anderson, managing partner, Space Capital</li><li>Nihal Mehta, founding general partner, Eniac Ventures</li><li>David Levinson, vice president, AF Ventures (formerly AccelFoods)</li><li>Hans Morris, managing partner, Nyca Partners</li><li>Matt Turck, partner, FirstMark</li><li>Zach Aarons, co-founder and managing partner, MetaProp</li><li>Andrew Ive, general managing partner, Big Idea Ventures</li><li>Andrew Ackerman, managing director, urbantech, Dreamit Ventures</li></ul>Keep in mind that if you’re on the hunt for an investor, several of these VCs are industry specific, which they note in their answers.
How much is local investing a focus for you now?
We are NY-first investors and the most active VC firm in the city. Local investing has always been our priority, and it is more so now than ever before given the pandemics impact on New York. However, we make a large number of investments outside of New York, particularly if our extensive NY network can be useful to the company.
In the short term, how do you think local startups have been affected by the fact that New York is the epicenter of the pandemic?
Some categories are performing well during this period, and others have been hit hard. Companies have had to rethink roles, benefits, office space, communication and KPIs, which is easier for early-stage companies to some degree than larger organizations. Companies that entered this period strong will come out stronger and those who were struggling will feel the impact the most. This is true for New York and elsewhere.
What do you expect to happen to the startup climate in NYC longer term, particularly if the shift to remote work continues? Will it still be a startup hub?
New York is resilient and will come back stronger than ever, but it will take some time. The most innovative businesses are often started in a downturn. These periods shine a light on systematic gaps and key problems that fuel creative solutions and entrepreneurism.
Remote working is a trend that will continue to be integrated into every business as appropriate once offices begin to reopen. Businesses are looking to make up for losses theyve experienced, so well see many companies rethink their physical office space needs and rely even more heavily on digital resources for employees to work effectively. New York excels at software, so we expect to see innovation in remote working, learning and healthcare software continue to accelerate.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
Healthcare technology and telemedicine have done well as they have become a necessity. COVID-19 has also shed a light on where there are gaps in health care. We’ve seen our New York-based health care investments including K Health, Medly and Klara step up in a real way to address patient needs during this time be it telemedicine, on-demand prescription delivery or doctor-patient communication. We expect to see new innovations in healthtech emerge with New York as a hotspot.
On-demand fitness is another industry thats seeing a boost. There was a rising popularity for at-home, on-demand fitness services before the crisis, and COVID-19 has accelerated the industrys mass appeal. Mirror, one of our investments, is one example. Peloton is another thats clearly benefiting. And ClassPass has adapted as well. All are New York companies.
Remote working and learning software have been essential, and we should expect these businesses to continue to have strong performance as theyre more universally adopted. Companies of all sizes need software collaboration tools in place to support their changing workforce. Air, which is workplace collaboration software for creative teams and one of our more recent investments, is well-positioned to address that need. I expect to see new innovations emerge as New York figures out how to get back to work in the months to come."

In China particularly, the older generations often worry about buying perishable food without scrutinizing them in person.
Still, venture investors are bullish on the future of online grocery. One beneficiary is China’s Missfresh, which announced (in Chinese) Thursday a new funding round of $495 million led by a fund under state-backed China International Capital Corporation. Other backers were Tencent, Abu Dhabi Capital Group and Tiger Global.
By placing mini-warehouses closer to customers, the six-year-old startup is able to offer 30-minute delivery service to households in 16 cities.
Few players are able to compete in e-grocery, for the business requires early investment in large-scale cold chains and expensive user acquisition to make home deliveries profitable. Unsurprisingly, almost all forerunners in China’s online grocery are backed by or collaborate with an internet giant.
Missfresh is deeply integrated into Tencent’s WeChat messenger. Alibaba has its own in-house Freshhippo supermarket chain that comes with a delivery service. Restaurant delivery platform Meituan added grocery to its offering last year. Dingdong Maicai is a rare case without the backing of a major tech firm, seeking funds from venture capital institutions like Qiming Venture Partners and Gaorong Capital.
Some question how many new adaptors will stick to on-demand grocery shopping in post-lockdown life. Research suggests they may. China saw 11.6 million more daily active users of e-grocery in May compared to the same period a year before, according to research firm QuestMobile. Consumers may be hooked to the convenience, but those who see their corner stores shutter due to lost business during the lockdown don’t have a choice but to go digital."

The preview video is short, full of nonsense buzzwords, but still telling. Its clear GM identified two main competitors against the upcoming Hummer: The Ford Bronco and Tesla Cybertruck.
The Hummer EV was announced pre-COVID 19 during the Super Bowl. At the time, GM promised it would feature 1,000 HP from the electric powertrain. Since then, little has been released about the upcoming vehicle, though GM maintains its still on track for production in the fall of 2021.
The video released today sports a handful of expected features and capabilities. Interestingly enough, these features are on both sides of the motoring spectrum. If categorized, they fall into two groups: on-road thrills and off-roading adventure. The video paints a clear picture: GM is targeting the Hummer EV against the Tesla Cybertruck and the Ford Bronco both vehicles that are getting a lot of attention because of their capabilities and design.
For positioning against the Cybertruck, GM is touting the Hummer EVs power of 1,000 HP and 11,500 lb-ft of torque (though this number is derived in a different fashion than usual). Its also saying the massive truck can hit 60 mph in 3 seconds, which is in the same realm as the top sports cars. Lastly, the video teaser stated the Hummer EV has an Adrenaline Mode, which is easy to assume is similar to Teslas Ludicrous mode, along with improved self-driving capability.
For the Bronco, GM is showing the Hummer EVs off-roading features, including a so-called Open Air Infinity Roof and Modular Sky Panels, which is likely similar to the Broncos expansive removable roof. Even more telling is the Crab Mode mentioned in the video. Crab Mode is likely a high-torque rock crawling mode for when bouldering off-road. With the crazy amount of torque available, the Hummer EV will probably be able to crawl up impressive inclines.
Pricing and exact availability have yet to be announced, and the same can be said about the Tesla Cybertruck. And dont forget about the upcoming electric Ford F-150. Theres a war of the electric pickup coming, and Im here for it."

Now in this era of COVID-19, these operators are being squeezed as travel and tourism has dwindled and companies have opted to have employees work from home.
One Los Angeles-based transportation booking startup called Swoop aims to bring these small, local operators into the digital age with a new software-as-a-service platform that it says is helping them adapt in this COVID-19 era. The startup, loaded with an injection of capital, is ramping up its SaaS product in hopes of tapping into a marketplace where customers spent $40 billion annually.
Swoop has raised $3.2 million in a seed funding round led by Signia Venture Partners, South Park Commons and several angel investors, including former Uber CPO Manik Gupta, Kevin Weil, co-creator of Libra at Facebook, Kim Fennel, a former Uber executive and Elizabeth Weil, former partner at Andreessen Horowitz, 137 Ventures.
“I’m fascinated about how operators are still running most of their business with pen and paper,” Swoop CEO and co-founder Amir Ghorbani said in a statement. Ghorbani has witnessed first hand the constraints of these small operators. During high school and college, Ghorbani helped with his parents’ limousine business. The experience prompted him to seek a solution. 
 “I saw a huge opportunity to help these small mom and pop shops, in an under-digitized industry, where no operator has more than 1% market share,” Ghorbani added.
Ghorbani began by building a group transportation booking platform used by companies like Airbnb, Google and Nike. Through those bookings the companies saw an opportunity to build business management software for vehicle operators.
Swoop’s SaaS platform lets companies book and dispatch rides, track vehicles and communicate with customers. It also acts as a central hub for payments and other bookkeeping. The tool is designed to smooth out the booking process as well as increase vehicle utilization, which is currently at 4.9%, according to the company. Swoop also passes on leads from companies that use the booking platform to the operators using its SaaS tool.
For now, the focus is on local transportation companies, not public transit, which is a sector that Uber is chasing after.
COVID-19, which has suspended most group outings, has upended these local transportation operators. Swoop says it has adjusted its platform to help these operators survive. The company told TechCrunch that it is helping operators repurpose their vehicles to ship goods rather than people. For instance, large vans once used for corporate outings can now be marketed to food wholesalers or companies that need local package delivery. The platform is also being used to connect operators with companies like Amazon that provide transportation to shuttle essential factory workers.
Swoop said COVID-19 might end up accelerating its business ramp as operators are being forced to evaluate their businesses and seek out new ways to generate revenue and reduce costs."

Despite its small size and low profile, the Oura Ring is still a connected device, with an internal battery, and the ability to talk to a smartphone via Bluetooth to transmit the data its sensors collect. In the box, you also get a USB-C stand for the Oura Ring that powers it up via induction charging.
The built-in battery is good for up to seven days of continuous use and that includes wearing the Oura Ring during sleep. During my usage, that seemed to be an accurate estimate. In general, though, the battery life just seemed to be ‘long enough,’ prompting me not to really think about specific spans, and charging is so quick that it’s easy to just remember to put it on the dock occasionally when it’s convenient (I would often do this during the work day while at my desk, where I keep the Oura dock). Oura’s app also sends helpful notifications to remind you to charge before bed when you’re getting close to the end of your ring’s battery life.
Design
Oura’s design for this most recent iteration of their Ring is fantastic both as just a piece of jewelry, and doubly so as a connected health and activity tracker. It’s available in two styles, called “Balance” and “Heritage,” both of which come in multiple metallic finishes. There’s a polished silver and gloss black option for both, while “Balance” has a premium-priced version with inlaid diamonds, and “Heritage” has a matte black finish option (which I reviewed).
All the various finishes ore made of a lightweight titanium, with a molded plastic inner to protect the sensors and provide transparency for them to work. The exterior finishes are all coated with a scratch-resistant outer layer but just like with just about any other metal jewelry, scratch-resistant isn’t scratch proof. The matte black finish I reviewed is definitely showing some wear and tear after multiple weeks of use, but that’s something I was fully expecting, and it’s surprisingly resilient given how often it comes in contact with other metal surfaces, stone and whatever else you come in contact with on a daily basis. The minor blemishes that appear lend it a pleasing patina, rather than negatively impacting its aesthetics, in my opinion.
The Oura Ring is also fixed in terms of sizing and fit, and the company has come up with a clever way to handle ensuring a good fit for customers. They offer a free sizing kit that they ship out first so that you can figure out which Oura size is most comfortable, and decide on which finger you want to wear it. Size is important because you want the Oura Ring to fit snugly enough that it won’t fall off or shift around too much, but also not too snugly that it becomes uncomfortable.
Ultimately, the design is fantastic because it’s both an attractive ring, and an incredibly comfortable device to wear all day and through the night. Unlike even an Apple Watch or other wrist-worn wearable, there’s virtually no adjustment required for getting used to wearing it while sleeping, or any discomfort from various types of bands. It’s the first wearable I’ve used where I truly was able to forget that I was wearing one at all, and it’s one that no one else will realize you’re wearing, either.
Features and performance
So what does the Oura Ring actually track? A lot of things, actually. It measures sleep, as mentioned, as well as various other metrics under two other broad categories: Readiness, and Activity. Sleep, Readiness and Activity all provide one overall summary score out of 100 to give you a topline sense of where you’re at, but each is actually calculated from a range of sub-metrics that add up to that larger score.
Oura’s sleep tracking is much more in-depth than the forthcoming Apple Watch sleep tracking that Apple is releasing with its next watchOS update in the fall. It monitors when you go to sleep, how long you sleep, how much of that qualifies as “deep” and how much is “REM,” and gives you a metric or you sleep efficiency, your time in bed, your total sleep time and more. Readiness tracks your ambient body temperature, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and your resting heart rate, while activity automatically measures calorie burn, inactive time, you steps and how close you are to your overall activity goal.

For all three of these categories, you can dive into each individual sub-metric and see trends over time or individual scores per day, but you can also just look at the overall score, which is provided in a feed-like dashboard in the app and accompanied by practical, actionable advise about what to do with your day, your activity or your sleep habits based on that score and how it’s trending.
It’s at once both the easiest to understand health tracking app I’ve used, and also one of those with the most depth when it comes to digging into what is actually being tracked, and what that means in greater detail. And because the app focuses heavily on establishing a baseline and then monitoring deviations from that baseline and providing advice based on that, it’s more likely to be useful and specifically relevant to you.
Bottom line
With most wearable tech, including the Apple Watch, I periodically have a sort of internal revolt where I end up finding them too much of an intrusion, or too much of a hassle to maintain continuous use. With the Oura Ring, health self-monitoring reaches a perfect pinnacle of combining convenience, with useful and actionable information, with an unobtrusive and attractive design that actually makes me want to put it on.
The jury remains out on whether the Oura Ring can actually accurately detect COVID-19 or anticipate the onset of its symptoms, but regardless, it’s a fantastic personal health tracking device and a great tool for anyone looking to take more control over how they feel on a daily basis. And by actively establishing an individual baseline and comparing your actual overall state to that every day, Oura provides one of the best potential platforms for long-term personal wellness insight out there."

The Consumer Technology Association announced Tuesday that CES 2021 will be an ""all-digital event"" running from Jan. 6 to Jan. 9, 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The press release was light on specifics on how it'll actually work, but the point is clear: For the first time since 1967, there won't be a CES as we know it in Las Vegas or anywhere else.
Again, we still don't know exactly how the new digital CES will work for exhibitors and press. More than 170,000 people attended the last one in January, so there are plenty of mouths to feed as CES moves to an entirely virtual presentation. 
SEE ALSO: Best tech of CES 2020
This development shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, even though CES waited until now to drop the charade that the 2021 show would happen as previously scheduled. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there were actually some concerns that CES may have helped spread the disease. Now, given the disastrous rise of case and death numbers in the U.S. since then, it's no wonder that people don't want to congregate in crowded conference halls and casinos in just a few months.
Don't worry, we'll still have plenty of coverage of all the latest weird TVs, internet-connected refrigerators, and brain-scanning toilets here at Mashable. We'll just learn about them over video calls instead of at the Las Vegas Convention Center."

What Scott and Fortnite-maker Epic Games delivered, however, is a gloriously surreal “astronomical” event, with an enormous, kaiju-sized Scott avatar looming over players and teleporting around the venue while the visuals around him get increasingly psychedelic. It’s something that could only happen in a virtual concert, and that’s what makes it delightful.
Plus, the event was viewed by far more people than could ever pack into even the largest concert venue. Epic Games said 12.3 million concurrent players participated, a new record for the game.

The milestone caps off a related campaign by Uber Eats to match up to $3 million in contributions made by customers. Uber Eats is sending its $3 million in matched funds to the National Restaurant Association’s Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. The company had previously donated $2 million to RERF.
The matching campaign has ended. However, the restaurant contribution feature, which was first rolled out in New York and is now in 20 countries, will continue.
The restaurant contribution feature was developed by a team of engineers in a flurry of activity over about seven days, according to Therese Lim, who leads the restaurant product management team for Uber Eats.
“There was no executive who said ‘oh we need to build this feature, you all go build this now,” Lim said, adding that this was a grassroots effort prompted by the wave of restaurants that were forced to close regular dine-in eating due to the spread of COVID-19. Lim said Uber Eats users started reaching out to employees via LinkedIn, email and other means to ask how they could help restaurants.
“We started to see restaurants get impacted severely by this,” Lim said. “This was particularly true as the various states started implementing shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders.”
The team had two primary concerns beyond the basic backend operations about the feature. They didn’t want it to cannibalize the amount of tips that users gave delivery workers, nor did they want it to cause customers to buy less from restaurants.
The team started to roll out the feature in a small area within New York City on April 1 to make sure tipping of delivery workers wasn’t impacted. The feature launched April 3 across the entire city and then expanded over the next week to the rest of the United States. The contribution feature is now live on the Uber Eats in 20 countries.
“We didn’t want to introduce anything that actually hurts restaurants,” Lim said. “It was important to make sure we weren’t introducing  friction into the experience that would cause a user to become impatient or displeased with the outcomes and maybe not actually finish their order.”
Those concerns didn’t bear out, according to data compiled since the app feature launched. Customers not only tipped more, they were also frequent users of Uber Eats.
Users who made restaurant contributions tipped their couriers 30% to 50% more than orders without a contribution, according to Uber. About 15% of Uber Eats customers in the U.S. who made a restaurant contribution were repeat contributors.
Data also shows that early dinner time, around 6 p.m., was the most generous time period, according to Lim. Dinner time, between 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., was the most popular for contributions, making up 60% of contribution dollars.
And certain foods, namely international cuisine, encouraged more contributions from users. French, Ethiopian, Argentinian and Thai restaurants had the highest contribution rates, according to Uber.
Some states were more generous than others. The top five most generous states, by percentage of active Uber Eats users who made at least one contribution, were Washington, Vermont, Montana, Connecticut, and South Carolina."

Given the disproportionate impact the coronavirus has on people of color and low-income communities, the tech industry a predominantly white male ecosystem that struggles to foster diversity and inclusion has an opportunity to approach this new reality through an equitable lens.
Kapor Capital’s Freada Kapor Klein and Mitch Kapor
As part of Extra Crunch Live, our new virtual speaker series with trusted tech experts, I’ll talk to Kapor Capital’s Freada Kapor Klein and Mitch Kapor on Tuesday, April 28 at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern. Full details are at the bottom of this post.
Freada Kapor Klein, a founding partner at Kapor Capital, has advocated for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry for more than a decade. Through Kapor Capital, she invests in startups focused on social impact and closing gaps for people of color, as well as folks in low-income communities. Kapor Klein is also a founding member of Project Include, which works to help founders and investors implement effective diversity and inclusion strategies.
Mitch Kapor, also a founding partner at Kapor Capital, similarly invests in startups geared toward social good. Prior to Kapor Capital, he co-founded The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that protects digital rights and civil liberties. Together, Mitch and Freada also lead the Kapor Center for Social Impact to remove barriers in education and in the workplace.
I’m looking forward to chatting with Freada and Mitch about how startups should approach this ever-changing new reality, strategies for helping companies eliminate inequities and the differences and similarities between how the recent pandemic and the dot-com era are shaping the tech industry.

It’s how she’s been able to support her family, she told TechCrunch. But she says she has noticed an increase in third-party bot activity that has made shopping “nearly impossible.”
Despite the high demand for Instacart amid the COVID-19 pandemic, shoppers like Carmichael are facing difficulties claiming orders within the shopper app. This is the result of what appears to be some sophisticated work by third-party apps like Ninja Hours, Sushopper and others.
“They grab the batches within a blink of an eye,” Carmichael said. “I can barely see the amounts offered. Sometimes I may even just receive a notification because the batch has been taken before it was even registered in my app.”
Ninja Hours appeared on the scene about a year ago in the Little Havana community in Miami, according to Logan B, an Instacart shopper with experience using Ninja Hours. Shoppers could pay Ninja Hours about $25 to $35 a week to get access to hours for the following week and in exchange, Ninja Hours would take over the shopper’s app to claim hours on their behalf. This was during a time when Instacart required shoppers to claim hours rather than on-demand orders.
Ninja Hours also provided account activations for immigrant workers without proper documentation. For $200, according to Logan, undocumented immigrants could pay Ninja Hours to create an account for them so they could shop.
Logan says Instacart eventually caught on to Ninja Hours, which forced the service to shut down. Ninja Hours then became Hours For You, which emerged in the fall, Logan says. Hours For You then folded into Sushopper earlier this year.
“The site would go offline for a week and then they would send you a text message,” he said. “It was always written in Spanish — really targeting the Latino community.”
Other shoppers didn’t seem to notice this was going on, Logan says, because Sushopper would claim the orders before they would even appear on the apps. But now that Sushopper has shut down, there’s a new service — one that is not quite as fast.
“There is definitely still a service out here because I’m not getting anything at all,” Logan, who has since stopped paying for early access to orders, said. “There’s no way anyone would be able to grab it that fast.”
What’s happening is that shoppers can see the orders come in, but then they pretty much immediately disappear. Below, you can see a gif of how the moment batches become available, one order immediately disappears.
With this new service, which he doesn’t know the name of, the messages are coming in Portuguese. That leads him to believe it’s run by a different group of people.
“It’s so mainstream now and it seems just about everywhere is having a problem,” Logan said.
Instacart has acknowledged this is a practice that goes on but says that this is not a breach of its platform.
“The safety and security of the entire Instacart community is our top priority,” an Instacart spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We have several robust security measures in place to ensure the security of the Instacart platform. Selling or purchasing batches is not an authorized use of the Instacart platform and is a violation of our Terms of Service. Anyone found to be engaged in any type of inappropriate or fraudulent use of the Instacart platform, including selling or purchasing batches or utilizing any of these types of services, will have their accounts immediately deactivated. We advise shoppers not to engage with any individual or company that claims to provide priority access to batches on the platform, particularly those that request sensitive information such as Instacart usernames, passwords, and/or credit card information.”
Despite Instacart’s efforts, it’s gotten so bad that Carmichael ends up sitting in her car for hours waiting for a batch she can try to snag before the bots.
“My thumbs are sore and eyes are strained,” she said. “I’ve only managed to grab four orders. My livelihood is literally being snatched out from beneath me.”
She and others have reached out to Instacart to report the issue, Carmichael said. But in her experience and the experience of those she knows, Instacart has not responded. Some shoppers, however, are able to get through to Instacart support about this issue. As you can see below, Instacart acknowledges an issue and told one shopper it will “be fixed as soon as possible.”
Before the bot activity ramped up in Orlando, Carmichael was receiving about 20 orders a week. During the week of March 16 – 22, for example, Carmichael completed 26 batches, according to documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Last week she was only able to claim 11. This week, she has only been able to get four batches.
This increase in bot activity comes at a time when Instacart is ramping up its hiring of full-service shoppers. Just yesterday, Instacart announced it’s adding 250,000 more shoppers to meet demand. That came after Instacart announced last month its plans to hire another 300,000 shoppers.
The increased number of full-service shoppers coupled with third-party bots quickly claiming orders, it’s no wonder why some shoppers are feeling frustrated. Behind the scenes, Instacart is working to ban unauthorized third parties from accepting batches. In the meantime, the company is recommending shoppers not engage with those services."

For those among us who are unable to leave our homes at all as COVID-19 virus rages, online retail and food services have been a kind of lifeline. 
But as contact-free delivery becomes the norm, it can be easy to forgot all the people working to provide those services at risk to their health. And more often than not, employees are working for low wages or tips. 
A number of protests have been organized at companies like Amazon and Instagram in the intervening weeks and months, but a wide-scale, cross-company event hasnt really surfaced. That could change on May 1, as employees mark the longstanding tradition of International Workers’ Day with a May Day general strike. 
Material for the event has been circulating online, rebadged Essential Workers Day, as a nod to the exemptions to stay at home orders for retail and food delivery, among others. The event is framed as a combination strike and boycott, targeted at Amazon/Whole Foods, Instacart and Target/Shipt (as well as Walmart and FedEx, according to various sources). 
Specific demands differ from employer to employer, but workers have broadly asked for essential health protections, sick leave and hazard pay as the pandemic has continued to wear on and profits have spiked for many providers. 
Vice spoke to Christian Smalls, one of the organizers, the Staten Island Amazon employee who was fired after organizing a walkout at one of the companys fulfillment centers. We formed an alliance between a bunch of different companies because we all have one common goal which is to save the lives of workers and communities, he told the site. Right now isnt the time to open up the economy. Amazon is a breeding ground [for COVID] which is spreading right now through multiple facilities.
Amazon workers have been particularly vocal about the retail giants response to the pandemic. In addition to Smalls, two other employees who were publicly critical of the company were fired by Amazon though the company denied the direct link. Instacart employees have also organized boycotts and strikes, including one in late March. 
We remain singularly focused on the health and safety of the Instacart community. Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time, the company said in a statement. We welcome all feedback from shoppers and we will continue to enhance their experience to ensure this important community is supported.
Other companies have previously issued similar statements regarding employment during the crisis. Weve reached out to them for additional comment on the planned protests."

India’s largest cell network Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance, launched its coronavirus self-test symptom checker in late March, just before the Indian government imposed a strict nationwide lockdown to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. The symptom checker allows anyone to check their symptoms from their phone or Jio’s website to see if they may have become infected with COVID-19.
But a security lapse exposed one of the symptom checker’s core databases to the internet without a password, TechCrunch has found.

Security researcher Anurag Sen found the database on May 1, just after it was first exposed, and informed TechCrunch to notify the company. Jio quickly pulled the system offline after TechCrunch made contact. It’s not known if anyone else accessed the database.
“We have taken immediate action,” said Jio spokesperson Tushar Pania. “The logging server was for monitoring performance of our website, intended for the limited purpose of people doing a self-check to see if they have any COVID-19 symptoms.”
The database contains millions of logs and records starting April 17 through to the time that the database was pulled offline. Although the server contained a running log of website errors and other system messages, it also ingested vast numbers of user-generated self-test data. Each self-test was logged in the database and included a record of who took the test such as “self” or a relative, their age, and their gender.
The data also included the person’s user agent, a small snippet of information about the user’s browser version and the operating system, often used to load the website properly but can also be used to track a user’s online activity.
The database also contains individual records of those who signed up to create a profile, allowing users to update their symptoms over time. These records contained the answers to each question asked by the symptom checker, including what symptoms they are experiencing, who they have been in contact with, and what health conditions they may have.
Some of the records also contained the user’s precise location, but only if the user allowed the symptom checker access to their browser or phone’s location data.
We’ve posted a redacted portion of one of the records below.

From one sample of data we obtained, we found thousands of users’ precise geolocation from across India. TechCrunch was able to identify people’s homes using the latitude and longitude records found in the database.
Most of the location data is clustered around major cities, like Mumbai and Pune. TechCrunch also found users in the United Kingdom and North America.
The exposure could not come at a more critical time for the Indian telecoms giant. Last week Facebook invested $5.7 billion for a near-10% stake in Jio’s Platforms, valuing the Reliance subsidiary at about $66 billion.
Jio did not answer our follow-up questions, and the company did not say if it will inform those who used the symptom tracker of the security lapse."

The company announced today its success as one of the first retailers to use TikTok’s “Shop Now” buttons that allow consumers make purchases through links posted to TikTok. Though the implementation is still in the early stages, Levi’s says it has already seen high engagement and increased traffic to its website, as a result of initial tests.
To send traffic to its e-commerce site, Levi’s recently partnered with TikTok influencers Callen Schaub, Cosette Rinab, Gabby Morrison and Everett Williams who used Levis’ laser-powered Future Finish 3-D denim customization technology to create their own customized denim. While the collaboration itself began before the shelter-in-place orders rolled out across the U.S., the resulting videos were only posted last week.
TikTok users viewing the influencers’ videos, which appeared on TikTok as in-feed ads, could then click to buy the same design on Levi.com up until the experiment wrapped on April 19.
Levi’s reports that watch time for these videos were twice as long as the TikTok platform average.

In addition, Levi’s notes that product views to Levi.com’s “Future Finish” pages more than doubled for every product included in the experience.
Though these are not hard numbers, few retailers have yet to share the results of their TikTok-powered social commerce efforts. In fact, the “Shop Now” call-to-action button itself is fairly new, so only a handful of advertisers have used the option to date.
TikTok is not the first social network the Levi’s brand has worked with — it also has similar partnerships with top social platforms like Snap, Instagram, and Pinterest. However, the company said it was drawn to TikTok due the size of its audience, noting that in November 2018 TikTok was then seeing 680 million monthly active users worldwide, and is now estimated to have as high as 800 million. Levi’s also noted that nearly 60% of that user base is in between the ages fo 16 to 24.
TikTok, meanwhile, has been dabbling in social commerce for over a year through a variety of efforts.
For example, AdWeek in April 2019 reported on Hollister’s participation in a program that allowed retailers to run in-feed ads that directed customers to its e-commerce site by a “Shop Now” button. And Digiday last July noted Poshmark had done the same. In August 2019, Kroger became the first brand to try a new Hashtag Challenge Plus feature, which added a shoppable component to a TikTok hashtag.
Last November, TikTok also began to allow some TikTok users to add e-commerce links to their posts and their bios. Many of the beta participants testing this feature began linking from their video directly to Amazon, The WSJ had reported at the time.
In the case of the Levi’s influencer program, the videos from the creators ran as in-feed ads, linked to the retailer’s website. Some influencers also included a Levi’s website link in their bio, but this is separate from the advertiser-facing feature. (See photo on right).
“TikTok was the perfect platform for us to expand our efforts in social commerce. Over the last decade, weve been on a journey to not only grow our digital footprint, but also help our fans buy our products at the point of inspiration, when they see something they love,” said Brady Stewart, managing director, U.S. Direct to Consumer, in a statement about the TikTok partnership. “As consumer behavior shifts over the coming months and people explore different online channels for shopping and engaging with brands, we are here to connect with consumers, wherever they are,” he added.
The line between social media and commerce has been blurring for years, thanks to influencer-fueled advertising, in-feed ad units, shoppable media, and more. Instagram today event lets you shop from some retailers without leaving its app. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Marketplace has turned into an eBay and Craigslist-sized rival and its business Pages help customers and brands connect in a number of ways.
TikTok, however, has only dipped a toe in the water of social commerce as of yet. But given its app’s sizable reach, particularly among Gen Z, it’s an area to watch. And as the pandemic forces more retailers to remain closed to foot traffic in stores, being able to attract young shoppers to their online shops will be more valuable than ever."

That’s the thesis put forward by Salman Ullah, co-founder and managing director of Merus Capital.
As COVID-19 spreads globally, he argues that countries with national healthcare along with fiscal and monetary policies that balance the interests of citizens versus those of corporations are better positioned to navigate the pandemic.
More broadly, investors prefer to invest in stable and resilient economies, and resilience depends on the ability of governments to respond to a crisis, let alone one on such an unprecedented scale. For investors, the strength of national infrastructure and political institutions in many European countries is a net positive and a stark contrast to Trump’s U.S.
Germany, where Merus has already made several investments, is cited as an example of a European country that has become more attractive to Silicon Valley investors in recent years. Not only is the cost of starting up in Germany lower, but Ullah argues there’s been a “cultural shift” amongst young people who now view startups as a viable career path, while the coronavirus crisis and the German government’s response is making ecosystems such as Berlin and Munich even more attractive.
“Your dollar goes much further in Europe, rents are lower, everyone gets free healthcare, essentially,” says Ullah during a call. “And the level of education and expertise in computer science in particular is no better or worse than in the U.S. And I think the pandemic has just kind of reinforced that.”
In a time of such uncertainly and the economic shock that comes with that, Ullah notes that in European countries like Germany, citizens aren’t worried about the personal cost of healthcare. He also points to the way German finance minister Olaf Scholz has pledged unlimited credit for businesses affected by the pandemic alongside an expansion of its short-time work scheme, which gives support for companies that are forced to reduce working hours of their employees."

In a joint letter addressed to Commission EVP Margrethe Vesta…,http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/call-for-eu-state-aid-rules-to-flex-for-startups/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gettyimages-612861656.jpg?w=600,2020-05-18T15:35:01Z,"European startups are calling for more flexibility in EU state aid rules to allow national governments to provide liquidity for the region’s fledgling digital businesses during the COVID-19 crisis.
In a joint letter addressed to Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, more than a dozen startup associations from across the bloc have called for rules to be adapted to ensure digital businesses are not blocked from receiving any emergency state aid.
In March the Commission applied an update to EU state aid rules clarifying how Member States can provide support to homegrown businesses during the coronavirus emergency.
However the startup association representatives co-signing the latter — which include reps from Coadec in the UK, France Digitale, Germany’s Bundesverband Deutsche Startups, Startup Poland and several others — are concerned the framework is being too narrowly drawn where digital upstarts are concerned.
They point out that startups may be intentionally operating at a loss as a calculated bet on gaining scale down the line, making the current rules a poor fit.
“Startups across Europe report that the Temporary Framework for State Aid is not yet giving enough flexibility to Member States to support startup ecosystems,” they write. “The definition of an undertaking in difficulty is intended to apply to loss-making businesses. Such a definition will often be enough to deny support being given to such a business. However many startups are loss-making by design in their first years, as they are taking a calculated bet on exponential growth and associated job growth that will emerge in the following years. 
“Only taking the current cash flow into account belittles the economic potential of these startups and prevents them from receiving much-needed support. In doing so it can undermine the post COVID-19 recovery, as it is todays loss making startups which will be the driver for economic and job growth in the future.”
The letter goes on to call for startups to “receive the support that other economic actors are also receiving”.
“Startups provide a key opportunity for our economies and societies to recover as we come out of COVID,” they suggest, adding: “They will play a central part in re-growing our economy and crucially in doing so on a more carbon-neutral footing.”
We reached out to the Commission for a request for comment but at the time of writing it had not responded.
While it might a bit of a contradiction for VC-backed tech businesses which may choose to operate at a loss during ‘normal’ times to be calling for liquidity help now, Benedikt Blomeyer, EU policy director at Allied for Startups — one of a number of startup associations signing the letter — told us the argument is simply that Europe’s startups should be able to expect the same kind of support that is being extended to other types of businesses.
A number of EU Member States have laid out major support programs for startups to date — such as France’s $4.3BN liquidity support plan, announced in March; and a match fund revealed last month in the UK (which remains an EU member until the end of this year).
But the contention appears to be that liquidity isn’t flowing to all the European startups that need it, nor arriving in a timely enough way.
“For startups, loss-making doesnt mean that it is necessarily a failing business,” Blomeyer told TechCrunch. “The bigger picture is that we are looking at startup ecosystems as key providers of jobs and economic growth coming out of the crisis. Some startups will fail, just like other businesses. But the question is whether startups should be able to access the same kind of support that other companies can to help them survive this crisis. We believe they should.”
Commenting on the issue in a statement, Paolo Palmigiano, head of competition, EU &amp; trade for law firm Taylor Wessing, agreed the EU state aid rules may struggle to accommodate Internet businesses.
“The criteria introduced by the Commission in the Framework that a company must be viable as of 31 Dec 2019 makes sense in the old brick and mortar world. A company which would have gone in any case bankrupt, even without the current crisis, should not receive aid. The criteria start to be more complex and causes difficulties for tech companies which might not be profitable at the time although they could be in the future,” he said.
“The state aid rules were created in the 60s at a time when the single market did not exist and Europe had a lot of old-style industries (like steel). We need to see how the Commission react but I can see them struggling how do you distinguish a loss making tech company which in any case would have gone bankrupt from a loss making company that will become profitable in the short term?”
Asked how it believes the Commission should replace the current viability criteria and assess which startups merit help and which don’t, Allied for Startups’ Blomeyer called for a blanket exemption for startups founded over the last half decade or more.
There could be a clear exemption from the UID test for companies that have been set up in the last 5-7 years,” he suggested. “We need to underline that this is an unprecedented crisis that requires extraordinary measures. So while in normal times a regular process of assessing whether/how to assess startups might have worked, now the ecosystems that built them are melting away before our eyes because of the barriers. The basic conundrum is that it is unclear whether a loss-making startup is indeed not a viable business. This needs resolving.”
In what now feels like an earlier age late last year — as European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen was taking up her five-year mandate — tech-driven change was identified as one of her key policy priorities, with digitization and a green deal taking center stage, alongside a push for European tech sovereignty and support for homegrown startups to scale up.
So if Europe’s startups are feeling overlooked now, in the middle of an unprecedented economic shock, that hardly reflects well on the Commission’s claimed high tech policy goals."

Within the first few days of launch, Naza booked more than 300 appointments and all was well until it wasn’t. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shelter-in-place ordinance in San Francisco, Naza shut down its brick-and-mortar location in March.
“We had intended to focus on the salon for a little longer than 20 days,” Montgomery told TechCrunch. “But the universe had other plans.”
In light of the store’s temporary closure, Naza has fast-tracked its style boxes to help women do their hair at home. It’s everything you need to learn a hairstyle, Montgomery said, likening it to a meal kit.  There are three kits: one for people who want to wear their hair naturally, one for crochet goddess locks and one for braid twists. But for those that need more help, Naza is also offering Zoom parties where people can learn how to do their hair.
“They’re skills that sometime between the age of six and twelve, a lot of black girls learned,” Montgomery said. “But there’s a secret society of us that never got the memo. Now, if you missed that memo, here’s how you can make up the time.”
Naza launched these boxes on Tuesday and sold out in less than 24 hours, but more will be available in the coming weeks. They are currently available for pre-order on Naza’s site.
“These will continue post-pandemic,” she said. “The curation of products was sort of fast-tracked. This would’ve been maybe eight months to a year down the line. Something that has been really exciting in the grand scheme of things is how differently founders are forced to look at the product roadmap. What is appropriate for right now versus what we thought would be appropriate for right now.”
Montgomery recognizes that some people may see haircare as self-indulgent, especially during a time when people are dying. But self-care, she says, is one of the ways people can get through these times.
“Thinking through how the majority of our customers are black and brown women and how they’re being disproportionately affected — whether that be by layoffs or by the actual virus itself,” she said. “There’s a lot going on in life and also mentally, so we’re thinking through how we can act as a place of support and a little joy.”
Beyond the pandemic, Montgomery feels optimistic about the long-term success of Naza. For one, it raised $1 million in capital from Initialized Capital earlier this year. Secondly, the style boxes are doing well “has given us space,” she said.
“We are in a position that is different from small businesses in that we have a little bit of runway to be able to pay our people and ensure there is still a business standing afterward,” she said."

Waymo will start its driving operations in the Phoenix area again, a decision the company says it made after discussions with “our teams, partners and local and state authorities,” before restoring them in other cities, including San Francisco, Detroit and Los Angeles.
Arizona’s stay at home order expires on May 15, but academic experts have expressed concern that Arizona hasnt reached the peak of its COVID-19 outbreak yet and some who worked with the state government recently told the Washington Post that they were asked to “pause” work on projections and modeling.
The companys announcement says this is the first step in a “tiered approach to safely resume our operations,” starting with its test fleet and then eventually offering Waymo One, its self-driving ride hailing service, again.
Waymo said it is following safety guidance from local and state governments, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Safety measures Waymo has implemented include requiring personnel to wear face masks in its facilities or vehicles, unless someone is driving alone in a vehicle and a partnership with AutoNation to clean cars several times a day.
The company says it has also limited maximum capacity and put in social distancing guidelines for its work areas, created health and safety training for its team and will work with occupational healthcare providers to screen people before they enter facilities."

In a recent catch-up with him about work and life during COVID-19, we wound up talking at some length about Facebook, which is seeing record use across its social networking, messaging, and live-streaming platforms right now and will likely continue to do so throughout this pandemic.
We asked Jan Kamps, who joined Facebook around 2006 — when it first expanded beyond its roots on college campuses to enable anyone over age 13 with a valid email address to join — if we could share some of his thoughts as a kind of snapshot. They represent only his views and opinions but highlight a broader struggle that many Facebook users around the world — currently isolated from friends and family — are experiencing as their relationship with the tech giant evolves, and its power accordingly grows at an accelerated pace.
Jan Kamps’s comments have been edited lightly for length and clarity.
I take breaks from Facebook from time to time, because it’s a little bit much and occasionally, I think, they change your algorithm, so sometimes it just gets real depressing, and I’m just going to vote with my mouse cursor and get the hell out of there for a bit. And then I come back. And then it’s like more more friends doing updates and stuff. 
I want my friends’ life updates. I don’t necessarily want the weight of the world on my shoulders. I made a conscious choice a while ago to stop reading the news just for my well-being. And if it gets in through the back door through Facebook, I’m like, Look, I don’t want that.
Just a little vignette from this morning: I woke up, I overslept slightly, and I got on Facebook, and there was a friend who was doing a live stream because she decided to try and cheer people up a little bit. She was playing her ukulele and just singing for 15 minutes. She had, like, 20 of her friends watching and was like, “Hope everyone has a great day.” That didn’t happen before everybody had to go into isolation.
There’ve been a whole bunch of groups that have popped up, as well as some older groups that became reactivated. I actually started one for the Human Awareness Institute, which has this concept of a large group share, where basically people stand up in front of a room of people and share something that is real and heartfelt and pertinent.  They’ve had to cancel their workshops, because it’s just not safe to do it right now. But it turns out the digital version of that is juicy and beautiful and connected. And the outpouring of comments you get on those shares — people leap in with words of support, words of encouragement, and that’s just not something I’ve seen on Facebook in such a long time.
My big realization, which I guess is kind of an obvious realization, is that it’s just a tool, and we get to choose what we use that tool for. And if we choose it to be a place to, to spread joy and share creative projects rather than just, ‘Look at this cool sandwich I made,’ I feel like it’s actually possible. And if I feel really good about seeing other people that do that, I might do that, too. 
I have a love-hate relationship with with Facebook. I have signed off before for weeks, even months. I am grateful for the internet and the information that is available, but I feel like basic source criticism isn’t something that isn’t taught at all in the U.S., meaning that when you read something on the internet, do you know whether or not it is real? In Norway, where I grew up, you get taught as part of history class to criticize the source itself, to ask: Is this a reliable source? Was this kind of the ‘victor writes the history’? How do you piece together sources to get a good feeling for what really happened?’ 
The fact that fake news has even slightly been able to take hold is terrifying to me. I was in a yoga class the other day, and the yoga teacher had this little spray bottle [to clean her mat] and she said, ‘There are essential oils in here. You can use it on your hands on your mat, on your face — you can even drink it because it’s edible.’ It’s like, ‘Look, if it’s fucking edible, it’s not gonna do anything to a virus,’ I mean, maybe some essential oils might help get some viruses. I have no idea. But Lysol was invented for a reason.
People allow themselves to get so bubbled and so echo chambered into believing what they want to believe. I mean, the anti-vaxxer movement is one example. There’s a lot of other dumb news out there, to the point that now that if I really want to know what’s happening, I go to the BBC or maybe the New York Times or The Washington Post or any of the other big stalwarts of journalism, because I know they have some sort of process in place to make sure that what is published is actually relatively sensible, and even then, I make certain I’m not on the opinion pages. I don’t want an opinion about COVID. I want ice-cold facts that are verified. 
That’s the big challenge with the internet. There’s more information available right now than there ever has been. You can find the best possible information if you want to. You can go to a medical journal and read about coronaviruses. But there is a lot of news absolutely 100% made up and people still believe it. And I’m like, Look, either everybody collectively is really fucking stupid, or we just want to believe.
I don’t really have an opinion on whether Facebook has a role to play there, whether it’s meant to police what is real and isn’t real. But the fact that it is so easy to share and spread misinformation is not helping us when there’s a massive pandemic going on."

CNN was first to report that executives approved a new policy that would require drivers and riders to wear face masks or coverings in some markets, including the U.S.. TechCrunch confirmed Monday that Uber has developed a policy for certain markets.
Uber still faces one considerable challenge: securing enough face masks and other supplies to protect drivers. The company said multiple orders have either been delayed or canceled as from major manufacturers prioritize healthcare workers and other first responders.
It’s also not clear how Uber will enforce its policy.
“As countries reopen, Uber is focused on safety and proceeding with caution,” an Uber spokesperson said in a emailed statement. “Today, we continue to ask riders to stay home if they can, while shipping safety supplies to drivers who are providing essential trips. At the same time, our teams are preparing for the next phase of recovery, where we will all have a role to play. We’ll communicate updates directly to users when ready, but in the meantime, we continue to urge all riders and drivers to wear masks or face coverings when using Uber.”
Uber has been encouraging riders to stay home through an in-app message and through marketing such as TV spots. The app is still available and people have used it to take trips to grocery stores, to essential jobs and pharmacies. Uber has urged, but not yet required, riders and drivers to wear masks or face coverings.
As the COVID-19 pandemic swept through Europe and North America, Uber drivers have found themselves on the front lines, often times transporting healthcare and other essential workers who were potentially exposed to the disease.
Uber announced last month that it would buy and ship face masks to active drivers and delivery workers globally. However, COVID-19 has squeezed global supplies for face masks and disinfectant. Uber and other ride-share drivers have reported problems accessing the supplies.
In the first week of April, Uber said it began receiving and then shipping about 500,000 ear-loop face masks to drivers. The company initially targeted the most active drivers in COVID-19 hotspots such as New York City and Los Angeles. (In LA, Mayor Eric Garcetti signed a Worker Protection Order that requires companies to provide essential workers with personal protective equipment.) Uber said it also is prioritizing cities and states such as San Francisco, Washington D.C. and New Jersey that have asked drivers to wear face covers.
Uber said it will make these supplies available to all active drivers as more become available. Uber’s goal is to be able to offer masks nationwide regardless of local regulations.
As of this week, Uber has either shipped or preparing to ship 1.4 million ear-loop face masks in the United States. The company also started in early April to ship disinfectant to drivers in Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, Seattle and Washington D.C."

In 2019, Jumia became the first VC funded tech company in Africa to list on a major exchange, the NYSE. Based in Nairobi, Twiga raised a $30 million Series B round in October and announced plans to expand its food supply-chain business to West Africa.
Both companies are backed by venture capital from U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs .
Per the partnership, Jumia will sell bundles of Twiga’s fresh produce on its e-commerce website. Jumia’s delivery fleet will pick up orders from Twiga’s sorting and distribution centers and then complete last mile, contact free delivery. The transactions will be cash only using Jumia’s JumiaPay app, according to Jumia Kenya CEO Sam Chappatte.

The arrangement is meant to leverage the strengths of both companies, while providing a safer and more affordable way for households to obtain foodstuffs through the coronavirus crisis, which started to hit East Africa last month.
Co-founded in Nairobi in 2014 by Peter Njonjo and Grant Brooke, Twiga Foods is focused primarily on connecting the produce of Kenya’s farmers more efficiently to pricing and marketplaces. The company serves around 3,000 outlets a day with produce through a network of 17,000 farmers and 8,000 vendors.
Twiga will benefit from Jumia’s B2C e-commerce platform and Twiga from Jumia’s B2B produce network, according to Jumia’s Kenya CEO.
On the product offerings, “We pulled together the core basics that a family would need for a week or two weeks,” Chappatte told TechCrunch on a call from Nairobi.
“It’s 28 kilograms of fruit and vegetables. It’s delivered in an hour and a half and they save 50% versus supermarkets.”

The partnership comes as the coronavirus has hit Africa and actors across the continent’s tech ecosystem have begun to develop practices to maintain operations and stem the spread.
By WHO stats Tuesday there were 21,388 COVID-19 cases in Africa and 877 confirmed virus related deaths, up from 345 cases and 7 deaths on March 18. Kenya ranks 13th in coronavirus cases on the continent.
Countries such as South Africa, Kenya  and Nigeria which happen to be Africas top tech hubs have imposed social distancing and lockdown practices.
Chappatte believes the virus in Kenya is likely under-counted. Jumia is approaching what could become a worsening COVID-19 scenario in Kenya from two angles.
“One of the ways in which we’re facing up to the crisis and trying be as useful as possible to our communities is to remain an everyday service,” he said.
“The second piece is around the right to operate…engaging the government on how home delivery can be cashless, contactless and safe and therefore a useful service over this period.”
Like many tech ventures in Africa, Jumia needs to adapt to the health and economic realities of the coronavirus to continue to generate revenues. Since going public in April 2019   and being required to report quarterly financial performance the company has faced increased pressure to demonstrate profitability.
Continued losses, a short-sell assault and an employee fraud scandal in 2019 led Jumia’s share price to plummet more than 50% since its April IPO, from  $14.50 on listing to $4.43, as of Monday.
The company weathered these events and CEO Sacha Poignonnec highlighted a bright spot in the 2019 results. Jumia finally got into the black on one key indicator, reaching a gross profit of 1.0 million after deducting fulfillment expenses in Q4 of last year.
The online retailer’s next earnings call is scheduled for May 13. It could provide a unique window into the extent COVID-19 in Africa has impacted the performance of one of the continent’s most visible tech companies."

MakeSpace, an on-demand storage company that makes it easy to order, store and retrieve your physical belongings (also providing the muscle — that is, people — to help you do it), has closed a $45 million round of equity funding led by Iron Mountain, a strategic partner (its primary focus is storage for larger businesses) that is an existing investor in the company.
The funding is notable in part because of its size, but also because of the fact that it has happened at all.
On-demand storage startups have sprung up all over the world, hopeful that their new take on an antiquated, fragmented and valuable ($38 billion annually spent on storage) market would lead to big returns in a brave, new, Uberified world. But in reality, we’ve seen a lot of ups and downs, with various startups merging, closing, transferring and trying to pivot in the process. That’s left a consolidated space with fewer, hopefully better capitalised and better organised, competitors remaining.
MakeSpace looks like it’s making a successful play to be in that group. This is a Series E for the startup — with other investors in the round including 8VC, Upfront Ventures, Maywic Select Investments, Ten Eighty, Provenio Capital, and CX Collective — and co-founder and CEO Rahul Gandhi said was at “a premium” to the valuation MakeSpace had in the last round of funding (a Series D that closed last year), without confirming either the previous or current numbers.
For some more context, PitchBook details what seems to have been a rollercoaster of valuations for the startup, which if accurate underscore some of those obvious challenges in this market. We’ll see if we can get some more clarification on that and update when and if we learn more.
MakeSpace itself has hit a number of milestones that point to its own growth. Last year, it added 20 new markets, bringing the total to 31 in North America, and doing so in a cost-effictive way. While one of the biggest costs (and stumbling blocks) for storage services to date has been grappling with building real estate businesses, MakeSpace has leaned on the infrastructure of its strategic investor Iron Mountain to bypass that challenge (and reduce those associated costs).
Gandhi said that it’s been outpacing “even our strongest forecasts,” with growth north of 30% on its targets, and he said the company has tens of thousands of customers.
And while you might assume that a lack of house moving might mean less activity for storage companies, it seems the opposite is the case: MakeSpace and others like it have been designated “essential services” and its services have been in demand for people who are looking at their living spaces — and the prospect of spending significantly more time in them doing more than just watching Netflix, eating and sleeping — with new eyes. And ditto small businesses that are moving out of premises, even temporarily, or needing to rejig their environments because of distancing rules.
What’s also notable about MakeSpace is how it organises its workforce. While many on-demand businesses today have scaled by using an army of contractors, and all the complexities that this brings into the equation with regards to employee protections and benefits, MakeSpace has hired only full-time people, using its own team and those employed by Iron Mountain.
“They can get wonderful packages and all the benefits and perks to keep employee base happy,” Gandhi said. “It makes it easier to scale up the business and in terms of the hiring capabilities to help us scale.”
He acknowledged also that while Iron Mountain is an obvious acquirer longer-term, it remains a minority investor. “It’s really key that we remain independent,” he added. “We understand the strength of what they bring to table but in order for this business to capture major market share we felt collectively it was important for it to remain that way. At some point that discussion [on a bigger stake or acquisition] may happen but for now we feel incredibly good about what they are bringing to the table.”"

Novant Health and California based UAV delivery startup Zipline have launched distribution of personal protective gear and medical equipment in North Carolina.
Novant is a non-profit healthcare provider with a network in the Southeastern United States.
Through the partnership, Zipline’s drones will make 32 mile flights on two routes between Novant Health’s emergency drone fulfillment center in Kannapolis to the company’s medical center in Huntersville, North Carolina where front line healthcare workers are treating coronavirus patients.
Zipline and Novant are touting the arrangement as the first authorized long-range drone logistics delivery flight program in the U.S. The program has gained approvals by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and North Carolina’s Department of Transportation though the FAA offered TechCrunch nuanced guidance on how it classifies the undertaking.
This story behind the Novant, Zipline UAV collaboration has a twist: the capabilities for the U.S. operation were developed primarily in Africa. Zipline has a test facility in the San Francisco area, but spent several years configuring its drone delivery model in Rwanda and Ghana.
Co-founded in 2014 by Americans Keller Rinaudo, Keenan Wyrobek and Will Hetzler, Zipline designs its own UAVs, launch and landing systems and logistics software for distribution of critical medical supplies.
The company turned to East Africa in 2016, entering a partnership with the government of Rwanda to test and deploy its drone service in that country.  Zipline went live with UAV distribution of life saving medical supplies in Rwanda in late 2016, claiming the first national drone-delivery program at scale in the world.
Zipline co-founder Keller Rinaudo (L) with Rwandan President Paul Kagame (Middle) in 2016
The company expanded to Ghana in 2016, where in addition to delivering blood and vaccines by drone, it now distributes COVID-19 related medication and lab samples.
Based on its Africa operations, Zipline was selected by regulators to participate in medical drone delivery testing in the U.S. in 2016, in coordination with the FAA.
The company’s Africa business also led to its pandemic response partnership with Novant Health. The North Carolina based company was in discussion with Zipline on UAV delivery before the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., but the crisis spurred both parties to speed things up, according to Hank Capps, a Senior Vice President at Novant.
That included some improvisation. For its current launch site the operation is using space donated by a local NASCAR competition team, Stewart-Haas Racing.
According to Capps, the current collaboration using drones to deliver medical supplies from that site could grow beyond the 32 mile route Zipline and Novant began flights on last Friday.
“Right now we plan to expand it geographically within our footprint, which is fairly large within North Carolina, South Florida, and Virginia,” he told TechCrunch on a call.
That, of course, will depend on regulatory approval. The FAA granted Novant Health permission to operate the current program which the FAA classifies as a distribution vs. delivery operation through a 107 waiver. This rolls up into the evolving federal code on operation of unmanned aircraft in the U.S. and allows Novant and Zipline to operate “until Oct. 31, 2020, or until all COVID-related restrictions on travel, business and mass gatherings for North Carolina are lifted, whichever occurs first,” according to the FAA. The U.S. regulatory body also stipulated that “Part 107 is a waiver, not a drone licence.”
The FAA offered cautious confirmation that the Zipline, Novant partnership is the first approved long range unmanned delivery service in the United States.
“I am not aware of any that are flying routes as far as what they are doing in North Carolina, but I try to be careful when talking about firsts,” an FAA spokesperson told TechCrunch.
Last month UPS and CVS announced a shorter range drone delivery program of prescription drugs to a retirement village in Florida.

The arrangement between Zipline and Novant is not for financial gain according to both parties but still supports Zipline’s profitability thesis advanced by co-founder Keller Rinaudo.
Healthcare logistics is a $70 billion global industry, and its still only serving a golden billion on the planet, he told me in a 2016 interview.
On a recent call, Rinaudo noted the startup is generating income on operations to serve that market, through the company doesn’t release financial data.
“At the distribution centers that have been operating for more than a year, Zipline is making money on the deliveries that we do,” he said.
Rinaudo pointed to the more favorable margins of autonomous delivery using small, electric powered UAVs versus large internal combustion vehicles.
“I think that these kinds of services are going to operate, much more profitably than traditional logistic services,” he said.
Zipline sold investors on that value proposition. The company has raised (a reported) $233 million in VC from backers including Andreeson Horowitz and Goldman Sachs. Zipline intends to expand its drone delivery business in the U.S. and anywhere in the world it finds demand, according to its CEO.
In addition to partners such as Novant Health, Zipline has caught the attention of big logistics providers, such as UPS which has supported (and studied) the startup’s Africa operations back to 2016.
The Zipline, Novant partnership on UAV delivery of medical supplies in the U.S. is a high-point for the thesis that Africa’s tech ecosystem which has become a hotbed for VC and startups can produce innovation with global application.
The presidents of Rwanda and Ghana  Paul Kagame and Nana Akufo-Addo were instrumental in supporting Zipline’s partnerships in their countries. Other nations on the continent, such as Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia, continue to advance commercial drone testing and novel approaches to regulating the sector.

For all the talk that COVID-19 may force an isolationist shift across countries, the Zipline, Novant Health partnership is very much a globally incubated solution applied locally in the U.S. to an international problem.
The program combines a medical drone delivery startup founded in San Francisco with a model tested in Africa to an American healthcare venture in North Carolina, with a little help from a NASCAR race team. This could reflect the unique application of tech and partnerships to come in the fight against COVID-19."

Yokohama, Japan-based WHILL has already seen a bit of traction for its autonomous mobility device in the forms of global trials in recent years, and now that the novel coronavirus has become a serious concern, at least one airport is further embracing the tech.
The startup noted this morning that Tokyos Haneda Airport will be using the WHILL Autonomous Drive System to help passengers with reduced mobility travel between gates. The implementation is still fairly limited, serving gates three through seven at the worlds fourth busiest airport. 
WHILL cites concerns over the spread of COVID-19 as a major factor in the acceleration of the adoption, following 11 trials that have served around 400 passengers since 2019. The addition of autonomous personal mobility vehicles will go some ways toward reducing contact between staff and passengers and hopeful limit the spread of the virus in the process.
In the With Corona era, we believe services that support mobility while maintaining social distancing will accelerate to replace human labor with robots and autonomous driving technologies. CEO Sathoshi Sugie said in a release. WHILL wants to provide a safe service that connects the last mile. We look forward to rapidly developing our business in order to help restore a world where people can move around with peace of mind and enjoyment.
The system operates with a simple tap of the touchscreen, navigating to the destination gate. When the passenger has arrived safely, another tap with return it to its docking station."

The mid-size SUV that ended its 30-year production run in 1996 was supposed to debut in March. Then COVID-19 happened and well everything got cancelled, including numerous vehicle reveals.
The reborn Ford Bronco will finally emerge to the media and public beyond what we’ve already seen thanks to lots of leaked photos on July 9. Ford announced the date in a post Saturday on Instagram.
Why has TechCrunch dared write about the Ford Bronco? Let’s ignore that it’s a Saturday and I’m trying to bring a little light into everyone’s lives for a fleeting moment or that the Ford Bronco was my childhood companion on numerous camping trips in Baja and the first vehicle I ever drove off road.
The Ford Bronco might be a classic. But it will certainly embody some new fangled tech, hence our interest. The Bronco is also part of Ford’s previously announced plans to invest $750 million and add 2,700 new direct jobs at its Wayne, Mich. factory. The Ford Bronco and an all-new Ford Ranger will be assembled at the Wayne factory, which will also house and a new modification center to support autonomous vehicles.
Expect Ford to produce a family of Bronco vehicles, including a smaller Bronco Sport and plug-in hybrid. Ford CEO Jim Hackett confirmed during the company’s 2019 shareholder meeting that a hybrid would be part of the mix.
The Bronco is going to be available in two- and four-door configurations. There should be lots of opportunity for buyers to customize their Bronco. For instance, opting for removable doors and roof. The expectation is that the Bronco will have a body-on-frame chassis and be offered with 2.3-liter turbo four and maybe even a V6. Although it’s unclear if the smaller Sport will have a different architecture.
Stay tuned."

As Axios first reported, the accounts of Lee Cheuk-Yan, Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo were closed down by the video communication service for planning and holding vigils and events to commemorate the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
According to Zoom’s own timeline, the company was notified by the Chinese government about four large, June 4th commemoration meetings that were being publicized on social media. The Chinese government demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts. Responding to the Chinese government’s request Zoom determined that three of the four events included participants from mainland China and were distributing information or discussing events that were illegal under Chinese law.
Zoom shut down those meetings.
The company also suspended the host accounts, which were located in Hong Kong and the U.S.
In its statement, Zoom blamed the decision on the company’s inability to block participants by country. “We could have anticipated this need,” the company acknowledged.
To correct its error, Zoom said it would be “developing technology over the next several days that will enable us to remove or block at the participant level based on geography. This will enable us to comply with requests from local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders; however we will also be able to protect these conversations for participants outside of those borders where the activity is allowed.”
Zoom attributed its decision to acquiesce to the Chinese government as a consequence of operating as an international company. “We hope that one day, governments who build barriers to disconnect their people from the world and each other will recognize that they are acting against their own interests, as well as the rights of their citizens and all humanity,” the company wrote in its statement. “The reality is Zoom operates in more than 80 countries and continues to expand, which requires compliance with local laws even as Zoom seeks to promote the open exchange of ideas.”
This isn’t the first time that Zoom’s privacy and security policies or the company’s potentially too-cozy relationship with the Chinese government has been called into question. The company also came under fire for routing some of its calls through China, something the company called a mistake, when the practice was first reported in April.
The company has previously acknowledged that much of its technology development is conducted in China and security concerns from governments abound. Taiwan and India have both banned the app for government use, and the U.S. Government and German Ministry of foreign affairs are restricting use of the app for government purposes.
Despite all of the security lapses and criticism, usage of Zoom has skyrocketed. It now counts over 300 million users of its streaming video communication services.
The company’s full statement follows below:
We hope that one day, governments who build barriers to disconnect their people from the world and each other will recognize that they are acting against their own interests, as well as the rights of their citizens and all humanity. The reality is Zoom operates in more than 80 countries and continues to expand, which requires compliance with local laws even as Zoom seeks to promote the open exchange of ideas.”
Recent articles in the media about adverse actions we took toward Lee Cheuk-yan, Wang Dan, and Zhou Fengsuo have some calling into question our commitment to being a platform for an open exchange of ideas and conversations. To be clear, their accounts have been reinstated, and going forward, we will have a new process for handling similar situations. 
We will do better as we strive to make Zoom the most secure and trusted way to bring people together.
Key Facts
<ul><li>In May and early June, we were notified by the Chinese government about four large, public June 4th commemoration meetings on Zoom that were being publicized on social media, including meeting details. The Chinese government informed us that this activity is illegal in China and demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts.</li><li>We did not provide any user information or meeting content to the Chinese government. We do not have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible.</li><li>For one of the meetings, even though the Chinese authorities demanded we take action, we chose to keep the meeting undisturbed because it did not have any participants from mainland China.</li><li>For two of the four meetings, a U.S.-based Zoom team reviewed the meeting metadata (such as IP addresses) while the meeting was in progress, and confirmed a significant number of mainland China participants.</li><li>For the fourth situation, the Chinese government showed us a social media invitation for an upcoming meeting referencing a June 4th commemoration event and demanded we take action. The Chinese authorities also notified us of a prior meeting under this account that they considered to be illegal. A U.S.-based Zoom team confirmed the attendance of mainland China participants in that prior meeting.</li><li>Zoom does not currently have the ability to remove specific participants from a meeting or block participants from a certain country from joining a meeting. As such, we made the decision to end three of the four meetings and suspended or terminated the host accounts associated with the three meetings.</li></ul>How We Fell Short
We strive to limit actions taken to only those necessary to comply with local laws. Our response should not have impacted users outside of mainland China. We made two mistakes:
<ul><li>We suspended or terminated the host accounts, one in Hong Kong SAR and two in the U.S. We have reinstated these three host accounts.</li><li>We shut down the meetings instead of blocking the participants by country. We currently do not have the capability to block participants by country. We could have anticipated this need. While there would have been significant repercussions, we also could have kept the meetings running.</li></ul>Actions Were Taking
<ul><li>Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China.</li><li>Zoom is developing technology over the next several days that will enable us to remove or block at the participant level based on geography. This will enable us to comply with requests from local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders; however, we will also be able to protect these conversations for participants outside of those borders where the activity is allowed.</li><li>We are improving our global policy to respond to these types of requests. We will outline this policy as part of our transparency report, to be published by June 30, 2020.</li></ul>In addition to connecting people for business, education, healthcare, and other professional endeavors, during this global pandemic Zoom has become the platform people all over the world are choosing for human connection. Zoom is proud of the role we are playing globally and fully supports the open exchange of ideas and conversations that bring communities together to meet, organize, collaborate, and celebrate."

The biggest surprise? It’s how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.
Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.
In fact, though you’d think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.
We can’t pinpoint when this started based on Fenwick’s report, but our guess is that it kicked off with WeWork’s pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up — and up — sometimes comes down fast, too.
What about good old-fashioned down rounds? You’d probably guess that a lot of startups — including those in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer — were impacted severely when the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. But again, Fenwick’s data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that’s even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.
It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the firm of extensions to earlier rounds. Investors don’t like seeing their deals marked down by new investors, of course. The thinking, too, is just to get the companies through this rough patch, then figure out what’s what. (Relatedly, there was a sizable increase in flat rounds: 18% in April, compared to 13% in March and 9% last year.)
More astonishing was the sheer pace of investing into startups in Silicon Valley. Though there was talk about investors needing to stop and assess the health of their portfolio companies from mid-March to early April, it seems now that VCs never really stepped off the gas. According to Fenwick, the number of deals actually increased from 54 in March to 64 in April; that nearly matches the 65 deals per month that were completed last year, when the world wasn’t grappling with an epidemic.
For what it’s worth, many of these were later-stage deals. Fenwick’s data shows the percentage of Series D and E+ deals increased to 38% of all financings in April, up from 21% in March and the highest that figure has been since August 2018, when Series D/E+ deals combined for 42% of all financings.
In short, VCs were plowing more money into what they see as sure things — and into management teams they weren’t meeting for the first time over Zoom.
Either way, as one of the reports authors — longtime attorney Barry Kramer — noted in a follow-up email, averages “can obscure” the disparities in how companies are being impacted right now, with some benefiting from the stay-work-learn-at-home shift, while others, including biotech research, manufacturing and hardware being hurt by it.
“We aren’t seeing massive upheaval or panic in the industry,” however, wrote Kramer. VCs are instead “adjusting to the current situation.”"

At the time, late-September also felt like a fairly safe bet for some return to normality.
Three months later, however, the timeline now feels overly optimistic. Today, the shows organizers announced that Computex 2020 wont be happening. Instead, the show has been rescheduled to June 2021. Thats a nicer way of saying that Computex will be missing a year, following in the footsteps of other large tech shows like Barcelona’s MWC, which was among the  first to be felled by the virus. 
A press release notes that Taiwan has largely been spared the virus. The countrys 443 confirmed cases and seven deaths are made all the more remarkable by its proximity to mainland China. Of course, a big part of containing the virus have involved travel lockdowns. Inviting some 43,000 people from around the world to attend an indoor event in your most populous city seems like a reasonably good recipe for spreading the highly contagious virus. 
The show will happen June 1-5 2021, putting it back in line with preview years events. There will also be some online programming in the meantime. Other shows, meanwhile, have announced plans to go on as planned. Notably, IFA will once again be held in Berlin in September, albeit with a mandated cap on attendance. Januarys CES, on the other hand, will go ahead as planned in Vegas."

The following month, Barcelonas MWC was ultimately shut down, as the pandemic began to move across Europe. That was the first of many dominoes to fall, as events were either taken online or canceled altogether. 
Seems CES wont miss a beat, however. The CTA (CES’s governing body) announced today that it plans to go forward with the Las Vegas event in January 2021. Unlike Berlins IFA, which is purposely scaling back attendance, CES does not appear to have planned anything like an attendance cap in the works. Though organizers note that they will continue to expand online events tied to the show, as it seems many would rather not risk the in-person event. 
The CTA also detailed the standard array of safeguards for show-goers. Those are as follows, 
<ul><li> Regularly clean and sanitize spaces across the show venues and provide sanitization stations throughout;
</li><li> Better enable social distancing, including widening aisles in many exhibit areas and providing more space between seats in conference programs and other areas where attendees congregate;
</li><li> Issue best practices for attendees, such as wearing masks and avoiding shaking hands, and for exhibitors on product demonstrations;
</li><li> Limit touch points throughout the facilities including through cashless systems for purchases and transactions;
</li><li> Evaluate solutions for contactless thermal scans at key venue entry points;
</li><li> Provide enhanced on-site access to health service and medical aid.
</li></ul>Organizers say theyre working closely with the Las Vegas community on other best practices. Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman has been particular vocal in her opposition to COVID-related shutdowns. She referred to safety measures as “total insanity in mid-April and offered to make her city a control group by opening casinos and other businesses up to domestic and international travelers. 
Many event planners, on the other hand, continue to be cautious as fears of additional COVID-19 waves spread across the globe. Given how notorious these conventions are when it comes to the spread of colds and flus in non-pandemic years, it seems safe to assume that many regular attendees will opt to sit this one out. Notably, the CTA is using the “plan” here. It’s hard enough to imagine what the world is going to look like tomorrow, let alone seven months from now."

His worries only grew when COVID-19 led to school shutdowns and kids came home to a world of remote learning. Now, as lockdowns extend, Ringelstein is learning to embrace screen time as a way to sneak education and entertainment into his kids digital diet.
Ringelstein, the former founder of UClass (acquired in 2015), launched Zigazoo, which he describes as a TikTok for kids.
Zigazoo is a free app where kids can answer short video-based exercises that they can answer through video and share responses with friends. Exercises range from how to create a baking soda volcano to making fractions out of food, and targets kids from preschool to middle school.
To ensure the apps privacy, Ringelstein says that parents should be the primary users of the app. Users have to accept a friend request in order for their content to be seen, a move Ringelstein sees as key to avoiding bad actors or potential bullying.
Additionally, Zigazoo uses an API to moderate content.
Ringelsteins first users were his own kids, a test he says was very rewarding.
Ringelstein’s son participating in a Zigazoo prompt.
The testing process made him realize that kids like to create longer videos, and watch smaller videos, so Zigazoo is figuring out an attention span for viewing. Currently, average time on site per user has gone up to 19 minutes and 43 seconds per day.
Ringelstein pointed to “Sesame Street” as his inspiration. Mixing education and entertainment has proven successful for a number of businesses. Kids were drooling in front of the screen watching the characters of “Sesame Street,” spending mindless hours staring at the television set, he recalls.
The creators of Sesame Street…used the medium to educate kids and entertain them at the same time, Ringelstein said. Vox described “Sesame Street” as a bedrock for educational television, bringing loved characters to the table with former First Lady Michelle Obama or using a silly song to teach kids about recycling.
In one month, Zigazoo has had 100,000 videos uploaded to and downloaded from its site.
While Zigazoo claims to be a “TikTok” for kids, it is competing with the platform itself. Some teachers have turned to TikTok to create lessons on solar cell systems and experiments.
Others are putting together guides of kid friendly TikTok creators. And TikTok itself recently let parents set restrictions on content, DMs and screen time for their kids.
Video-based learning is a better way for students to engage actively in an educational activity, versus passively reading a paragraph from a Google doc, according to Ringelstein.
Combining education with entertainment comes with a set of risks around child safety. Last March, The New York Times wrote a story about how “kidfluencers” has grown as a concept, where parents put their kids online, touting brands, and make money off of it. The resulting ethical concerns are why Ringelstein is confident that Zigazoo is needed.
Zigazoo is a not a kid play date smack dab in the middle of an adult party like YouTube and TikTok, it is a universe tailor-made for kid safety, learning and enjoyment, he said.
Ringelstein sees Zigazoos friend versus follow feature as key to the safety of kids: Unlike TikTok, where there is a public feed and users can follow everyone, Zigazoo requires users to opt-in to being followed, similar to Facebook.
The partnerships will allow Zigazoo to post verified content using favorite and well-known characters to teach kids about the subjects they care about. And in a world where digital detoxes are no longer a reality, a smarter screen-time activity seems much needed.
Recently, Zigazoo partnered with The American Federation of Teachers for a capstone project directed at millions of K-12 students. Students are invited to submit a video using Zigazoo to encapsulate their learning experience over the past school year, which AFT says is a far better way to sum up learning than a high-stakes test.
This summer Ringelstein is launching “Zigazoo Channels” with a select group of major children’s entertainment companies, podcasts, museums, libraries, zoos, social media influencers and more."

In the company’s quarterly earnings release, Zoom delivered a beat that represented 169% year-over-year revenue growth, but they did so on the back of huge customer growth. The company detailed that they now had 265,400 customers with more than 10 users on their account, a number Zoom said represented a 354% surge. Zoom also saw a big spike in high-budget customers who had spent more than $100K on the platform in the past year, noting these customers had grown 90% since Q1 of last year.
One thing we didn’t get was an update on total daily active or monthly active users on the platform.
In April, the company garnered ire for offering up misleading figures claiming the service had 300 million daily active users. Zoom later corrected the error, noting that these were not DAUs and were merely daily active participants, a distinction which highlights that users in multiple meetings per day were likely counted multiple times inside this metric.
The company’s massive influx of enterprise users is hardly surprising as more companies have leaned on services like Zoom to ease their transition to remote work among shelter-in-place related office shutdowns.
“The COVID-19 crisis has driven higher demand for distributed, face-to-face interactions and collaboration using Zoom. Use cases have grown rapidly as people integrated Zoom into their work, learning, and personal lives, Zoom’s CEO Eric Yuan said in a statement accompanying the release."

The next show will take place April 2 to April 11, 2021. Press days will be March 31 and April 1.
The New York Auto Show, which is organized by the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, was scheduled to begin April 10 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. The event was rescheduled for late August after COVID-19 swept into Europe and North America.
The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the traditional location for the show, was set up as a field hospital for COVID-19 cases. The center doesn’t have any patients. However, it is still set up as an active hospital and is in standby mode for the foreseeable future, according to organizers.
Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, noted that “immense planning” is needed for automakers and their exhibit partners to construct a show.
“Because of the uncertainty caused by the virus, we feel it would not be prudent to continue with the 2020 Show and instead are preparing for an even greater 2021,” Schienberg said.
“As representatives of automobile retailers, we know when this crisis passes there will be enormous pent-up demand for new vehicles in this region and across the country,” he added. “We also know how important the Show is for consumers navigating the process.”"

Boulder Care was founded by Stephanie Papes, a former associate at Apple Tree Partners. She first became interested in opioid treatment after facilitating the firm’s financing round with an organization called CleanSlate Addiction Centers, which focused on in-person treatment for opioid and alcohol addiction.
There are several options when it comes to opioid addiction treatment. A common one is replacement therapy via methadone, an opioid, which relieves the symptoms of withdrawal while blocking the high that comes from use of heroine and other narcotic pain relievers. There’s also in-patient treatment, which usually comes with strict rules around the use of drugs and sometimes even legal addictive substances like nicotine, with a very low tolerance policy for relapses.
In-patient treatment is usually expensive and not often covered by insurance, and asks patients to go cold turkey. Methadone, on the other hand, requires patients to come to a clinic at least once every day. Not only does that make it difficult to live a normal life, but these clinics are often targeted by drug dealers to poach clients.
Boulder Care looks at a different approach that uses a combination of telehealth services and a prescription drug called Buprenorphine (brand name: Suboxone).
Alongside a greater risk of contracting COVID-19, and having a more severe experience of the disease than those without addiction, addicts are also at a greater risk of overdose or continued use of opioids due to social distancing and increased anxiety and stress, two huge contributing factors to addiction, according to an article published by Harvard.
Boulder Care uses telehealth to offer patients a comprehensive recovery plan, including clinician support (for medical and medication needs), a peer coach (who has lived experience with addiction and can help talk through challenges and issues) and a care advocate (who helps with administrative needs around care and insurance coverage).
“It’s not 100% abstinence only right away,” said Papes. “It’s a journey, and every incremental step and savings for the health system is good for the individual. The work that we do, just by building that trust with our participants, telling them ‘we value you, whether or not you’re using substances, and we’re not going to kick you out of the program for having an unexpected test result on your on your drug test or telling us that you use methamphetamine.’ There are a lot of policies in some of these programs that just continue to put people in harm’s way. So residential facilities will say you can’t be here for your heroin addiction if you’re smoking cigarettes, and they’ll truly discharge you from the program if you smoke. It’s not beneficial for anyone. So, we have this clinical philosophy, it’s really important, and it’s all about unconditional support.”
One of the big challenges for Boulder Care and opioid treatment organizations across the country is the regulatory limits on prescribing Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist, which means it produces euphoric effects and respiratory depression at low to moderate doses. However, these effects are much weaker than a full opioid agonist like heroine or methadone.
Buprenorphine also greatly weakens the effects of withdrawal, allowing patients to try and stabilize their life and achieve a healthier lifestyle.
Unlike methodone, Buprenorphine can be prescribed by a doctor for use at home, rather than making a trip to a clinic, where patients must be examined and drug tested before they can take their dose. However, there are regulatory limits on doctors around the number of people they can prescribe Buprenorphine to in a given time period, and doctors must also pay to get training and a license to prescribe the drug.
According to Papes, this means 80 percent of the country who could benefit from a Buprenorphine prescription can’t get it. In fact, a HuffPost analysis showed that even if all the doctors who are licensed to prescribe Buprenorphine did so at the maximum rate in 2012, more than half of Americans suffering from opioid addiction still couldn’t get access to the drug.
Part of the reason that prescribing Buprenorphine has such strict limitations comes down to stigma, with many believing in the long-held misconception that replacing one drug for another isn’t the answer, and that abstinence is simply a challenge of mental willpower, negating the fact that addiction is a disease.
There’s no doubt about the potential efficacy of Buprenorphine. In 1995, France allowed any doctor to prescribe Buprenorphine without special licensing or training. About 10x the number of addicted patients began receiving medication-assisted treatments, cutting overdoses by nearly 80 percent in four years, according to the Atlantic.
Another requirement around the prescription of Buprenorphine is that the patient had to have at least one in-person visit with the doctor before they could get access to the medication.
That visit could be someone coming into a clinic or facility seeking to change their own life proactively. It could also be at the emergency room when someone is brought in for an overdose.
“It’s very challenging when someone has a tiny window in which they’re feeling like they’re ready for change, and you have to coordinate with another facility in order to get them into your care,” explained Papes.
During this national health emergency, that requirement has been waived, allowing for doctors to prescribe this medication without an in-person meeting with the patient. This is a huge boost for Boulder Care, which runs its business entirely via telehealth.
Since the start of March 2020, the company has seen 130% week-over-week increase in weekly inquiries from potential patients, and new patient enrollments is up 32%. During COVID-19, any patient who is uninsured or under-insured can get services from Boulder for free.
Boulder recently partnered with Premera Blue Cross, an insurance plan in the Pacific Northwest, to provide zero cost share options for virtual substance use disorder treatment, which will give 2.3 million customers access to Boulder Care through at least June 30. Cost shares will be waived for all patients seeking medically necessary telehealth treatment.
Alongside revamping the way patients receive treatment for substance use disorders, Boulder is also looking to change the payment model. Traditionally, the healthcare system remunerates providers based on admissions (and often, readmissions) without focusing on outcomes. Meanwhile, outpatient fee-for-service reimburses for clinical visits and drug-testing, rather than peer recovery coaching, 24/7 text messaging and same-day access, a few of the things that contribute to successful outcomes outside of clinical treatment.
Boulder partners with paying entities for ‘bundled’ services, charging a flat rate per patient without focusing on the volume of procedures. The hope, according to Papes, is to “realign incentives and tie payment to accountability for meaningful outcomes.”
Boulder Care has raised more than $10 million with investment from Tusk Venture Partners, who led the Series A, among others."

Personally, music has been a lifesaver throughout the lockdowns and some personal struggles. Without streaming services and vinyl, I dread to imagine what state my already fragile psyche might be in. For that reason, Bandcamps monthly day of waived fees has been an important opportunity to give back to musicians who have given me so much, but continue to struggle as touring the primary source of income for many has ground to a halt.

This month, things are a big different. In addition to Bandcamp waiving its share of sales, a long list of artists are using their own cut to donate to important issues. Once again, its a long list, which can be found here.
Many are donating proceeds to the National Bail Fund Network, as police round up often peaceful protestors. Other highlighted organizations included the NAACP and Reclaim the Block. The NAACP will get another bump from the service on June 19, when Bandcamp donates its cut of sales directly to the organization. 
Throughout the pandemic, Bandcamps monthly artist days have brought in more sales than any other in the services history. Thats made even more remarkable as jobless claims have soared to 40 million. COVID-19 has had an otherwise historically debilitating impact on the music industry. In March, music sales suffered their worst week in 60 years. 
The days have been a lifeline for many artists, as has Bandcamp in general. Check out Pitchforks recent breakdown of artist revenues on the site versus other streaming services, which tend to deemphasize artist payouts, to the say the least.

The latter category of tools has seen quickening demand as the world moves to support newly remote workforces, helping keep them both productive and secure.
TechCrunch has covered the accelerating digital transformation — industry slang for companies moving to a more software-and-cloud world — before, noting that investors are making big bets on companies that might benefit from its ramping pace. Thanks to new data from a Twilio-led survey, we have a fresh look at that trend.
Undergirding the digital transformation is how today’s workers are adapting to remote work. If many workers don’t want to stop working from home, the gains that companies serving the digital transformation are seeing could prove permanent. New data from a Qualtrics -led survey may help us understand the new mindset of the domestic, and global worker.
At the union of the two datasets is a lens into the future of not only how many information workers, to borrow an old phrase, will labor in the future, but how they’ll feel about it. So, this morning let’s explore the world through two data-driven lenses, helped as we go with notes from interviews with Qualtrics’ CEO Ryan Smith and Twilio’s Chief Customer Officer, Glenn Weinstein."

The second best possible time, however, is right now. When the COVID-19 pandemic really started hitting the global community in earnest, there was a run on these once fairly niche products from companies with names like PhoneSoap. 
In fact, available models started selling out all over the place, when many people began to recognize for the first time just how much of a disease vector the smartphone could truly be. All of that in mind, the category is a pretty logical next step for the many accessory brands underneath the Zagg umbrella.
Today Mophie and InvisibleShield launched their takes on the category. The products are priced at $80 and $60, respectively, with the key differentiator here being the inclusion of a 10W wireless charging pad. Though thats actually on the lid of the product. Meaning you can use it to charge the handset only once its out of the disinfecting bed.
Both sanitize phones up to 6.9 inches, using UV-C light, promising to kill up to 99.9% of bacteria. Its certainly worth noting that, like PhoneSoap, these brands are not making claims that their products can kill the novel coronavirus. The jury is still out on their efficacy on that front. In fact, COVID-19 is conspicuously absent from the press material. And even with one of these, Id still strongly recommend carrying around a pack of antibacterial wipes, if you can still find any. 
Both products are available now, through their respective sites."

Case in point: Summit Partners, a venerable investor at the growth stage for startups and focused on the ecosystems in North America and Europe, has raised two new megafunds. The firm also announced that it has hired Melanie Whelan, who formerly was CEO of SoulCycle, as a new managing director. She is currently an EIR at the firm.
Summit raised a $1 billion growth equity fund focused on North American startups, and also raised a 1.1 billion ($1.24 billion) fund focused on European startups. The firm said that the funds will target growth equity-style investments with a check size of between roughy $10 million and $60 million for North American startups, and a bit larger for their European counterparts.
In recent months, the firm has invested in companies like cyber security platform RiskIQ, workflow automation startup AppWay, interaction management service Podium, consumer bedding brand Brooklinen, and cyber-skills platform Immersive Labs, according to Crunchbase.
While Summit is traditionally known for its enterprise investments, it appears the firm wants to double down on consumer with the hiring of Whelan. She will focus on high-growth consumer and technology-enabled services, according to Summit.
Whelan had a long career at SoulCycle, joining the company as COO in 2012 and then took the CEO title in 2015. There, she drove market expansion and worked to ready the somewhat cultish fitness brand for the public markets, with an IPO that was scheduled in mid-2018. That IPO ended up being pulled by the company, which faced headwinds from Peloton and other fitness upstarts, and Whelan left the CEO job near the end of 2019 (which, given the near complete shutdown of in-person fitness studios, seems incredibly fortuitously timed). She officially joined Summit as an EIR in February, right before the spread of the novel coronavirus slowed down much of the venture world.
The firm today has 100 people scattered across its myriad of offices, and has $21 billion under management."

These concerns were illustrated last week, when AMC CEO Adam Aron said in an interview that the theater chain would not be requiring that patrons wear masks except in locations where they’re legally required to do so because the company “did not want to be drawn into a political controversy.” Naturally, those comments prompted a controversy of their own, leading AMC to reverse its decision.
So it makes sense for NBCUniversal-owned movie ticketing app Fandango to highlight the different safety measures that theaters are taking.
It’s useful from an informational perspective, so that moviegoers understand and prepare for the experience in theaters, and perhaps choose theaters based on how serious they seem about safety. But it’s also a savvy marketing move, as those theaters will need to convince moviegoers that it’s safe to return.

The new features include what Fandango is pitching as a “one-stop shop” to view the safety measures announced by more than 100 theater chains, with information about auditorium occupancy, social distance seating, mask/protective equipment policies, enhanced cleaning measures and special concession arrangements. There will also be instructional videos, social distance seating maps and a way to search for reopened theaters by location.
Since movie theaters have been closed for the past few months, Fandango also says it will be extending expired rewards from its Fandango VIP+ loyalty programs for another 60 days.
We are working closely with our friends in exhibition to help get their ticketing back online and film fans back in seats with peace of mind, said Melissa Heller, Fandangos vice president of domestic ticketing, in a statement. In addition to our new product features, Fandangos mobile ticketing will be an added benefit, helping moviegoers and cinema employees reduce the number of contact points at the box office and throughout the theater."

The dashboard combines data collected by Earth observation satellites operated by each of the agencies, which monitor photographic, air quality, temperature, climate and other indicators.
The COVID-19 Earth Observation Data provides views into changes globally in water quality, climate change, economic activity and also agriculture. It’s intended to provide policymakers, health authorities, city planners and others with key information that they can use to study both short- and long-term impacts of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis, which is definitely changing the way that cities and the people within them work and live.
The agencies involved in the project formed a project for the purposes of building this in April, so it came together rather quickly for a cross-agency, international collaboration. Data so far indicates significant changes, including positive environmental ones around air and water quality due to decreased activity but also significant slowdowns in key economic activity including shipping activity in ports, the number of cars in shopping mall parking lots, and more.
While the project is specifically intended to provide data around COVID-19 and its impacts, and the current plan only includes the pandemic within its scope, on a call discussing the initiative, ESA Director of Earth Observation Programmes Josef Aschbacher said that the agencies are already considering whether to extend he dashboard beyond the scope of COVID-19 since it could be useful in addressing any number of global-scale problems that we collectively face."

Today, a startup that was an early mover on the opportunity of that model is announcing some news to double down on the concept.
Andela, the New York startup that helps tech companies build remote engineering teams while at the same time shrinking the digital divide by tapping talent out of hubs in Africa for those teams, is today announcing a big step up in its efforts. The company is itself going fully remote, and as part of that it’s widening the pool of people that it taps to work and train by extending its reach across the whole of the African continent, while also shutting down its existing physical campuses.
Jeremy Johnson, the co-founder and CEO, said that he believes that the move will extend the talent pool that it can tap to more than 500,000 engineers from the 250,000 that it could reach through its earlier model. To date some 100,000 engineers have applied to and used Andela’s skills training tools (it works in partnership with a number of other tech companies to provide these, including Google, Microsoft and Facebook) and it has connected some 1,000 people to job opportunities.
The news comes on the heels of the company laying off 135 employees in May, with senior employees taking 10%-30% pay-cuts ahead of what the company hinted would be a big change in its business — the news that’s getting announced today. Andela has confirmed that it is not making any more cuts to its staff with today’s news. (It has around 1,200 employees globally.)
We’re seeing a huge shift right now to remote working due to the persistent existence of COVID-19 and the need to keep more social distancing in place, and a byproduct of that has been people actively moving out of expensive tech hubs now that it’s been accepted that being in them isn’t a fundamental requirement to do work.
At the same time, a lot of companies have either slowed down or frozen hiring of full-time employees but are continuing to tap people for project-based work because their businesses are no less in need of talent to operate.
Both of those trends are an endorsement of the model that Andela helped to pioneer with its remote teams concept, and they more pointedly spell opportunity for companies like it that already have networks in place to speak to those demands.
All the same, it’s a major shift for the startup, not least because it’s closing down its physical campuses.
Founded in 2014 out of Lagos, Nigeria, and backed by investors like Generation (Al Gore’s fund), the Omidyar Network, Spark Capital and Chan Zuckerberg Education and valued at $700 million as of its most recent funding round last year, Andela has for the last six years focused on building a network based around the biggest tech hubs on the continent, building physical spaces in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda, that helped source, vet and further train talent to become part of remote company teams for some 200 customers, with a large proportion of those in the US, including Cloudflare, Wellio, ViacomCBS, and Women Who Code.
As Andela started to scale that model, starting with a pilot in Ghana in 2018 and a second in Egypt last year, it saw that the more efficient route was to forego the physical hubs completely for virtual ones.
Indeed, Jeremy Johnson, the CEO who co-founded the company with Christina Sass, said that its move was not a direct response to the pandemic per se, although global events have definitely given a fillip to the concept. 
“What weve done historically is go and build campus in each location and in early days that made a ton of sense because that was helpful for training and from an infrastructure standpoint it was what we needed to do,” he said in an interview.
“But as weve transitioned to focus more on the breadth and depth of talent and diversity across the continent, we opened satellites in Egypt and Ghana where we didnt require a campus. Its actually worked really well and some ways feels like its opening opportunities for even greater growth.”
Our own interview was via Zoom, with me in London and Johnson in New Hampshire: Andela’s New York office (where he is normally based) closed for the moment.
“Our headquarters has technically been the internet, but weve had a big presence in NYC,” he said referring to its US base. He added that the expansion in Africa using the satellite/remote concept is the limit to how it apply the remote concept, with the question of what will happen in the future to even its US offices still not fully answered.
“We announced a few weeks ago we are going to be a remote-first company overall going forward,” he said. “It lets you think differently about where to live and more. I don’t know what it means longer term but for now we are all living on Zoom.”
While Andela is obviously expanding its talent pool with this move, and potentially giving a huge boost to providing more job opportunities for technology talent on the continent, the interesting next step for all of us will be to see how that connects with the other side of the marketplace — that is, the big tech companies themselves and how much they need to and are willing to invest in growing their own workforces. That is not a minor issue, considering the millions that have been laid off so far in the last few months.
Andela, Johnson said, has no plans to raise more capital at the moment with money in the bank and revenues continuing to come in. Last year, it confirmed that it was on an annual revenue run rate of $50 million, but it’s not updating that figure at the moment."

Astra has just completed a second static test fire of its Rocket 3.1 orbital launch vehicle, and that means it’s now ready for a trip to Alaska where it’ll hopefully make its first trip to orbit from a spaceport in Kodiak.
Astra originally started out as a company with the specific goal of answering the DARPA launch challenge, which asked companies to create a launch vehicle that could tech orbit within a few weeks of each other (originally from separate launch sites, but then later only from separate pads at the same spaceport). The challenge expired without Astra claiming the price, after the 3.0 version of their Rocket failed to reach orbit.
The company has developed, tested and flown three successive generations of Rocket, mostly without much in the way of public fanfare or information sharing. The startup builds its small rockets, which measure roughly 40-feet tall, in Alameda, California at their own factory. In an interview with TechCrunch ahead of their DARPA challenge attempt, Astra CEO and founder Chris Kemp explained that their approach is focused on rapid, at-scale manufacturing and potential failure margins that might be higher than the existing launch companies tolerate.
A kind of mass-market delivery system approach definitely has advantages, and Astra has focused on a launch system that’s much more portable than others for deployment almost anywhere in the world. The company is also focused on small payloads, which it can deliver responsively, so a loss of such a spacecraft wouldn’t be nearly as expensive as, say, a rocket failing and losing a large geosynchronous GPS satellite.
Rocket 3.1 sounds like a relatively minor iteration on Rocket 3.0, vs the large full point updates of prior generations. Astra says it’s currently headed to Kodiak, and that the company is now working to finalize a launch window, with a date to be confirmed for that next big test early next week."

“Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,” House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline said. “In the wake of COVID-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.”
The argument that tech stands to benefit from the COVID-19 crisis is a smart one and a timely attack that’s difficult to dispute. While many major companies in other industries are struggling, grappling with layoffs or filing for bankruptcy, many of tech’s largest tech companies stand to emerge from the economic storm largely unscathed if not better off.
In his own opening remarks, ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner also argued that because Americans are relying more on online companies than ever before, tech’s power must be examined in light of the pandemic.
“That responsibility comes with increased scrutiny of your dominance in the market,” Sensenbrenner said.
It’s not the first warning about tech companies amassing more power in the throes of the coronavirus crisis. A handful of members of Congress have called attention to mergers planned during the pandemic, citing concerns about adequate scrutiny for deals that could make tech’s already huge companies even larger and more dominant.
In April, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) proposed the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act which would freeze mergers during the crisis, calling out big tech specifically. The LEAST we should do is halt big mergers during COVID to slow the consolidation of sectors, Ocasio-Cortez said.
Cicilline also previously called for a freeze on “mega-mergers” and pushed for such a ban to be included in the economic stimulus package passed by Congress.
“As hard as it is to believe, it is possible that our economy will emerge from this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated than before,” Cicilline said. “As American families shift more of their work, shopping, and communication online, these giants stand to profit.”"

And until today, the shows governing body, the CTA, was planning to keep its record unbroken. Today, however, CEO Gary Shapiro announced via video that the Las Vegas event has been canceled. Instead, CES 2021 will follow the lead of the rest of the industry as an online-only event.
The news won’t come as a surprise to anyone following the industry. Even January 2021 seems like an extremely optimistic timeline, social distancing measures or no. While Berlin’s IFA still plans to go forward this year, all other big tech shows have been canceled or gone all digital for the foreseeable future.
“We concluded it is simply not possible to safely gather over 100,000 people indoors with a raging COVID-19 virus and no real hope for a tested and widely available vaccine by January,” Shapiro writes in a post on LinkedIn. “The world does not need more COVID-19 cases, and we decided we would do our part by ensuring we are not helping spread the disease.”
In addition to hosting a huge number of people in an indoor venue, the international nature of the event makes it a prime vector for the continued spread of COVID-19. Not to mention the fact that the United States continues to lead the world in cases, by far.
Anecdotally, I’ve spoken to a number of regular attendees, and there remains a general sense of discomfort around the idea of attending a show like this. And to put it more crassly, becoming a potential hotbed for the spreading of this seemingly endless pandemic would be a major black eye for the organization. Canceling the show is the right move here.
And certainly the CTA is well positioned to help foster the continued popularization of online-only events. The organization has the connections and the eyeballs of the world when it comes to serving as a platform for industry news and product launches.
“[W]e commit to producing the best possible global digital innovation event,” Shapiro writes. “We will spread the gospel of 5G, artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and new forms of mobility, digital and telehealth, resilience, robotics, drones, new forms of entertainment, 8K Ultra HD screens and smart TVs to the curious, entrepreneurs, investors, business and media who can access the best of CES from their homes and offices.”
Of course, pulling off a show of this size will be tricky. Here at TechCrunch, we certainly understand the steepness of the learning curve when it comes to transitioning to digital events. Perhaps most difficult of all for the organization will be maintaining the the presence of larger companies, many of whom have already eyed their own events to make announcements.
E3 2020 is certainly a bit of a cautionary tale. This year’s event was set to be a big one with the upcoming launch of two major consoles. Both Sony and Microsoft have opted to use their own events to make product announcements for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, respectively. Notably, Samsung also announced its own launch event after officially pulling out of IFA over safety concerns."

The company’s revenue fell compared to both the year-ago quarter (Q2 2019), and the sequentially-preceding period (Q1 2020). Investors had anticipated Uber’s declines due to COVID-19, and the company had spent time earlier this year assuring the investing public that it had enough cash to get through 2020 no matter what.
In the second quarter, Uber saw gross bookings of $10.2 billion, off 35% compared to the year-ago period. This resulted in revenue of $2.24 billion, down 29% from a year-ago result of $3.17 billion. Uber’s net loss was $1.78 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down from a year-ago net loss of $5.24 billion. The company went public last year, resulting in various one-time, non-cash costs.
The company’s net loss worked out to a loss of $1.02 per share, ahead of an analyst-expected $0.86 per-share deficit. Uber missed on profitability in the quarter, but did surpass street expectations on top line, posting more revenue than the $2.18 billion figure investors expected.
Shares of Uber are off a little more than 4% in after-hours trading, following its earnings report.
A Q1 retrospective
Let’s take a look at how the financials stack up compared to the first quarter of 2020. In short: Not well.
In Q2 2020, Uber reported a Q1 per-share loss of $1.70 on revenues of $3.54 billion. The company lost $2.94 billion in the quarter counting all costs. As noted above, Uber’s per-share loss fell to $1.02, while its revenue slipped to $2.24 billion; Uber’s top line therefore dipped 36.7% compared to the first quarter.
Digging deeper, Uber generated $737 million in ride-hailing trips in the second quarter, compared to $1.66 billion in the first three-month period of this year. Gross bookings were also down more than 35% from $15.78 billion in the first quarter compared to the second.
There was some rosier news buried in this blizzard of numbers. Uber’s freight and Eats (which is now called delivery) businesses lost money, although those losses narrowed from Q1 to Q2.
Uber reported that adjusted EBITDA on its “delivery” segment narrowed to a $232 million loss in the second quarter compared to a larger $313 million loss in the first period of the year. Uber Freight adjusted EBITDA was a $49 million loss in Q2, smaller than the $64 million loss reported in Q1.
A changing business
Uber’s quarter was a period of change. Compared to the year-ago quarter, the company’s Delivery business (formerly its Uber Eats segment) saw its adjusted net revenue soar 162% compared to the year-ago quarter. At the same time, its larger Mobility segment (previously its Rides business) saw its adjusted net revenue fall 66% compared to to Q2 2019.
Uber’s ride-hailing business fell sharply as folks stayed home, while those same folks ordered lots of more food. The bookings mix-shift to food delivery did help Uber staunch ride-hailing losses, but not completely.
Ride-hailing, once a key driver of profitability at the company, only generated $50 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q2, a heavily-amended profit metric. That figure was off by $465 million compared to the year-ago period, and off $531 million compared to Q1 2020.
“Our mobility recovery is clearly dependent on the public health situation in any given area,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during the Q2 earnings call. “Asia and India is in the recovery. We’ve seen gross bookings in Hong Kong and New Zealand at times exceed pre-COVID highs and European trends have also been encouraging.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. recovery is lagging. The company’s global geographic footprint remains a huge advantage, Khosrowshahi noted. He added that once cities do reopen, trips bounce back sharply.
While ride-hailing lost ground, the rising revenue footprint of Uber’s Delivery business posted slimmer losses than in the year-ago and sequentially-preceding quarter. With an adjusted EBITDA loss of $232 million in Q2 2020, the company shaved off more than $50 million in losses compared to its year-ago adjusted EBITDA loss of $286 million; in Q1 2020 Delivery posted adjusted losses of $313 million.
Naturally those declines are largely outside of Uber’s control, but they do show the sharp impact that the global pandemic and ensuing shuttering of many economies had on the 2019 IPO.
Uber closed the period with cash (cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) of $7.8 billion. That figure was $9.0 billion at the end of its first quarter."

TechCrunch wanted to dig more deeply into the cohort of startups that are seeing acceleration, so we put together a list of investors who have put money to work in startups building remote-work tooling and sent them a raft of questions. We wanted to better understand if SaaS fatigue is real for the startups in question, where open-space still exists in the remote-work world and how the economics of the companies compare to other software shops.
And, yes, we did ask about valuations and intra-venture competition for the rounds that we keep hearing about. 
Not every deal from these venture capitalists fits the remote-work mold, but they and their firms and funds are involved with enough in our view to give them good perspective about whats going on in the space as the world continues to get into shape regarding remote work. This weeks news from Google makes it plain that tech companies are prepping for a long run of forced remote work, let alone the more hybrid remote-and-office future that seems to be the new conventional expectation.
A lasting COVID-driven remote-work boom is predicated on remote-work services not only meeting the moment, but iterating to support a world that just got pushed into a faster digital transformation than anyone expected. Its a busy space for good reason.
Heres who TechCrunch collected notes from this time around:
As usual, were going to riff over some key trends and themes that stood out from the groups collected answers, after which we’ll share their answers at length, edited for clarity and formatting.
Trends, themes
Picking through the answers we received, one thing that stood out was the simple fact that VCs do not believe that the remote-work services and tooling world is solved. In fact, the group was not shy of suggesting areas where theres still more work to be done.
As you might expect, the issue of security came up a few times. Processes are being digitized across workplace verticals but there’s plenty of room for improvement in bringing security and compliance standards into the remote-work age. 
“All the security [and] compliance while being remote is still largely untapped as companies are figuring out the answer,” said Techstars’ Cazalot, to pick one quote from a few.
Other items that popped up include front-of-office collaboration and personal remote process automation. Once basic communications are sorted, the sorts of tools and services that folks-at-a-distance need to work well both alone and and as a team will be varied.
It would be simple to presume that a growing library of apps and services would lead to software (SaaS) fatigue, but our VC group isnt too worried about the concept.
Then there was the talk concerning economics and fundraising. TechCrunch wanted to know if remote-work startups have better or worse economics than other startups that are delivered along similar channels (SaaS, etc.). Our summary of answers it that their economics are at least as good, with some exceptions that their performance could in fact be better than other groupings of their business-model peers.
Regardless, the wave of companies hunting up new apps and services to fuel and empower their suddenly remote workforce is driving venture interest in the companies welcoming the demand. But notable is that prices, per our collected investors, are not as wild as you might think. Bessemers Robinson said prices were not low (“growth equity investors are paying high multiples to get a shot at the category defining [remote work-focused] app companies”), but most others offered some more tempered notes.
Reading their answers, it appears that the further an investor is from the Silicon Valley startup hub, the more reasonable prices look; that was likely true before the pandemic, mind, but that the pattern is holding up during COVID-19 implies that there is available price arbitrage available in the market that persists even into this hot niche.
Thats our first read, but theres a lot more below.
Minn Kim, investor, Bloomberg Beta
Its now common knowledge that the digital transformation has been accelerated by COVID-19. What portion of your active portfolio benefits from this change in pace?
Given our firms focus on the future of work, weve observed that a little over half of our portfolio companies have benefited from the digital transformation accelerated by COVID-19. These have been in areas like digital productivity, security, developer collaboration tools, network infrastructure and online education. This is also because several of our portfolio companies were built with a remote workforce in mind, including coaching platformSounding Board and team success softwareRange.  
Will the influx of single-purpose remote-work apps and services lead to app fatigue, and thus a return of more bundled solutions?
For those of us fortunate enough to do most of our work online, the rise of single-purpose remote-work apps reflects the limitations of the tools that we relied on in our previous work stack. If there is new bundling, I believe we may see it on platforms were newly relying on heavily, such as those offering great ways to run online sprints, remote offsites, and collaborative screen sharing.  
Is there an upper limit to the number of tools that a single company may want to buy? Put another way, is SaaS fatigue real?
An upper limit for tool purchasing is more likely indication that a product is not yet hitting on the most important priority for its customer at the right time or price. SaaS fatigue is real until a solution comes along that addresses the users pain point in a clear, compelling and differentiated way. 
As companies begin to go back to the office, do you think they are going to trend back toward their old processes and ditch some of their new remote software?
For knowledge work, I believe some behaviors will naturally default back to old processes, such as in-person water cooler conversations in a shared common space. Even when companies begin to go back to the office, I imagine some people on our teams will continue to be remote, at least for awhile. With this in mind, I foresee an ongoing reliance on tools likePinpoint, for helping software engineers collaborate more efficiently, andBonusly, for ongoing encouragement and recognition to team members (in-person and remote).
Are there areas inside of the world of remote tools and services that you think are under-served, places where youd like to place a bet?
Id love to see more founders building solutions around lightweight automations (personal RPA), software for better decision-making and products that use digital nudges to make unstructured collaboration more effective, such as gesture recognition or sentiment notifications in video conversations. There are also many opportunities to build useful products that use the metadata in our online interactions to help us become more effective teammates. For example, were investors in a company calledCultivate that analyzes a teams digital conversations to help leaders improve and get notified when theyre sending too many emails during evening hours or sharing recognition unevenly across a team. 
Does the availability of ample private capital give remote-tooling startups the flexibility to put off going up-market to the mid-market and enterprise areas?
Its less about the flexibility of delaying moving up-market. Its more about the freedom to experiment, iterate and get a product closer to product-market-fit with its earliest representative customer segment. 
Do remote-tooling-focused startups have similar, better or worse economics than the average venture-backed SaaS startup?
This answer will vary depending on what youre comparing. Because many of the newer remote-tooling-focused companies offer freemium business models to encourage new users, the sustainability of a company comes down to the cost to serve each new customer. Weve seen that remote-tooling-focused startups that are laser-focused on a specific use case and narrow the pool of potential early customers are often in a better position to understand their unit economics. 
How competitive are remote-work tooling venture rounds now? Are prices out of control?
It feels like the right time to build and raise for a Zoom competitor was at the beginning of 2020. Now, were seeing competitive rounds for companies building on top of Zoom or around workflow-specific features, such as event and community management or meeting analytics. That said, prices at the pre-seed and seed stages havent changed dramatically since pre-Covid-19.

The company is continuing to deal with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, but its memory business was fortified by demand for DRAM chips as data centers adapted to an increase in remote work and education.
Second-quarter operating profit grew 26% from the previous quarter, and 23% year-over-year to 8.15 trillion won (about $6.84 billion), due largely to more sales of DRAM chips. Revenue fell 4% from the previous quarter, and 6% year-over-year, to 53 trillion won, while net profit rose 7% to 5.6 trillion won. Samsung said revenue was impacted by lower sales of smartphones and other devices, but some of that was offset by reduced marketing spending and other cost-cutting measures.
Samsung Electronics will launch new models of its flagship smartphones, including the Galaxy Note and a foldable device, at its online Galaxy Unpacked event on August 5, but will also focus on increasing sales of low- to mid-priced phones, which it expects to drive revenue during the rest of the year.
The company also acknowledged that it faces intense competition from other smartphone makers. In fact, on the same day that Samsung announced its second-quarter earnings, research firm Canalys released a report that said Huawei shipped more smartphones globally than any other vendor in the second-quarter, despite dealing with American government restrictions, displacing Samsung from the top position for the first time.
On the brighter side, many analysts believe that Samsung, along with TSMC, will benefit from Intels recent announcement that it will outsource more semiconductor manufacturing.
Remote services drove demand for DRAM chips
The companys semiconductor division was helped by demand for DRAM chips from data centers that need to fortify their online infrastructure to support remote workers and online education. PC demand also remained solid because of low-end laptop sales.
But sales of chips for mobile devices remained weak as consumers spent less money because of the pandemic. When they did make purchases, they tended to buy low- to mid-end mobile products, which use less powerful chips.
A one-off gain boosted display revenue
Samsung Electronics display panel business earnings improved quarter-over-quarter thanks to a one-off gain that boosted profits from mobile displays. Samsung did not give details about where the gain came form, but Bloomberg reports it was a compensatory payment of about 1.1 trillion won ($924 million) from Apple after the iPhone maker ordered fewer displays than expected.
But overall demand for displays was lower as COVID-19 hit smartphone sales. Operating losses were offset slightly by purchases of monitors by people working from home.
Samsung Electronics said mobile display demand is expected to recover this year as its biggest clients continue to launch new products, despite continuing uncertainties from the pandemic. It also expects orders for mobile and graphic chips to increase as new smartphones and game consoles are released, and anticipates a “full-fledged rebound in earnings from mobile displays” by the end of the year, due largely to sales of mid- to low-end smartphones."

Now, with $22.5 million in new financing and a surging annual run rate that could see the company hit $150 million in revenue, the company is emerging as the largest digital practice for women’s health.
“We saw this tremendous surge in need for our contraception and sensitive health services,” says Nurx chief executive Varsha Rao .
The growth hasn’t come without controversy. Only last year, a New York Times article pointed to corner cutting at the startup which boasts Chelsea Clinton as an investor and advisor.
Undeterred Rao said that the company has now seen tremendous acceleration in all areas of its business. It’s now providing care to over 300,000 patients on a monthly basis, boasts that $150 million run rate and new investors like Comcast Ventures, Trustbridge and Wittington Ventures — the investment arm of one of the largest pharmacy chains in Canada, Shoppers Drug Mart.
The new $22.5 million is an extension on the company’s previous $32 million round and will take the company to profitability by 2021, according to Rao.
And while birth control and contraception are still the largest areas of the company’s business, Nurx is growing its range of services, seeing adoption of its testing for sexually transmitted infections including HPV and herpes and a new treatment area for migraines.
That focus on sexual health and what the company calls sensitive health is different from trying to be a primary care provider says Rao. “Our real focus right now is on our core demographic who are women between the ages of twenty and forty and really focusing on their needs,” she says. “That’s why migraines make a lot of sense. It’s not exclusively hormone related, but it often is… One-in-four women experience migraines and they’re largely from hormonal changes… This is a condition we’re well positioned to address.”
Another way that Nurx differentiates itself from competitors like Hims and Ro, which provide women’s health and contraceptive prescriptions as well, is through its ability to take insurance. “It’s actually pretty challenging to build the system to actually offer insurance,” says Rao. “And yet, we don’t think you can be a true healthcare company if you don’t accept insurance.”"

Shipments grew 20% annually to reach 13.7 million units in the first quarter of 2020, up from 11.4 million units in the previous quarter. Apple Watch stayed in the top position, with 55% global market share, followed in second place by Samsung. Garmin rose to third place.
“Smartwatches are selling well through online retail channels, while many consumers have been using smartwatches to monitor their health and fitness during virus lockdown,” wrote Strategy Analytics senior analyst Steven Waltzer.
In the first quarter of 2020, 7.6 million Apple Watches shipped, a 23% increase from the 6.2 million shipped during the same period one year ago. Apple Watchs market share grew from 54% to 55%.
Samsung shipped 1.9 million smartwatches, compared to 1.7 million last year, while its market share went down from 15% to 14%. Waltzer writes that Samsungs smartwatch growth was slowed by the coronavirus lockdown in South Korea and new competition from rivals like Garmin .
Garmin took the number three position for the first time in two years, shipping 1.1 million smartwatches in the first quarter, a 38% increase from 800,000 a year ago. This grew Garmins share of the global smartwatch market from 7% to 8%, thanks to new models like the Venu with OLED color touchscreen.
Strategy Analytics expects global smartwatch shipments to slow in the second quarter of 2020 because of the pandemic, but recover during the second half of the year, as stores reopen and some consumers turn to smartwatches to help them monitor their health.
“Smartwatches continue to have excellent long-term prospects, as younger and older people will become more health-conscious in a post-virus world,” wrote analyst Woody Oh. “Smartwatches can monitor vital health signs, such as oxygen levels, and consumers may find comfort in having a virtual health assistant strapped to their wrist.”"

While many startups are struggling in the wake of COVID-19 and its economic impacts, services that help regular folks save a bit more or invest their funds are seeing a demand boom.
Coming into 2020 on the back of a huge fundraising year for the fintech cohort, it’s a welcome result for investors and founders alike
Public, a startup whose app allows consumers to invest for free, is enjoying the updraft. So much so that it accelerated a feature release to help capitalize on changing consumer behavior. This morning let’s explore how quickly Public has grown in recent weeks, and why it’s doubling-down on the social side of its service, something that many of its peers lack.
Public launched out of beta last September and saw rapid consumer adoption right away, according to Jannick Malling, the startup’s co-founder and co-CEO. “We’ve been growing very, very quickly since September,” Malling told TechCrunch.
But Public’s service is a different from other investing apps that you might be familiar with. Users can buy fractional shares, invest in ETFs, and invest in themes for free, as you’d expect in 2020. But it also has a social element that makes its application more than just a place to take stock of your portfolio’s performance.
Users can display their investments and stocks that they are interested in on a public page (here’s one). They can also explain their investment choices in a public feed (the company’s name is rather on-the-nose).
Those social tools became more than a neat feature when the markets began to gyrate earlier this year. According to Malling, users were coming to app to handle the market’s ups-and-downs alongside their investing peers. Public’s users “are going through [the turbulence] together,” Malling told TechCrunch, adding that he and his company believes that investing through a downturn with fellow investors is a “a much better way” than hacking it alone.
But Public wanted to provide more social tools to its users, and quickly, once the markets stopped merely going up and began to bounce up and down instead. So the startup accelerated the rollout of private and group messaging, which it launched this morning.
Public had messaging capabilities on the roadmap before COVID-19, but the changing world “made the need so much more apparent,” Malling said. “Times of great uncertainty [are] really when you do need community,” the co-CEO explained in an interview. “You need people that you can have dialogue with.”
Screenshots of Public’s new messaging tool, via the company.
Community in trying times is welcome, and public-market investors are a famously chatty bunch, so messaging might prove to be a smart call for Public. From day trading chat rooms in the 1990s to today’s WallStreetBet denizens, folks putting money to work like to talk about where they are deploying capital and why. Public is not designed for day traders, mind, but that doesn’t mean its longer-term investing users won’t want to talk amongst themselves.
And there are more Public users than ever. Like its competitors (Robinhood, Wealthfront, M1 Finance, Betterment, it’s a list) Public has seen its userbase boom in recent weeks. According to the company, it saw “new customer growth” of +80% in April when compared to March’s results, along with a doubling (+100%) of trading activity and a tripling (+200%) of time spent in its app by users.
That recent growth has been organic, according to Malling. Noting that he views Public as a social network, Malling said that his company “predominantly” grows via organic channels, including user referrals, because it is an “app that gets better with friends on it.”
Looking ahead, TechCrunch asked the company if messaging would be followed up by other, socially focused features in the future. It will, according to Malling, who told TechCrunch the new messaging feature will be prominently featured in the app itself, which he felt was “indicative that [the new feature] is the start of something, and there will be many more exciting updates that we will roll out in the coming months.”
The social aspirations of Public are serious. Malling explained TechCrunch that folks today have Slack for work, for example, and Twitch and Discord for for gaming, but that “there isn’t really that social network for investing and that is ultimately what we think we can build with Public.”"

The company today announced its plans for a new Twitch channel where it will air live chat series and other panel conversations plus music sets, and shows focused on music discovery. The programming will feature artists, producers and other industry experts in an effort appeal to both music creators and fans alike.
While the company has offered other music discovery and creator resources in the past, this is the first time it’s offered live video and a way to interact with the music community in real-time, as it will by way of Twitch’s built-in chat.
The new slate of originals begins on Wednesday, May 6th, at 2 PM ET, with “Studio Sessions with Soulection,” a 90-minute music show hosted by Soulection Founder, Joe Kay. The show promises to feature “surprise guests” who will dig through Soundcloud to find the most exciting, undiscovered tracks and discuss what makes a track stand out.
On Thursday, May 7th, Soundcloud will begin airing its 3-hour weekly live chat series “Cloud Bar,” where creators, industry execs, and influencers will take on topics like how to build a career in music and look at new trends in music discovery, culture, and more.
This week’s guests include CAA music agents, Zach Iser and Caroline Yim; artist managers Byron Wilson, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans, Dae Bogan of The Mechanical Licensing Collective; XXLs Editorial Director, Georgette Cline; hip-hop entrepreneur, Roger Gengo; recording artist, activist, and entrepreneur, Vic Mensa; and Founder and CEO of Biz 3 Publicity, PCC, ICF certified Personal/Professional Coach, Kathryn Frazier.
The discussion will be in three parts, beginning with the timely topic of how the music community is coping with the COVID-19 cancellations of live music, and how they’re working to bring their music to fans online. The other two parts of the conversation will focus on the changes in music discovery occurring due to the pandemic and the subject of self-care for artists.
On May 11th, Soundcloud will introduce two more shows, “Fresh Pressed” and “Fast Track.”
The former aims to give the latest scoop on the best new tracks while the latter will have rising artists creating their own beat in 60 minutes or less using software and instruments in digital music making. “Fresh Pressed” will continue to air every Monday from 2-3:30 PM ET and “Fast Track” will air every other Wednesday from 2-3:30 PM ET.
Twitch has been working to make its resources available to music artists and other creators during the COVID-19 pandemic as it sees the potential to expand beyond gaming.
On that front, the company just hired Spotifys former director of Product Management Tracy Chan as its new head of Product and Engineering for Music. The company also recently partnered with Bandsintown and Soundcloud to fast-track artists onto its Twitch Affiliates platform, so they can make money from their live streams. According to some artists, it’s been easier to make money on Twitch compared with mainstream social platforms.
Twitch is also preparing to air a two-hour “Sessions” music and conversation series on its front page on four consecutive Wednesdays, starting this week at 4 PM ET. Guests will include CAM, Skip Marley, Steve Earle, Brandy Clark and DJ Twin Shadow for the debut show. Viewers will be able to donate to the MusiCares charity’s COVID-19 relief fund during the event.
Soundcloud on Twitch begins Wednesday, May 6th, at 2:00 PM ET, but users can follow the channel and opt to turn on notifications on Twitch now.
The company says it will publish its schedule for the week here on its own site."

The layoffs will affect more than 530 employees. Employees who are laid off will receive at least three months severance pay, one month of equity vesting, and where relevant, extended visa and medical insurance through the end of the year, according to the company’s blog post announcing the reductions.
“We delayed this decision as long as possible so that we could exhaust all other means to secure Careem,” Mudassir Sheikha, the company’s co-founder and CEO, wrote in a blog post Monday.
Careem started in 2012 as a ride-hailing company aiming to compete with Uber rival in the Middle East. In recently years, Careem has diversified its business, expanding into credit transfers, food and package delivery and bus services. Uber bought Careem in March 2019 for $3.1 billion.
Since the COVId-19 pandemic hit, Careem has seen business fall by more than 80%, Sheikha said.
The company made the cuts to preserve the business and its vision to create a consumer-facing “super app” that offers a suite of lifestyle services, including a digital payment platform and last-mile delivery. Those reductions will also affect some previously announced products, namely its mass transportation feature called Careem BUS.
“The economics of the mass transportation business have improved but remain challenging, and at this time, we need to accelerate our investments in deliveries and the Super App,”  We believe Careem BUS is a much-needed offering in some of our core markets, and I predict that the service will reappear on the Careem Super App in the future.” 
The announcement comes just hours after Uber Eats said it will shutter its on-demand food business in several markets, including in the Czech Republic, Egypt, Honduras, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay and Ukraine. Uber Eats said it will transfer its business operations in the in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Careem.
Consumers and restaurants using the Uber Eats app in the UAE will be transitioned to the Careem  platform in the coming weeks, after which the Uber Eats app will no longer be available, according to a regulatory filing detailing the operational shifts."

To note: Twitter’s analyst consensus (provided to journalists) was a little different: it noted that average EPS expectations were -$0.02 on sales of $776 million, with expectations of mDAUs at 164 million.
Times have really changed. In the same quarter a year ago, Twitter reported sales of $787 million, up 18%; net income of $191 million; and diluted EPS of $0.37.
In this difficult time, Twitters purpose is proving more vital than ever,” said CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement. “We are helping the world stay informed, and providing a unique way for people to come together to help or simply entertain and remind one another of our connections. Weve delivered our strongest ever year over year mDAU growth. Public conversation can help the world learn faster, solve common problems, and realize were all in this together. Our task now is to make sure we retain that connection over the long term with the many people new to Twitter.
The company said that the quarter played out in “two distinct periods”, January through early March, which largely performed as expected, it said, and eearly March through the end of the quarter, “when the pandemic became global.”
None of this should come as a surprise. Twitter itself announced more than a month ago that it was removing its own financial guidance because of the instability of its business due to COVID-19 — noting only that it would be lower than expected:
“While the near-term financial impact of this pandemic is rapidly evolving and difficult to measure, based on current visibility, the company expects Q1 revenue to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis,” it wrote at the time. “Twitter also expects to incur a GAAP operating loss, as reduced expenses resulting from COVID-19 disruption are unlikely to fully offset the revenue impact of the pandemic in Q1.”
It did point out one bright spot, which is that it is picking up many more users because of increased “conversation about COVID-19 as well as ongoing product improvements.” Then, it said that quarter-to-date average total mDAU was around 164 million, up 23% from 134 million in Q1 2019 and up 8% from 152 million in Q4 2019.
Generally, Twitter’s fortunes this quarter are in line with results from Alphabet/Google and Facebook, which also reported earnings this week that reflect the impact of reduced advertising revenues due to fallout from the the public health crisis.
But even without the impact of COVID-19 on Twitter’s primary business of advertising, the company had been facing a tough time leading into the quarter. Like eBay, Twitter has been the subject of activist investor activity pushing for leadership and operational changes to improve growth and profitability. (Coincidentally, the same activist investor, Elliott, has been behind both efforts.) Unlike eBay, however, Twitter has managed to keep its CEO in place — co-founder Jack Dorsey — but has had to concede board seats as part of a wider financing package and strategy to refocus the business. There may be questions on the call today to see if all of that has been put on ice given how other factors are now in play.
Breaking out some specific numbers, advertising accounted for the lion’s share of sales at $682 million, with data licensing making up much of the remainder. US revenues were $468 million, up 8% year-over-year, while international was at $339 million, down 4%.
No layoffs announced (not yet) but as with others like Spotify, Twitter is putting a hold on hiring. The company had committed to increase headcount this year by at least 20% (alongside its CEO relocating to Africa temporarily and many other optimistic plans) but this is now being slowed down — to what extent, it did not say, but it did note that 2020 total expense growth would now be “considerably less” than the 20% it had projected.
More to come."

Walmart now hopes to capitalize on the increased demand for speedier delivery with the introduction of a new service that allows consumers to pay to get to the front of the line. The retailer confirmed today it’s launching a new Walmart Grocery service called “Express” which promises orders in 2 hours or less for an upcharge of $10 on top of the usual delivery fee.
The service has been in pilot testing across 100 Walmart stores in the U.S. since mid-April.
Some Walmart customers may have recently received a push notification alerting them to the launch.
To use Express delivery, you first fill your online Walmart Grocery cart with the $30 minimum required for delivery orders or more. At checkout, you’ll see an option beneath the calendar where you pick a delivery date to select the Express service. In many cases, there may no other standard delivery time slots available for the current day or even several days out, which makes the Express service even more appealing to shoppers who need their orders sooner.
Though Walmart is officially promoting Express as a “two-hour” delivery service, in the weeks it’s been piloting the program Walmart has been able to deliver these orders within 56 minutes, on average.
In our tests, we were shown an Express fee of $18.90 to receive a delivery in “55 mins or less,” the app informed us today, April 30. There were no other fees. Without choosing the Express option, the next available time slot was not until next week, on Monday, May 4.
A price of $18.90 is close to — but is not exactly — a $10 increase over Walmart’s typical delivery fees of $7.95 or $9.95, depending on time of day. But we understand the plan is to make Express a flat $10 upcharge moving forward. (Walmart hadn’t been planning to officially announce the launch until next week, so pricing is being updated.)
Like Walmart’s other grocery deliveries, Express deliveries are handled by Walmart’s external network of delivery partners, which vary by market. The retailer won’t comment on if those additional fees are split with their partners, or how, if so.
There could be backlash against a system like this, given how it favors a wealthier customer at a time when food and other critical supplies have run short. During the pandemic, store shelves have often been bare as consumers hoarded things like toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and Lysol cleaners. Now, consumers are being warned that meat shortages are expected soon.
In addition, the pandemic has already exposed the income divide between those who can afford to shop online and low-income customers, who can only use their SNAP benefits (food stamps) in physical stores — except in a handful of states where a USDA pilot has been running. And now those with the means will be able to gain another advantage: paying to get to the limited supplies first.
Walmart says it’s doing things to mitigate these types of concerns, however.
For items where the inventory is so limited it can’t guarantee delivery, it’s removing their availability from the online grocery service. Plus, the retailer says it’s not pushing back standard delivery orders to accommodate the high-paying Express customers. Instead, the Express service is being made available on top of Walmart’s existing grocery pickup and delivery capacity.
The Express service wasn’t dreamed up because of the pandemic, Walmart says, but it did play a role in terms of the timing of the launch.
“The demand that we’ve seen during the coronavirus pandemic is making us push forward and expedite the development of some services that we may have been thinking about,” a Walmart spokesperson explained. “But demand has pushed us to innovate more quickly,” they added.
Walmart is not alone in experiencing a crush of online grocery orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company and others have seen a record number of downloadsfor their grocery apps in recent weeks. In fact, demand for online grocery as well as other e-commerce orders has been so great that Walmart hired 150,000 new workers out of a pool of over a million applicants a full six weeks ahead of schedule, and is now hiring 50,000 more.
Meanwhile, Walmart’s online grocery rivals — Shipt, Instacart and Amazon — have also been hiring hundreds of thousands of new shoppers between them. Amazon had to implement a waitlist system for new Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market pickup and delivery customers due to the rise in online grocery shopping. And Instacart made several adjustments to its app to help better prioritize orders and open up more delivery windows.
In Walmart’s case, its ability to launch Express isn’t solely due to its new hires, we’re told.
The company already employs a workforce of “personal shoppers” who dedicate themselves to pulling for online grocery orders. Walmart says Express is powered by these personal shoppers, only some of which may be the newly hired store associates.
Walmart intends to test Express in its pilot markets before rolling out the service further across the U.S."

The big story
One thing that’s been interesting to see over the past few weeks is how our relationship with screen time has changed. For many, screen time is now all the time and while we haven’t stopped using too many gadgets, there are some we’ve taken out of drawers and closets and added to our repertoire.
For some, it’s been cooking gadgets. While I’ve yet to open up the sous vide gadget I received over the holidays, I was very tempted by my editor’s review of the Ooni gas-fired outdoor pizza oven this week. For me, I’ve strangely seemed to spend a lot more time with the two gadgets I own that are made by Facebook. The currently sold-out Oculus Quest and Facebook Portal are the twin pillars of Facebook’s hardware strategy, but it’s been a bit interesting to see how much more that strategy seems to thrive when we’re all stuck at home.
In a lot of ways, Facebook’s hardware feels built for a quarantine.
The Quest spent a lot of time in my closet when I was out in the world pre-quarantine, but now that I’m in my house most of the day, it spends a good amount of time strapped to my face. When VR was a more hyped technology, there was a broader conversation of whether it encouraged isolation, something promoters of the tech pushed aside, noting that it enables rich shared experiences over the web. As we all host Zoom birthday parties and visit each other’s Animal Crossing islands, it’s becoming clear that with the absence of available physical connections, we can turn a lot of things into rich shared experiences.
In a lot of ways, the Quest is a reminder of what I’m missing out on. The walls of my SF apartment feel less containing when I can hop into a VR workout or jump between games. For the first time, the technology has felt transportive in the way that the ads sold it, but it’s not that the experiences have gotten better, the world has just gotten much worse.
In the same way that VR allows us to re-skin isolation, the Portal allows us to commiserate in it.
My Portal usage has spiked in the past weeks as well. Before stay-at-home orders, coordinating a call with multiple family members was a logistical nightmare and FaceTime calls made it more likely we’d get in touch with each other, but none of my siblings are wandering far from their Portals these days.
We are all still on our phones, but for those of us working from home, mobile we are not. It’s always been fascinating that a tech company which has wildly succeeded at capturing the nuances of mobile computing has been so devoted to selling hardware meant to move us around the internet while staying in place at home. Now, that we are all at home, we are all always there and the Portal really lives up to its name.
Facebook has designed gadgets explicitly built for home use, and more than that, they’re designed devices built around session-based use cases. While Amazon Echos and Google Homes have fit into a persistent IoT platform that are always there for us, Facebook’s gadgets are more high-maintenance, designed for people to fully commit to. For a company that’s focused on the universal nature of its software, its hardware has been built for almost no one’s needs, instead designed to pull people into a future Facebook imagines.
For now, I put the Quest on my face and sometime I tell the Portal to call my sisters, but will these quarantine oddities form tech habits I hold onto after this is all behind us? In these historic times, we are at home and we are craving connections, and, for the time being, the Facebook future feels good.

In a post today on Y Combinator’s site, YC CEO Michael Seibel announced the move, “We have decided to run the S20 batch remotely, because amid the COVID-19 crises, the safety of founders and YC staff is our top priority.”
The Summer 2020 group of founders will operate fully online with interviews, office hours, evening talks, and meetups taking place over video conferencing. This could assumedly extend to the group’s demo day as well, though that was not explicitly stated. Y Combinator had given startups in the most recent class the option to defer an onstage launch until a later Demo Day, it seems that those YC startups may not get that option for 2020.
As YC shifts online, questions are sure to only grow on whether founders are still getting a good deal from the accelerator in the midst of a crisis.
Founders joining the program give up a 7% slice of their company in exchange for $150k and, more importantly, access to YC’s network and group of advisors.
Y Combinator has already been scaling rapidly with larger class sized and this move will force the company to add a radical format change to the mix. Accelerator batches have ballooned in size in recent years, tapping out at 240 startups in this most recent class.
To account for these larger groups, YC has had to experiment with major format changes to how startups are grouped internally and how they present to investors. Losing their Demo Day last session meant founders lost easy access to in-person introductions with the large group of VCs that typically flock to the event.
Last week, TechCrunch reported that YC was changing the terms of its pro rata investment program and would be investing in startups on a case-by-case basis. Shifting their years-old policy of investing in every company’s seed and Series A rounds."

Now Twitch is staffing up to turn this ad hoc use of Twitch into more of a formal product. The company today announced it hired Spotify’s Tracy Chan as its new Head of Product and Engineering for Music.
Chan worked at Spotify for four years as Director of Product Management. In this role, he was primarily focused on leading product strategy and development for Creator platforms and developing analytics tools for artists and labels, including Spotify for Artists and Spotify Analytics.
He had joined Spotify in April 2016 after the streaming music company bought his photo aggregation startup, CrowdAlbum, in order to add to its growing set of marketing tools aimed at artists. Before CrowdAlbum, Chan had also worked at YouTube as a product manager, where he had launched YouTubes’s Creator Platform and what’s now called YouTube Creator Studio.
Now at Twitch, Chan joins a growing music team headed by Twitch’s head of music, Mike Olson. Going forward, Chan will focus on evolving the Twitch experience specifically for live music and helping artists and fans better connect in real-time, Twitch says, in an announcement.
This is not Twitch’s first ex-Spotify’s to join Twitch with a focus on music. Earlier this year, Athena Koumis, formerly of XITE and Spotify, also joined as the Music Partnerships Manager, the company notes.
Though many of artists now performing on Twitch may already have followings on mainstream social platforms — like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube — some have found it’s easier to make money on Twitch, reports have said. In addition, Twitch has made several efforts amid the pandemic to help onboard more musicians to its platform. For example, Twitch and SoundCloud recently announced a partnership that allows SoundCloud creators to start earning money from Twitch streams by fast-tracking their Affiliate status.
Twitch also partnered with Bandsintown on a similar effort focused on quickly giving artists access to the Twitch Affiliate program.
Once live on Twitch, the artists can generate revenue through subscriptions, direct donations, by cheering with Bits (an online tipping feature), by running ads on their channel, and by linking to music and merchandise stores. They can also directly connect with fans via Twitch chat. Some have even taken advantage of Twitch feature’s like raids, which redirect viewers to another live channel, and another that lets a channel broadcast another’s stream when they’re not live. Though designed with the gamer audience in mind, these have also proved useful for musicians looking to collaborate with others in order to grow their Twitch followings.
Though Twitch today is still best known for game streaming, it has been steadily expanding its live music footprint. Since the coronavirus breakout, Twitch has featured live musical performances from artists including John Legend, Diplo, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Lady Antebellum, and dozens of others. Some of these were a part of Twitch’s 12-hour charity stream, Twitch Stream Aid, which benefitted the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO powered by the United Nations Foundation.
In a statement, Chan spoke of the opportunity ahead at Twitch.
“I have spent my career building Creator tools and I believe there is a massive opportunity to help artists connect with their fans through virtual performances and live streaming, which is what led me to Twitch,” said Chan. “Across the board, and especially at this moment in time, we are seeing disruption in the music industry as artists are having to find new ways to both make money and interact with fans. As Twitch looks to expand its offerings for music creators and within the music industry as a whole, I am confident that together with the team, we will be able to build the necessary tools to support artists now and as they continue to explore their new virtual stage,” he said.
Olson, meanwhile, added that Chan’s hire comes at time when Twitch is heavily investing in building more product and monetization tools for music creators.
“Tracy is joining our team at a critical moment as we continue to see growing interest from both new and established musical talent joining Twitch,” said Olson. “His experience in developing video and music Creator tools will be invaluable to our team as we pursue new ways to support artists and connect them to their fans around the world.”"

At least that was the case with First Round Capital. On Friday, the seed-stage firm announced that when it leads a first round in a company, it will always take pro rata in the next outside-led venture round with a commitment of up to $3 million.
Pro rata is a clause in an investment agreement that gives the investor a right to participate in future financings. If investors dont invest in a companys pro rata, that might negatively signal they dont believe in the companys future. I asked Brett Berson, a partner at First Round, to offer more context about the announcement.
The question ‘is your investor taking their pro rata’ is not necessarily a checkbox answer, Berson said. And I think in a time of maximum uncertainty, what a given investor was doing 12 months ago might not be what he or she is doing today."

The company says it has now grown its podcast catalog to over a million shows, up from the 700,000-plus podcasts it was reporting just this March. Podcaster listeners are also “more engaged overall” and “listen to more music,” the company noted, which may have helped boost Spotify’s overall listener and subscriber increases in the first quarter. In addition, podcast consumption was up by “triple digits” in Q1 2020 compared with the same quarter last year, Spotify said.
The streaming music service reported its monthly active user base is now at 286 million, with more users joining the ad-supported free service amid the coronavirus pandemic. It also beat on both earnings and revenue in Q1 2020, with -$0.20 earnings per share on a diluted basis and revenue of roughly $2 billion (1.848 billion.)
Podcasts have now become a key part to Spotify’s business in recent years, and were addressed several times during Spotify’s call with investors on Wednesday.
The company has now made several investments in creator tools, podcast services, and original content and media studios related to its interests in podcasts. Spotify said it plans to continue its acquisitions in the future, as well, if the current environment means “there will be more advantageous deals to be done” — which, of course, it does.
Spotify also said Q1 2020 was its biggest-ever quarter for organic podcast creation.
Podcasters stuck at home were busy creating new shows and increasing their output on existing shows, it seems. Notably, 70% of the new podcasts in the quarter were created within Spotify’s own ecosystem via the Anchor podcast creation platform, the company said.
Spotify had acquired Anchor, a service that aims to make it easier to create podcasts, for an estimated $140 million in 2019. In the months that followed, the platform has continued to innovate on features designed to ease users into becoming podcasters — like its simple “record with friends” option for remote podcasting that’s now become particularly handy amid the quarantine. Yesterday, Anchor released a new feature to turn video chats into audio podcasts, as well.
These help to populate Spotify with a longer tail of content beyond the 800,000-some shows you’ll find on mainstream platforms, like Apple Podcasts.
Spotify, to some extent, addressed concerns that its podcast business had suffered due to the coronavirus outbreak. As more users have shifted their listening from cars and commutes to the home, podcast listening had declined industry-wide over the past several weeks. (Recent reports indicate a turnaround is starting to shape up, however.)
Spotify, however, said podcast consumption grew in the quarter.
The company said podcast consumption grew by triple digits in Q1 2020 compared with the same quarter last year. While that’s not as relevant a metric as a quarter-over-quarter increase would have been, it at least indicates that overall, the podcast side of the business is still growing.
In addition, one of Spotify’s own shows — a daily news podcast in Germany — has already become the second-largest show in the country, and a top 20 show worldwide. Plus, this week Spotify was finally able to add “This American Life,” the No. 5 show in the U.S., to its lineup as an exclusive streaming deal with Pandora lapsed.
The company admitted it was still trying to figure out how to market its own shows, though. It said it would continue experimenting with decisions like which to make exclusive to its service or which to offer in windowing deals, and so on.
And while Spotify has planned to grow ad revenue by way of podcasts, it stressed that the economic downturn which had resulted in ad sales declines has had a minimal effect on this business. Only 10% of Spotify’s overall revenue today comes from ads, so it’s able to weather a drop in ad sales better than some others in the media and entertainment business.
“With so many unknowns, there are some questions we simply can’t answer at this point,” noted Spotify CEO Daniel Ek as to how the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the business. “But I can say that I’m confident that we will continue to be in a position of strength when this is behind us. And that’s because of our models, our scale, and our superior user experience. And, of course, our content pipeline,” he added."

The next flagship, on the other hand, may have to wait. The COVID-19 pandemic is having all manner of knock-on effects on the global economy, and the supply chain is certainly not immune.
The Wall Street Journal this morning is reporting that the iPhone 12 may be among the devices impacted by unexpected issues. Apple is pushing back the production ramp-up of the new devices, per the report, owing to manufacturing issues in Asia and weakened global consumer demand.
This follows a number of similar reports of delays, with some putting the flagship smartphones launch at December, instead of the usual September/October timeframe. The current report, would likely put the phone’s release at around November — in line with that of the iPhone X. The company, unsurprisingly, hasnt commented on the matter. The company doesn’t often comment on supply issues for released products, let alone those that are months away.
Asia was the first to be hit by the pandemic, and while a number of areas have returned to some semblance of business as usual, issues still remain. Beyond that, Apple (like all manufacturers) will have to grapple with the changing face of consumer wants/needs in the face of a pandemic and widespread stay-at-home orders. For many areas, those are expected to continue at least until the summer.

Before the current crisis, Netflix had forecasted 7 million net new paid subscribers for its just-release earnings. With the dramatically changed landscape, growth was obviously going to beat the forecast, but Q1 came in at more than double expectations, with 15.77 million paid net additions. That brings Netflix’s total paid subscriber count to 182.86 million.
Meanwhile, the company also reported revenue of $5.77 billion and earnings per share of $1.57 roughly in line with Wall Street predictions on revenue and slightly behind EPS predictions of $1.65.
In its  investor letter, Netflix outlines three main impacts that the pandemic has had on its finances:
First, our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement. Second, our international revenue will be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown, some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases will be delayed, typically by a quarter
For now, Netflix is treating this growth as a short-term spike, with viewing and growth declining as “progress against the virus will allow governments to lift the home confinement soon.” So it’s forecasting a mere 7.5 million global net additions in Q2.
As for whether how the pandemic might affect the service’s content plans, the company says there will only be a “modest” impact in Q2, mostly in language dubbing.
“No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages, and post-production) will play out,” it says. “The impact on us is less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out. We are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and were complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series.”
As of 4:35pm Eastern, Netflix shares were fluctuating between a slight gain and a slight loss in after-hours trading a sign, perhaps, that that spectacular growth is exactly what investors were expecting.

The internal email, which was viewed by TechCrunch, suggested that the loss of benefits was up to the state and that Tesla wasn’t penalizing employees for choosing to stay at home. CNBC was the first to report the email.
“Once you are called back, you will no longer be on furlough so if you choose not to work, it may impact your unemployment benefits as determined by your local government agency and not by Tesla,” Workman wrote in the email. “We completely respect your decision and will support you, without any penalties from us.”
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said in internal emails to employees that if they feel uncomfortable returning to work, then they should stay at home. However, this latest email puts workers at a crossroads — return to work and risk contracting COVID-19 or stay at home and lose their unemployment benefits.
A screenshot of a portion of the email is posted below.
The email sent Wednesday provided an update to employees as Tesla prepares to restart production at its factory in Fremont, Calif. The factory has been a flashpoint in the debate over when and how businesses reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Musk has lobbed repeated criticisms at Alameda County and its health officials for extending a stay-at-home order to the end of May. Over the weekend, Musk threatened to pull Tesla operations out of the state and sue the county. Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county Saturday seeking injunctive relief.
Even as Musk publicly decried the county going as far to tweet Monday that the factory was reopening in defiance of the stay-at-home order negotiations between government officials and Tesla continued in the background. On Tuesday evening, Alameda County said that Tesla could reopen as soon as next week if it implements additional safety recommendations.
The statement from the Alameda County Public Health Department said that after receiving Teslas COVID-19 site-specific safety plan for its Fremont plant, officials held productive discussions today with Teslas representatives about their safety and prevention plans, including some additional safety recommendations."

While not as radical as Twitters recent decision to let staff work from home forever, the music streaming services move does represent increased openness to the arrangement. 
First noted by Variety, the new policy allows staff to continue working from home through the end of the year. The new edict covers all employees across the globe. The streaming service is headquartered in Stockholm, with a number of regional offices, including New York, London and Tokyo. Spotify operates in 79 countries around the world.
A spokesperson for the company confirmed the move with TechCrunch,
Earlier today, we announced the extension of our work-from-home arrangement for all Spotify employees globally. We will continue to track local government guidelines city-by-city and take a phased approach of opening our offices when we deem it safe to do so. Our employees health and safety is our top priority. No employee will be required to come into the office and can choose to work from home through the end of the year.
The announcement follows similar moves from tech giants, like Facebook and Google. Many have long weighed the ups and downs of a remote workforce, but COVID-19 has caused an acceleration in that way of thinking. These past few months have been a kind of trial by fire for the model. 
Even as many regions have begun to reopen, however, the potential for additional waves of the virus have made the option that much more appealing."

Its first action is a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Amazon Director of UK Customer Fulfillment Stefano Perego in which the group demands the company makes permanent certain steps Amazon has implemented amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In light of the global health crisis, Amazon made some positive changes — changes that workers want to ensure stay long beyond the pandemic. Those changes include an increase of $2 per hour and an extra five minutes’ worth of break time. The company also got rid of productivity feedback, which incentivizes workers to do more, faster.
“They’re talking about taking that away,” Christian Zammarròn, an Amazon warehouse worker in Chicago, told TechCrunch. “I don’t think they should take it away. These are things we need not just during a pandemic but all the time.”
As of April 24, Amazon said it would extend the increased hourly pay through May 16.
“Weve extended the increased hourly pay through May 16,” Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski told TechCrunch. “We are also extending double overtime pay in the U.S. and Canada. These extensions increase our total investment in pay during COVID-19 to nearly $700 million for our hourly employees and partners. In addition, we are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures. We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.”
Amazon Workers International formed after about 40 Amazon warehouse workers around the world gathered in Madrid a couple of months ago. The organization represents Amazon workers from six countries: Germany, Poland, Spain, France, Slovakia and the United States.
“Each country has its own laws but from our conversations at our convenings, we just see that we all have basically the same issues, Zammarròn said. “In Europe, especially, they’ve seen the necessity for international solidarity and how that makes them stronger.”
While Zammarròn’s list of grievances with Amazon is long, what tops his list is retaliation.
“That needs to end,” he said.
Toward the end of March, warehouse workers in Chicago went on a number of safety strikes in “response to Amazon’s complete disregard for our lives with positive COVID-19 cases spreading through our warehouse,” Zammarròn, who helped organize the actions in Chicago, said. “They’ve been retaliating these past weeks trying to scare us and trying to shut us up. We’ve been fighting back.”
In March, Amazon fired worker-activist Chris Smalls, who helped organize a protest at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York. NY Attorney General Leticia James has since said she’s considering taking legal action against Amazon. Then, more recently, a group of Amazon workers at a fulfillment center in Minnesota protested the firing of a worker who stayed home for fear of giving her kids COVID-19. Shortly after the protest, Amazon reinstated the worker.
Already, Amazon warehouse workers have filed unfair labor practice charges and have more on the way, Zammarròn said. Still, he said he’s already seen Amazon change a lot of safety policies. Amazon started providing masks, taking temperatures and providing hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.
“And maybe the biggest thing they did was they slowed down the work,” he said. “They decreased the amount of work so that actually helps in maintaining some social distancing. And these were immediate changes after our safety strikes. Before that, they were basically operating as if everything was normal.”
But workers still want to make it known that their coworkers are continuing to get sick. In the letter, workers say Amazon lacks in the transparency department. Amazon, however, maintains that when it confirms a case of COVID-19 among workers, it communicates that to other people who work at that same site.
This letter of demands is just the first of what we’re seeing from AWI.
“Our international solidarity will definitely grow,” he said. “This is a very important aspect of what we’re doing and what any worker movement should do, which is expressing coordinated international demands and coordinated international actions.”"

The space received a lot of attention in 2017 and 2018 as leagues formed, teams raised money and surging popularity fostered a whole ecosystem of new companies. Last year featured some big fundraises, but esports wasnt the hot new thing in the tech world anymore.
This unexpected, compulsory work-from-home era may drive renewed interest in the space, however, as a larger market of consumers discover esports and more potential entrepreneurs identify pain points in their experience.
To track where new startups could arise this year, I asked seven VCs who pay close attention to the esports market where they see opportunities at the moment:
Their responses are below.
This is the second investor survey Ive conducted to better understand VCs views on gaming startups amid the pandemic; they complement my broader gaming survey from October 2019 and an eight-article series on virtual worlds I wrote last month. If you missed it, read the previous survey, which is based on my theory that games are the new social networks.
Which specific areas within esports are most interesting to you right now as a VC looking for deals? Which areas are the least interesting territory for new deals?
Everything around competitive gaming is of interest to us. With Twitch streaming north of two BILLION hours of game play thus far during the pandemic, this continues to be an area of great interest to us. Fantasy, real-time wagering, match-making, backend infrastructure and other areas of picks and shovels-like plays remain front burner for us relative to competitive gaming.
What challenges does the esports ecosystem now need solutions to that didnt exist (or werent a focus) 2 years ago?
As competitive gaming is still so very new with respect to the greater competitive landscape of content, teams and events, the Industry should be nimble enough to better respond to dramatic market shifts relative to its analog, linear brethren. A native digital industry, getting back “online”will be orders of magnitude more straightforward than in so many other areas."

But even before the pandemic, gig workers had become a staple in the lives of many people who use services like Uber, Lyft, Instacart, DoorDash and Postmates. Despite the growing presence of gig workers, little has been known about them — with the exception that many are independent contractors who receive unpredictable pay and very few benefits. Thanks to a new survey about gig workers in San Francisco, that’s starting to change.
Many gig workers, for example, are people of color, according to a study conducted by San Francisco’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) and led by UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner. The study, which surveyed 643 gig workers across platforms like DoorDash, Instacart, Shipt and others, also found that many are in financially precarious situations and are struggling to make ends meet.
Here are some stats based on those surveyed:
<ul><li>78% of gig workers are people of color
<ul><li>29% Asian</li><li>23% Latinx</li><li>22% white</li><li>12% black</li><li>13% mixed race</li></ul></li><li>56% of gig workers are immigrants</li><li>21% of gig workers do not have health insurance</li><li>15% of gig workers need some sort of public assistance, like food stamps or housing vouchers</li><li>71% of gig workers work more than 30 hours a week</li><li>Before expenses, ride-hailing drivers earn $900 per week on average; food and grocery delivery workers earn an average of $500 per week</li><li>For delivery workers, tips account for 30% of their estimated earnings</li></ul>This survey comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has shined a brighter spotlight on this essential workforce and the basic protections they often lack.
This is a very critical workforce for a number of reasons, Benner previously told TechCrunch. They are particularly vulnerable and susceptible, especially early on with drivers taking people to and from the airport. But now as were potentially seeing a spike in the online ordering of groceries and food delivery, these people doing the deliveries are providing essential services during this time of having to shelter in home and are potentially vulnerable. And if theyre not being careful in handling food and groceries, they could potentially be spreading [COVID-19].
Now that these results are out, the survey will help the city to shape policy as it relates to gig workers. What’s become clear is that gig workers need better economic security, unemployment benefits and access to good health care.
Some progress is being made in this area, but not quickly enough. The progress also tends to come with pushback from tech companies. As California gig worker protections bill AB5 was becoming law, for example, Uber, Instacart and Lyft put millions of dollars behind a ballot initiative that would enable them to continue classifying workers as independent contractors. And while gig workers are eligible for unemployment benefits, many are struggling to get that relief.
To better support gig workers, crucial reforms need to happen, Shahid Buttar, an activist and attorney who is running for Congress against Nancy Pelosi, told TechCrunch.
“A crucial reform that I think meets the needs of gig workers and working-class Americans, generally, is creating a national health plan — Medicare for all — establishing a right to healthcare without being continent on people needing to pay for insurance or deductibles or their co-pays on the private market,” he said. “That will not only ensure that gig worked have access to care but if you think particularly about gig workers in the time of the pandemic, especially through the lens of undiagnosed potential transmitters, they are people who need care and they need equipment. So the personal protective equipment for gig workers is important and crucial, not just for their rights and workplace safety, but for public health as well.”

The company released details its preclinical research on Friday, announcing that it has found an antibody that provides “100% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of healthy cells after four days incubation.” These results are from a preclinical study that still has to undergo peer review, and in an in vitro laboratory study (meaning not in an actual human being) but still a promising development as the company continues to work on production of an antibody “cocktail” that could provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 even in case of mutations in the virus.
Sorrento says that they believe this antibody, which is labelled STI-1499, stood out among billions of candidates it has been screening from its extensive human antibody library for its ability to completely block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein with a human cell target receptor. That means it prevents the virus from attaching to the host’s healthy cell, which is what leads to incubation and infection.
The nature of the antibody’s efficacy means that Sorrento currently believes it will be the first antibody to be included in the cocktail it is developing, which will be made up of a large number of different antibodies that show efficacy in blocking the attachment of the spike protein, in order to provide multiple avenues of protection that are designed to remain effective even if the virus mutates in transmission from person to person, or within the same individual. One of the big outstanding questions that researchers are working on answering currently is just how mutagenic SARS-CoV-2 actually is, since many coronaviruses like the common cold show a tendency to mutate pretty quickly, rendering long-lasting cures and treatments difficult to develop.
Sorrento’s COVID-SHIELD is meant to address this through a potent mix of different antibodies that provide protection against different strains of the virus, but the company says it will also be pursuing development of the STI-1499 antibody on its own as a dedicated, standalone therapy. The company is already in discussion with regulators about how to expedite development of that potential treatment, and is ramping its production capacity as well with the goal of producing as many as one million doses at the same time it pursues FDA approval for its use.
It’s definitely worth cautioning that no treatment or vaccine is likely to be a ‘magic bullet’ in treating SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, but this is still a promising development, and one to watch as it undergoes clinical trials and the therapeutic development and regulatory process."

With the future of the COVID-19 pandemic still uncertain around the world, the show will come with some major caveats. 
For starters, the show, which traditionally takes over Berlins Messe conference center, will be broken up into four distinct events. Those include: IFA NEXT meets IFA SHIFT Mobility, IFA Global Markets and IFA Business, Retail &amp; Meeting Lounges. A fourth event, the Virtual IFA Experience, will be held online, in keeping with most of the rest of the conference world. 
Each event will be limited to 1,000 attendees per day. While the organizers hope that the overall public health situation will improve between now and September, organizers write, they have decided to err on the side of caution and meet the strictest safety standards possible.
The limited scope of the show is a step in the right direction, as are the increased on-site sanitation measures, but holding such a large gathering in the late-Summer is perhaps not the side of caution relative to the difficult decisions being made by the rest of the industry at this point in time. IFA, which is relatively unique in being open to the public, will now be invite-only. That includes 800 journalist, which will comprise the lion’s share of attendees. 
Germany is currently number eight on the list of COVID-19 deaths, at just over 8,000. In spite of a recent ease on shutdown restrictions, Berlin has been hit with a wave of protesters demanding an end to a government enforced lockdown in recent weeks. According to The New York Times, more than 10,000 people have joined in protests across the country.
If it goes ahead as planned, IFA will be one of the first major tech shows to be held in-person since CES in January. Today, notably, was set to be the first day of Build, an event that Microsoft moved online, in keeping with moves of much of the rest of the industry."

Uber is also closing 45 offices, and rethinking its approach in areas like freight and autonomous vehicle technology.
This comes just weeks after Uber laid off 3,700 employees in order to save about $1 billion in costs. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Uber has laid off about 25% of its workforce.
Rides have been hit hard amid the coronavirus. More specifically, rides are down about 80%, according to the company.
“I knew that I had to make a hard decision, not because we are a public company, or to protect or stock price, or to please our Board or investors,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a memo to employees today. “I had to make this decision because our very future as an essential service for the cities of the world — our being there for millions of people and businesses who rely on us — demands it. We must establish ourselves as a self-sustaining enterprise that no longer relies on new capital or investors to keep growing, expanding, and innovating.”
Meanwhile, Uber is in talks to buy GrubHub to beef up its food delivery business, UberEats, according to The WSJ and Bloomberg.
Uber first approached Grubhhub earlier this year with an offer, but the two companies are still in talks, according to the WSJ. A Bloomberg report says the deal could be finalized sometime this month. This comes a few months after reports emerged that Grubhub was looking to sell Uber, DoorDash and others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery has been hot. In Q1, Uber Eats experienced major growth with gross bookings of $4.68 billion, up 52% from that same quarter one year ago. Grubhub, meanwhile, saw gross food sales increase to $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion in the same period last year.
“I will caution that while Eats growth is accelerating, the business today doesn’t come close to covering our expenses,” Khosrowshahi wrote in the memo today. “I have every belief that the moves we are making will get Eats to profitability, just as we did with Rids, but ut’s not going to happen overnight.”
In an attempt to organize more around its core offering, Uber is shutting down Incubator after less than one year of launch. It’s also shutting down AI Labs and looking into alternatives for Uber Works, a service Uber launched in October to match workers with shifts.

In addition, Facebook said it will be posting COVID-19 related information, tools and tips for small businesses in both the Facebook and Instagram apps. Businesses can access this information through the Facebook app shortcuts or their Instagram business profile.
These changes come on top of a $100 million grant program for small businesses that Facebook announced in March, as well as other new features like the ability to share temporary service changes."

Construction on the factory, which will eventually produce its R1T and R1S electric vehicles for consumers as well as 100,000 delivery vans for Amazon, has restarted with employees returning in phases. Despite the shutdown and gradual restart, the timeline for the Amazon delivery vans is still on track, according to a statement from Amazon released Thursday.
In September, Amazon announced it had ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian as part of its commitment to The Climate Pledge to become net zero carbon by 2040. Vans will begin delivering to customers in 2021, as previously planned. About 10,000 of electric vehicles will be on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030, Amazon said in a statement Thursday.
Rivian has pushed the start of production on the R1T and R1S to 2021. The company had initially planned to start production and begin deliveries of the electric pickup truck and SUV in late 2020. That timeline has been adjusted. Rivian had always planned to deliver the R1T truck first, followed by the R1S.
The COVID-19 pandemic forced the company to adjust its timeline due to supply constraints. However, Rivian is now working on bringing the production and delivery timeline of the R1T and R1S closer together.
For now, the company is focused on work inside and outside the factory. About 335 Rivian employees were on site before COVID hit. Today, about 116 are on site with plans to gradually bring back the remaining employees. Rivian did not furlough any employees and continues to pay all workers their wages.
About 109 contractors are also back at the factory working on the interior. Another 120 to 140 contractors are working outside to expand the factory from 2.6 million to 3 million square feet.
The company has implemented new safety practices under a 4-phase plan, according to Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe. Temperature checks are carried out and workers are supplied with protective clothing and equipment.
The vehicle engineering and design teams have also developed digital methods to make sure that program timing remains on track, according to Scaringe."

Many are completing more deals and increasing their cheque size by as much as 18%. However, the pandemic has reduced their total capital to invest in 2020 by just over 61%, while just under 60% think the effects of COVID-19 will negatively affect their ability to invest for the rest of 2020. Over 250 Angels completed the full survey in the last two weeks, after TechCrunch exclusively published it.
These are the findings of new UK initiative Activate our Angels (AoA). The initiative comes just as the UK governments Future Fund for startups, which has been criticized as being inadequate for the needs of Angel and Seed-stage startups, is poised to be launched some time this week.
AoA was started by Nick Thain the former CEO and co-founder of GiveMeSport, which was acquired last year and includes representatives from 7percent Ventures, Forward Partners, Portfolio Ventures, ICE, Foundrs, Punk Money, Humanity, Culture Gene, Barndance, Bindi Karia and Stakeholderz.
Activate our Angels started its campaign just under two weeks ago with the goal to give founders actionable data to help them make funding decisions, during and post-lockdown.
The survey shows that while angels are currently investing, founders will need to lock this funding down fast, as 59% of Angels surveyed says their future investing will be negatively affected the longer the lockdown goes on.
This becomes more important if a startup has raised under £250,000.
Furthermore, the survey concluded that Angels are investing 18% more per deal and have increased the frequency of deals in Lockdown by over 122% from 0.27 deals per month in 2019 to 0.6 deals per month in the last 3 months.
Angels are looking for increased runway and revenue generative businesses, and theyre seeing reduced valuations and smaller rounds.
Additionally, Angels are told the survey that they have 61% of the capital to invest in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests that Angels are making hay while the lockdown-sun is shining said the survey.
Consequently, Angels will have significantly less money for the rest of 2020.
For start-ups that have not raised yet, the findings suggest they should do their first round as soon as possible.
For start-ups who have already raised, this impending angel capital crunch makes initiatives such as the forthcoming government-backed Future Fund as important as ever, says the survey.
If Angels are not investing in Lockdown, they are holding cash and waiting to be confident that Covid-19 is over. The best way to contact them is via an introduction/recommendation, email or linkedIn, not via Social Media, it added.
The results from the survey have been summarised below.
 66.7% of Angel investors are still investing during Lockdown

The Estonia-based company is today announcing that it has picked up an additional 100 million ($109 million) in equity funding. Bolt also confirmed that is now valued at 1.7 billion (or nearly $1.9 billion at today’s rates).
The investment is coming from a single investor, Naya Capital Management, which was also a major backer of the company in its last round, a $67 million Series C in July 2019. Technically this would make this latest round a Series D although we are checking that detail with the company.
The funding is one more example of how investors are continuing to support their most promising, and/or most capitalised, portfolio companies as they face drastic losses of business during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can only be more complicated for a startup built on a business model that — even in the best of times — is very capital-intensive.
Before this round, in April we’d been hearing that Bolt was running out of runway and that they were in discussion also with the Estonian government — a big supporter of the country’s tech industry — to underwrite debt in the company. We have also asked Bolt if it raised any debt funding and will update this as we learn more.
Bolt — which says it has 30 million users in over 35 countries globally — has now raised over 300 million, with other investors including Nordic Ninja a new fund out of Helsinki backed by a number of Japanese LPs to invest in Northern European startups (Bolt is based out of Tallinn)  Creandum, G Squared, Invenfin (a fund out of South Africa backed by investment holding company Remgro) and Superangel, a fund out of Estonia that has been backing the startup since its earliest days, as well as Didi (and, by association, SoftBank and Uber), Daimler, Korelya Capital and Spring Capital.
Formerly known as Taxify, Bolt rebranded last year as it expanded beyond private car rides into other areas like electric scooters and food delivery — and the plan will be to use this funding to expand all three business areas in the coming months, along with newer product categories like Business Delivery in-city same-day courier services and Bolt Protect for people to continue to use its ride-hailing services by kitting out cars with plastic sheeting between driver and passenger seats.
Uber, Bolt’s publicly traded business rival, has laid bare just how painful the pandemic has been for business. The company has laid off nearly 7,000 employees in recent weeks, and while we currently have little visibility of the impact on the contractors it engages to move people, food and other items in its network, its next quarterly earnings (which will cover the full brunt of the pandemic) should more clearly spell out the drop-off in overall business.
Bolt doesn’t go into the details of that situation itself, except to acknowledge that business is not as usual.
Even though the crisis has temporarily changed how we move, the long-term trends that drive on-demand mobility such as declining personal car ownership or the shift towards greener transportation continue to grow,” said Markus Villig, CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “We are happy to be backed by investors that look past the typical Silicon Valley hype and support our long term view. I am more confident than ever that our efficiency and localisation are a fundamental advantage in the on-demand industry. These enable us to continue offering affordable transportation to millions of customers and the best earnings for our partners in the post-COVID world.
A lot of people have talked about how fundraising has become more complicated now. Not only are people not able to meet in person and get more embedded in evaluating an opportunity, but many are unable to see what the future will hold in terms of market demand and the overall economy.
That’s left a lot of the activity at the moment spread between startups that are seeing a lot of business lift precisely because of present circumstances; startups that have businesses that are continuing to enjoy a lot of trade despite present circumstances; and startups that are strong enough (or already so highly capitalised) that investors want to support them to make sure they don’t go under. More typically, startups that are securing funding are falling into more than one of the above categories, as is the case with Bolt.
We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Bolt at this stage in the companys growth story,” Masroor Siddiqui, managing partner, CIO and founder of Naya Capital Management, said in a statement. “Under Markus leadership, Bolt has established itself as one of the most competitive and innovative players in global mobility. We believe that Bolt is helping drive a fundamental change in how consumers interact with the transport infrastructure of their cities and look forward to the companys continued execution on its strategic vision."

Reuters and Electrek were the first to report the changes. The base price of Model 3 standard range plus is now $37,990, a $2,000 reduction. But the biggest cuts were made to Tesla’s more expensive, luxury vehicles, the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV.
The Model S long range plus now starts at $74,990, a decrease of $5,000. The more expensive Model S performance as well as the two Model X configurations also saw prices slashed by $5,000.
The price cuts come as automakers seek ways to attract buyers after months of a lockdown prompted by the COVID-19, which has dampened demand and upended the economy. The traditional big three U.S. automakers Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have turned to 0% financing rates as well as deferred or longer term payment options. Other automakers including Hyundai Motor America, Kia Motors America, Nissan North America, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A, and Volkswagen of America have also announced incentives and payment plans aimed at preventing existing owners from defaulting on loans as well as incentivizing new buyers.
Tesla has also removed mention of free unlimited supercharging for new Model S and Model X sales along with the price cuts.
The company has waffled on the free supercharging incentive before, removing it and bringing it back over the past several years.
In the early days, free unlimited supercharging was part of the package of buying a Tesla vehicle. The automaker began phasing out free unlimited access to its supercharger network when it announced that customers who buy cars after January 1, 2017 will have 400 kilowatt-hours, or about 1,000 miles, of free charging every year. Once owners surpassed that amount, they would be charged a small fee.
Tesla then narrowed the free unlimited access to superchargers through a referral program and only to buyers of performance versions of the Model S, Model X and Model 3. The free unlimited supercharger referral program is now set to end September 18.
BREAKING: All new Model S and Model X orders now come with free unlimited Supercharging 
— Tesla (@Tesla) August 3, 2019
Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has called the perk “unsustainable” has brought back the perk several times since to drive sales. In August 2019, the company resurrected the benefit in an effort to boost sales of its more expensive electric vehicles."

Unlike other segments of the startup and tech world, where valuations have been slashed, early-stage companies focused on building new games, gaming infrastructure and virtual or extended reality entertainment are having no trouble raising money. They’ve even seen valuations rise, investors said.
“Valuations have increased pretty significantly in the gaming sector. Valuations have gone up 20 to 25% higher than I would have seen prior to this pandemic,” Phil Sanderson, a co-founder and managing director at Griffin Gaming Partners, told fellow participants on a virtual panel during the Los Angeles Games Conference earlier this month.
Driving the appetite for new investments is the entertainment industry’s bearhug of virtual events, animated features, games and social media platforms after widespread shelter-in-place orders made physical events an impossibility."

Moderna was the first company to begin human clinical trials of its vaccine candidate in the U.S., and the last stage of its study will include 30,000 people and be conducted in partnership with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
The aim of the study will be to show definitive clinical proof that Moderna’s vaccine actually does prevent people from developing COVID-19, and, secondarily, that it prevents at least severe symptoms and cases that require hospitalization from materializing. Moderna’s second-stage clinical trial kicked off last month, and the company has previously said that it could potentially begin offering experimental doses available to healthcare workers in limited capacities as early as this fall.
The pace of development of a number of leading vaccine candidates is actually moving just as quickly, if not more quickly. Johnson &amp; Johnson said early this week that it would start trials of its vaccine later in July, while AstraZeneca and its research and development partner the University of Oxford will be entering its own final-stage clinical trials as of this month.
Moderna’s vaccine candidate is an mRNA vaccine, which is a technology that essentially provides instructions to healthy cells to produce antibodies to the coronavirus, without having to actually introduce any of the active or inactive virus itself. mRNA vaccines, while used in veterinary medicines, are relatively new technology and have not yet been approved for use in human patients, but they represent a number of the early vaccine attempts, because of their advantages in terms of speed of development and the lessened theoretical health risk they pose to people, including early trial participants."

The launch occurred at 1:13 AM EDT (5:13 PM local time) and went off without a hitch. Rocket Lab later confirmed that payload deployment also went exactly to plan once the Electron reached its target orbit.
Rocket Lab has been gearing up for significant expansion of its launch capabilities, with a new launch site in the U.S. on Wallops Island in Virginia. The launch facility is now open, and its first mission had been scheduled to fly earlier this year, but that launch got pushed back in part because of delays resulting from NASA’s efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 with facility closures and a focus on essential missions.
New Zealand is now fully out of lockdown, however the country’s fast action and relatively small, dispersed population allowed it to contain cases of COVID-19 fairly quickly, and reduce the infection rate to zero. That’s good news both for Rocket Lab’s existing operation, and for its ongoing work to establish a second launch site at its Mahia facility, which is well underway and could go into operation sometime later this year."

Here’s your Daily Crunch for June 5, 2020.
1. Twitter has a record-breaking week as users looked for news of protests and COVID-19
Civil unrest due to the nationwide George Floyd protests drove Twitter to a record number of new installs this week, according to data from two app store intelligence firms, Apptopia and Sensor Tower. While the firms exact findings differed in terms of the total number of new downloads or when records were broken, the firms agreed that Twitters app had its largest-ever week, globally.
For example, according to Sensor Tower, Twitter saw just over 1 million installs on Monday, making it the day with the most single-day installs since the firm began tracking app store data on January 1, 2014.
2. Signal now has built-in face blurring for photos
This is supposed to make it easy to protect someones identity without leaving any trace on other, less secure apps. After noting Signals support of the protests against police brutality, founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote in a blog post, Weve also been working to figure out additional ways we can support everyone in the street right now. One immediate thing seems clear: 2020 is a pretty good year to cover your face.
3. Facebook adds labels identifying state-controlled media
Facebook will soon add labels to news outlets owned or otherwise controlled by a government that doesn’t necessarily mean the information is false or unreliable, but at least it’s worth considering the source. Those outlets will also be banned from buying ads starting this summer.
4. OTTO Motors raises $29M to fill factories with autonomous delivery robots
The OTTO Motors division of Clearpath Robotics launched in 2015. It’s landed a number of contracts to bring its autonomous mobile robot platform into factories, with customers including GE, Toyota, Nestlé and Berry Global.

Which is the first affected and one of the most directly affected businesses of the COVID-19 era.
Hartz, who co-founded the company with her husband Kevin Hartz and Renaud Visage, joined ExtraCrunch Live recently to discuss moving forward when your core business isnt just threatened, but wiped out completely.
You never as a founder at least I never ever wondered what would happen if the whole basis of our mission was tested, she said.
The events world was one of the first industries to feel the pandemic’s impacts and will likely be among the last to be restored. For Eventbrite, which was built on a core business of in-person events and event ticketing, it meant making swift decisions to stay afloat.
External data show some bright spots. According to an operational update from Eventbrite, paid ticket volume on its platform increased 33% in May compared to April 2020. Eventbrite is down 82% in paid tickets in May 2020 compared to the same month year ago.
A massive market and industry dislocation and disruption. I mean, we’re a living example of that, she said. It’s not a victory lap. Certainly, we’re seeing some really exciting signs of recovery, but it’s still very sobering.
Hartz offered founders at all levels advice on how to work on culture during a crisis and offered tips on communication and transparency.
We also chatted about how open consumers are to paying for virtual events, how the company curates and moderates political events and how Eventbrite plans to address racial injustice beyond, in Hartzs words, episodic outrage.
We pulled out a couple of highlights for you to peruse.
How she sees events changing in the next 18 months
Structurally, events are pivoting to in-person. So it’s not just pivoting online. A good example is the Beanstalk Music Festival in Colorado, a two-day music festival that pivoted to an in-person drive-in night concert. They were wildly successful in selling tickets to this new format.
It was a testament to the strength of their community and the pent-up demand to get together and listen to great music. But what we’re seeing beyond sort of those really creative uses of new types of space and venues that are outdoors are smaller events. Classes, workshops, seminars, small meetups are starting to come back. I think that as creators start to think about how to bring their community back in person, there’s a huge element of trust that exists in this new world.
Were helping our creators establish that trust and be very upfront about what their event goers and attendees can expect in that moment as you bring yourself together in-person again.

As noted earlier this month, shipment growth slowed but didnt stop in Q1, even as many potential customers have far fewer steps to track. And according to new numbers from Canalys out today, smartwatches in particular continued to grow in spite of it all.
Overall, the category grew 12% year-over-year for Q1, up to 14.3 million. China, in particular, saw a big uptick in shipments a full 66% over Q1 2019. Cellular models from Xiaomi and Apple were big hits, owing to a nationwide push for eSIM adoption. North America continued to see an increase, as well, but made up less than a third of all shipments for the first time in the firms reporting.

Apple actually saw a 13% dip in shipments for the quarter, but remained the leader in marketshare by a significant margin, at 36.3%. Analysts believe that a shift in focus toward AirPods has been part of the slow down for the company in North America and Europe. Second place Huawei is gaining fast, too. A 113% increase in shipments put the company at 14.9% of the total market up from 7.9 percent the year prior. Huawei continues to have a strong presence in China, and other local electronics giants Xiaomi and Oppo are expected to be strong drivers in the category moving forward.
Beyond that, the report doesnt go into great detail with regard to what continued driving smartwatch sales as categories like smartphones sputtered along. I suspect that while consumers have been put off by an inability to meet personal activity goals, an increased interest in vital signs and other quantifiable statistics has driven some to take a closer look at such products, as they become an increasingly viable tool for day-to-day health tracking."

SaaS companies have always been focused on allowing work from anywhere there’s access to a computer and internet connection, and while the economy is reeling from COVID-19 fallout, modern software companies are thriving.
That’s because the pandemic has forced companies that might have been thinking about moving to the cloud to find tools what will get them there much faster. SaaS companies like Zoom, Box, Slack, Okta and Salesforce were there to help; cloud security companies like CrowdStrike also benefited.
While it’s too soon to say how the pandemic will affect work long term when it’s safe for all employees to return to the office, it seems that companies have learned that you can work from anywhere and still get work done, something that could change how we think about working in the future.
One thing is clear: SaaS companies that have reported recent earnings have done well, with Zoom being the most successful example. Revenue was up an eye-popping 169% year-over-year as the world shifted in a big way to online meetings, swelling its balance sheet.
There is a clear connection between the domestic economy’s rapid transition to the cloud and the earnings reports we are seeing — from infrastructure to software and services. The pandemic is forcing a big change to happen faster than we ever imagined.
Zoom and CrowdStrike are two companies expected to grow rapidly thanks to the recent acceleration of the digital transformation of work. Their earnings reports this week made those expectations concrete, with both firms beating expectations while posting impressive revenue growth and profitability results."

Led by the stick of COVID-19 rather than the carrot of the benefits of more flexible work life, a lot of organizations, and the people who power them, have only relatively recently started to get to grips with this concept. But some have had their finger on the pulse of cloud computing and how that relates to enterprise productivity for years.
Come join us on Thursday, July 9, at Extra Crunch Live to hear from Jason Green of Emergence Capital, one of the leading investors (and VC firms) promoting and funding some of the biggest startups in this space.
Extra Crunch Live is open exclusively to Extra Crunch subscribers. If youre not already an Extra Crunch member, you can join here.
For the uninitiated, the EC Live format is at once direct and wide-ranging, an hour-long conversation that not only covers some of the biggest issues in tech, building startups and investing today — and boy do we have a lot of issues right now — but gets to the heart of them, in a lighter format that’s actually fun to watch — as you can see from past talks with Sequoia’s Roelof Botha and Homebrew’s Hunter Walk.  (See the whole schedule of Extra Crunch Live talks here.)
July 9 should be an especially good one because, well, Green is full of beans.
That is to say, he’s been very outspoken in the last few months, leading the (reassuring? alarming?) charge for startups to just write off the last quarter and focus on the future.
Sounds flippant? Not really. Green has years of experience to draw on — a long track record backing some of the most game-changing and successful startups of the last decade+ in the areas of cloud computing, enterprise and enterprise productivity, and specifically in how they cross over. They include Box, SalesLoft, ServiceMax, SteelBrick, SuccessFactors, Gusto (formerly ZenPayroll) and Yammer, with Emergence itself also an early backer of Zoom, Salesforce, Crunchbase and Clearbanc.
For founders, other investors and anyone involved in any aspect of deal-making, especially for enterprise startups, it’s a must-watch.
Join Jason and me next week. We’re looking forward to it.

The strategy prompted by COVID-19 shutdowns is a departure for Ford, which has traditionally revealed new vehicles at auto shows or other in-person media events. More than three years ago, Ford announced it was bringing back the Bronco after years of customer requests and speculation. The mid-size SUV that ended its 30-year production run in 1996 was supposed to debut in June at the revamped North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Ford was forced to come up with a new strategy after organizers cancelled the 2020 NAIAS due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Bronco will be revealed in 3-minute films that will air during the first commercial break in the 8 p.m. ET hour July 13 on ABC, ESPN and National Geographic. Ford will begin taking reservations for the Bronco as the films air. The automaker plans to share additional information about the upcoming Bronco models on its YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter channels.
The short films will be available on-demand via Hulu the following day.
Ford is collaborating with Disney CreativeWorks to create the reveal stories. Jimmy Chin, director, cinematographer, photographer and professional climber best known for the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo, was tapped for the project.
“Ford Bronco is an icon that has captured people’s imaginations and inspired them to explore the most remote corners of America and the world since the 1960s,” said Jim Farley, Ford’s chief operating officer. “As a new era for Bronco begins, we’re proud to tap the strengths of epic adventurers like Jimmy Chin and Disney storytellers to help bring Bronco to life and inspire millions of people to get out into the wild.”
The short films will be different for each channel. On ABC, the film will star country music singer Kip Moore and air during “CMA Best of Fest,” the Country Music Association’s three-hour concert experience. Professional climber Brooke Raboutou will be featured in a film that will air on ESPN during its SportsCenter show. hin highlight a new Bronco model during the National Parks: Yosemite episode on the National Geographic channel. Chin will judge a hashtag challenge contest and appear in an Instagram Story featuring the Bronco on NatGeo’s Instagram account, Ford said."

The retailer had paused its plans to rollout grocery pickup this spring, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a factor. It said it didn’t have time to train employees on the new processes. Today, those plans are back in motion. The company now says it expects to have fresh and frozen grocery pickup available across 1,500 stores in the U.S. within a matter of months.
The addition isn’t being powered by Target’s grocery delivery service, Shipt, but will instead utilize store staff to pick and bag items — much as they do today for Target’s existing Order Pickup and Drive Up services.
However, consumers won’t have access to all of Target’s fresh and frozen food items at launch. The pickup services will offer 750 fresh and frozen items on top of the thousands of non-perishables already available. This includes produce, dairy, bakery, meat and frozen products.
In the same order, shoppers can also order from the more than 250,000 items available for pickup across categories like home, apparel, essentials and more.
A company spokesperson tells us the decision to limit fresh and frozen product selection to 750 items was related to how the service was used in early tests. The company found that Target shoppers largely used pickup to shop for grocery essentials in between larger trips to the store.
Both Drive Up and Order Pickup will offer the same product selection, we understand.
Target says the fresh and frozen items will be stored in temperature-controlled storage in the pickup area in the front of the store, until the customer arrives for their pickup.
The service is free to use and doesn’t require an order minimum or membership. In addition, Target RedCard holders and Target Circle members will be able to utilize their discounts on the new grocery items, as well.
Target is currently rolling out fresh and frozen grocery in the Midwest region, following its successful tests of grocery pickup in the Twin Cities and Kansas City markets. This will make the service available to 400 stores. It expects to reach 1,500 stores by the U.S holiday season.
The retailer is one of many grocers to now offer pickup services in the U.S. For Walmart, online grocery has played a large role in its growing e-commerce sales. In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2019, ahead of the pandemic, Walmarts e-commerce sales grew by 35%. As the coronavirus outbreak drove more shoppers to buy online and pickup outside of Walmart sales, the retailer reported a 74% jump in e-commerce sales in Q1.
Target, meanwhile, reported in Q1 its same-day services were growing in popularity as well, due to the pandemic. It even saw days where its volume of order pickup was twice as high as Cyber Monday. And on the Friday before Easter, it did more volume via Shipt’s delivery service than it did in a typical week.
Also in Q1, Target’s digital sales overall grew 141% while its combination of same-day services (Shipt, Drive Up, and Order Pickup) grew 278%. Of the millions of shoppers using Drive Up, 40% were new to the service — an indication of how the pandemic has shifted consumer behavior.
But Q1 was not all good news for the retailer. It said it was spending more on labor, selling fewer high-margin items, and writing down apparel and other goods that weren’t selling due to the pandemic’s influence on shopper’s needs. The company promised that its investments in online shopping options and its workforce — last week, for example, it raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour — would pay off in the long run.
“The speed and convenience of our fulfillment options are unmatched across the country, and theyve become even more critical for our guests searching for easy and safe ways to shop during the pandemic. By adding fresh grocery to the pickup services our guests already love, were giving them even more reasons to shop at Target, said Targets chief operating officer, John Mulligan, in a statement. “During a time when even more people are looking for different ways to get the items they need, well continue to invest in making Target the easiest and safest place to shop,” he added."

In response, some quarters of Silicon Valley are abuzz about a long-standing technology: reskilling, or training individuals to adopt an entirely new skillset or career for employment.
As millions look for a way to reenter the workforce, the question arises: Who really benefits from reskilling technology?
That depends on how you look at it, said Jomayra Herrera, a senior associate at Cowboy Ventures. Reskilling for a well-networked manager looks a lot different than it does for someone who doesn’t have as much leverage, and the vast majority of people fall into the latter. Not everyone has a friend at Google or Twitter to help them skip the online application and get right to the decision-makers.
Beyond the accessibility offered by live online classes, she pointed to the difference between assets and opportunities.
You can give someone access to something, but its not true access unless they have the tools and structure to really engage with it, Herrera said. In other words, how useful is content around reskilling if the company doesnt support job placement post-training.
Herrera said companies must give individuals opportunities to test skills with real work and navigate the career path. Her mother, who did not go to college and speaks English as a second language, is looking to pursue training online. Before she can proceed, however, she has to surmount hurdles like language support, resume creation, job search and other challenges.
All of a sudden, content feels like a commodity, regardless of if it has active and social learning components. Its part of the reason that MOOCs (massive open online courses) feel so stale.
Udacity, for example, was almost out of cash in 2018 and laid off more than half of its team in the past two years, according to The New York Times. Now, like other edtech companies, it is facing surges in usage."

The country’s Department for Transportation today announced that it would start allowing e-scooters, by way of e-scooter rental companies, to legally operate across the country initially in a trial phase starting no later than August. Some 50 councils and other authorities, including across London and other major cities, are working on putting together trials that could run for as long as 12 months.
The regulations come into force on July 4, the DfT said with the first trials expected to begin a week later.
“As we emerge from lockdown, we have a unique opportunity in transport to build back in a greener, more sustainable way that could lead to cleaner air and healthier communities across Great Britain,” said Transport Minister Rachel Maclean in a statement. “E-scooters may offer the potential for convenient, clean and cost-effective travel that may also help ease the burden on the transport network, provide another green alternative to get around and allow for social distancing. The trials will allow us to test whether they do these things.”
There are some restrictions in place: e-scooters will not be able to go faster than 15 miles per hour, and they will only be able to use roads and cycle lanes, not sidewalks or other areas reserved for pedestrians. Users will need a drivers license (full or provisional). The scooters themselves will not need to be registered as vehicles but will need insurance. And as with bicycles, users will be recommended — but not required — to wear helmets.
It seems that privately-owned e-scooters will not be included in the rule relaxation, but it’s not clear what steps regulators will take — if any — to avoid the cluttering that we have seen in some cities overrun with too many dock-less scooters crowding sidewalks.
The list of e-scooter hopefuls is long. From the word go, those that are looking to operate in the UK include Bird, Bolt (the ridesharing startup out of Estonia), Tier, Neuron Mobility, Lime, Voi, and Zipp Mobility.
We’re contacting the DfT with our questions and will update this post as we learn more.
Electric scooters will now join the ranks of other shared transportation options that include bikes and e-bikes, as a complement to mass transit and of course walking or using your own non-autonomotive wheels as an alternative to using cars. E-scooters have been seen both as an alternative for short distances (between 1 and 5 miles) but also as a last-mile solution in combination with 
The news today lifts restrictions that had previously been in place that classified e-scooters as motor vehicles and therefore required the e-scooters to be licensed and taxed, and for operators to have licenses to use them.
Those rules also meant that the e-scooters were illegal to use on sidewalks, with the only exception to all that being legal usage across select (and very limited) campuses on private land.
The moves comes on the heels of a consultation in March to pilot e-scooter use in three regions of the UK, along with a number of other initiatives including e-cargo carriers and using drones to transport medical supplies — the aim being to explore in quick order a number of new technologies to expand transportation options available to consumers, as well as essential businesses and the people who work in them.
The bigger trend has seen other cities also looking to relax rules to improve transportation options to people who wish to socially distance but still need to get around urban areas in ways that are quicker than walking. New York City is also expected to unveil its own roadmap for e-scooter pilots in the near future.
The news made official today had been something of a badly-kept secret, specifically among transportation startups whose businesses have been in a holding pattern waiting for the regulator to ease up on restrictions that had been in place.
Just about all of those startups have been sending out alerts to journalists for over a week now with comments on government’s widely-expected announcements.
We welcome the DfT’s announcement and are excited to be one step closer to the starting the e-scooter trials,” said Zachary Wang, CEO of Neuron Mobility, in a statement. “We are already in discussions with quite a few councils, as no two towns or cities are the same we look forward to partnering with them to safely introduce e-scooters in a way that best suits their individual needs. COVID-19 has led to a fundamental rethink of the way we travel and e-scooters have the potential to radically improve how we get around our towns and cities. We are delighted that people in the UK will soon be able to benefit from shared e-scooters, they will allow people to continue social distancing while also providing a more efficient travel option than gas-guzzling alternatives.”
Some have been gearing up for the green light for some time.
“We welcome todays announcement from the Government as it looks to get cities moving again safely and in an environmentally friendly way,” said Roger Hassan, COO of TIER Mobility, in a statement. “We already have more than 1,000 of our industry leading scooters in our UK warehouse, ready to be deployed and we will be shipping more over very soon. Everyone at TIER is looking forward to working with the Government and with local authorities to make e-scooters in the UK a huge success story.
While there had been restrictions in place before now, I should point out that they were often badly enforced: in London there have always been some private e-scooter owners zooming around alongside bikes and cars on the roads, and I’ve even stopped at red lights on my bike, with an e-scooter on one side of me, and a policeman on the other, and not a word gets exchanged, just a simple shrug of “what can you do?” So decriminalising, as it has done in other industries, will hopefully mean better oversight, alongside better choice for users."

Specifically in the job market, there have been millions of job losses, and in the US alone unemployment numbers like these have not been seen since the Great Depression. Now, tech companies are slowly stepping up to try to address the crisis, and the latest development on that front comes from Microsoft.
The company today announced a wide-ranging, global portal for free skills training for people who are out of work. And alongside that, Microsoft said it plans to disperse $20 million in grants to non-profit organizations, both which are working to help those who have lost jobs due to COVID-19 and subsequent shifts in the economy, and with a specific emphasis on those that are working with groups that are underrepresented in the tech world.
The move comes as we are seeing other tech companies try to make their own efforts to leverage their platforms to provide their own versions of relief efforts connected to COVID-19. Google has built special portals to keep people informed on local, national and global progress of COVID-19 and related news. Facebook has also built an information portal and has also created an avenue for people to offer volunteering help to those in need specifically in their community.
The money that Microsoft will be granting to non-profits is aimed at a wide swathe of organizations, not just those focused on helping groups learn new skills, but just those helping specific groups. Those that Microsoft already works with include Trust for the Americas, Fondazione Mundo Digitale in Italy, the Nasscom Foundation in India,  Tech4Dev across Africa, NPower in Canada, and the National Urban League aimed at long-term unemployed and African Americans, and Skillful.
The education and training news, meanwhile, is interesting not only because of the push that Microsoft is trying to make by leveraging the assets that it already has, but that it’s doing so in tandem with LinkedIn, the social network and professional education platform it acquired for $26.2 billion in 2016. Even though they are the same company, it’s often the case that you see less collaboration between the two than you might think would exist, but this seems to be a shift from that position.
Microsoft notes that using data from LinkedIn, it identified 10 specific tech jobs that are in particular demand right now and will continue to be in demand, offer a livable wage, and require skills that can be learned online if you don’t already have them. They are software developer, sales rep, project manager, IT admin, customer services rep, digital marketer, IT support, data analyst, financial analyst and graphic designer.
LinkedIn has designed “Learning Paths” that it offers through its online education portal for these jobs, and these will now be available to everyone free to use, globally, until the end of March 2021, in English, French, Spanish and German, with content getting updated in the tracks as needed. Alongside these, Microsoft Learn is offering supplemental technical content to these Paths, and Microsoft is also making GitHub’s Learning Lab free to practice if you’re learning software developer skills.
Alongside these, Microsoft is also giving a push to so-called “soft skills” that complement hunting for a job at the moment, including tips on looking for a job right now, learning “critical” soft skills, more on the concept and meaning of digital transformation, and a learning track focused on diversity, inclusion and allyship.
You can look at a list of all the content available and ultimately relevant jobs on LinkedIn’s purpose-built portal.
In addition to the online learning efforts, LinkedIn is also launching a separate track for those who want to either leverage LinkedIn to get spotted more easily for job opportunities, and for those who want to volunteer to help others, to offer advice and mentorship for those looking for work, or get more training to get through interviews. For those who want to signal their job seeking, they can now add an “OpenToWork” frame on their profile pictures, which links to a separate banner that runs under your profile picture which lets people see what kinds of jobs you would like to consider.
The offer to help is not unlike LinkedIn’s efforts at cultivating a mentorship program: the idea is that there are people who have the time and desire to use their skills to help others than just themselves and the companies they work for. As with the mentoring, those interested can indicate what they would like to do — making introductions, resume help or just providing advice.
LinkedIn’s interview preparations, meanwhile, are another step into working closer with Microsoft: LinkedIn’s built a set of tools that uses Microsoft’s AI platform for feedback throughout the training."

While the move to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic may have made them mainstream, they are not without issues and more and more people are now opting out. And for good reason. As it turns out, it’s really hard for our brains to sustain concentration while we’re trying to focus on 20 people in neat squares, all with different backgrounds and never quite looking at the camera. While we’ve had quite a bit of anecdotal evidence for this, Microsoft today released some of the research it did in this area, as well as new features in Teams that it hopes will make video meetings easier and less tiring.
The first of these is Together mode. The idea here is actually pretty simple. To be able to change backgrounds or add background blur, Teams already features Microsoft’s AI segmentation technology to detect and cut out a participant’s image from the background. Now, with Together Mode, it is taking everybody’s images and putting them into a shared space, starting with an auditorium. So instead of lots of little squares, all of the meeting participants now sit in this auditorium. This, Microsoft’s research shows, is actually quite a bit easier on the brain to process than standard remote collaboration tools.
“In our preliminary research — and it’s only been preliminary thus far, this has only been around for a couple of months — we’ve noticed quite a few things,” Microsoft’s Melissa Salazar explained to me ahead of today’s announcement. “First and foremost, you’ll notice the way that we’re looking at each other is obviously very different than something we’re used to, not only are we out of the grid, but we’re looking at this, ‘mirror image’ of ourselves.” This view of ourselves, Microsoft argues, is something we’re quite used to from being at the barbershop, for example, where we talk to the mirror. This also tricks our brain into mitigating some of the eye contact problems we’ve all experienced in video meetings.
“Our research has also shown that people tend to be happier, be more engaged in meetings, feel more comfortable keeping their camera on longer — even if they’re not asked to in this mode. And then — I think most importantly — be able to pick up on the behavioral social cues that are so important to human interaction,” said Salazar.
Michael Bohan, a director in Microsofts Human Factors Engineering group, noted that just removing the grid view already makes a major difference here. “When you have a grid view, everybody’s boxed off and so your brain has to treat those as individual parts — it has to parse all information. When you remove those edges, then your brain can start to see a more unified view of things.”
For now, Together Mode only features the auditorium view, which can handle up to 49 participants, but Microsoft is already working on other views, including a more intimate coffee shop mode.
The other new mode Microsoft is introducing is Dynamic view. The idea here is that Together Mode is obviously not perfect for every kind of meeting, so this view provides more control over how you see shared content and the other participants in a meeting, including the ability to see content and specific participants side-by-side.
Also new in this update are video filters, to tweak your lighting levels, for example, and soon, Teams will add live reactions, which let you share your sentiment with emojis without interrupting the meeting. Coming soon, too, are PowerPoint Live Presentations to Teams, chat bubbles so you don’t have to keep a separate chat view open, and speaker attribution and translation for live captions and transcripts. For chats in teams, Microsoft is introducing Gmail-like suggested replies.
But there is more. Teams will soon let you bring the whole company together, with meetings that can support up to 1,000 participants. And for presentations, Teams will support up to 20,000 participants.
And since Cortana still lives, she is also now coming to the Teams mobile app to help you make calls, join meetings and more.
Microsoft also today re-introduced its dedicated Team Displays which it first announced at CES.
Another new feature Microsoft CVP Jared Spataro stressed when I talked to him ahead of today’s announcement was the new Reflect messaging extension. “This allows you to have a manager check in on the wellbeing of your team,” he explained. “You can do that anonymously or publicly. We’ve already been doing some of that on my team — just trying to check in with people — and this gives you a more structured way to do that. I think it’ll be really well received based on what I’m talking about with customers because this well-being  component is becoming very important.”

The company just made it under the pre-COVID-19 shutdown wire back in February for the Galaxy S20 launch.
The headliner of next months event will no doubt be the next version of Samsungs popular phablet line. The Galaxy Note S20 has leaked online a fair bit already, because Samsung. The most notable occasion was the beginning of the month, when the companys Russia site briefly posted a copper colored version of the Note 20 Ultra. Fitting, the invite for the event features a copper S-Pen dripping into a big similarly-colored puddle. 
The premium version of the handset sports a folded zoom lens, much like the Galaxy S20 Ultra. Additional leaks appear to confirm some minor changes to the handsets design, including the swapping of some buttons and moving the S-Pen slot to the left of the charging port. Other details will almost certainly leak out between now and August 5, because thats just how these things go. There will likely be a slew of other devices on the docket for the event, as well. Samsung likes to pack a lot into Unpacked, after all. Accessories, audio products and wearables are all candidates. 
Notably, Samsung also announced that it will be holding its own virtual event in the early September timeframe. The company had initially planned to attend IFA, but ultimately and understandably thought better of it. The August 5 event, meanwhile, kicks off at 10AM ET/7 AM PT.

Smartphone shipments in India fell 48% in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, the most drastic drop one of the rare growing markets has seen in a decade, research firm Canalys reported Friday evening.
About 17.3 million smartphone units shipped in Q2 2020, down from 33 million in Q2 2019, and 33.5 million in Q1 2020, the research firm said.
You can blame coronavirus for it.
New Delhi ordered a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the spread of the virus that saw all shops across the country — save for some of those that sell grocery items and pharmacies — temporarily cease operation. Even e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Flipkart were prohibited from selling smartphones and other items classified as non-essential by the government.
The protracted lockdown lasted until mid-May after which the Indian government deemed that other stores and e-commerce deliveries could resume their services in much of country. New Delhi’s stringent measure explains why India’s smartphone market dipped so heavily.
China, the world’s largest smartphone market, in comparison saw only an 18% drop in shipments in the quarter that ended in March — the period when the country was most impacted by the virus. In Q1, when India was largely not impacted by the virus, smartphone shipments grew by 4% in the country. (Globally, smartphone shipments shrank by 13% in Q1 — a figure that is projected to only slightly improve to a  12% decline this year.)
“It’s been a rocky road to recovery for the smartphone market in India,” said Madhumita Chaudhary, an analyst at Canalys. “While vendors witnessed a crest in sales as soon as markets opened, production facilities struggled with staffing shortages on top of new regulations around manufacturing, resulting in lower production output.”
Smartphone shipment estimates for the Indian market through Q1 2019 to Q1 2020 (Canalys)
Despite the lockdown, Xiaomi maintained its dominance in India. The Chinese smartphone vendor, which has been the top smartphone vendor in India since late 2018, shipped 5.3 million smartphone units in the quarter that ended in June this year and commanded 30.9% of the local market, Canalys estimated.
With 3.7 million units shipment and 21.3% market share in India, Vivo retained the second spot. Samsung, which once ruled the Indian smartphone market and has made major investments in the country in recent months, settled for the third spot with 16.8% share.
Nearly every smartphone vendor has launched new handsets in India in recent weeks as they look to recover from the downtime and several more new smartphone launches are planned in the next one month.
But for some of these players the virus is not the only obstacle.
Anti-China sentiment has been gaining mindshare in India in recent months ever since more than 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a military clash in the Himalayas in June. Boycott China and variations of it has been trending on Twitter in India as a number of people posted videos destroying Chinese-made smartphones, TVs and other products. Late last month, India also banned 59 apps and services developed by Chinese firms.
Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, which now assumes the fourth spot in India, and other Chinese smartphone vendors command nearly 80% of the smartphone market in India.
Canalys’ Chaudhary, however, believes that these smartphone firms will be able to largely avoid the backlash as “alternatives by Samsung, Nokia, or even Apple are hardly price-competitive.”
Apple, which commands only 1% of the Indian smartphone market, was the least impacted among the top 10 vendors as iPhone shipments fell just 20% year-on-year to over 250,000 in Q2 2020, Canalys said."

After all, prior downturns in the broader economy, and tech sector in particular, had taken a bite out of the ability for startups to attract new funds.
PitchBook research shows that, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the amount of money venture capitalists invested fell, with early-stage deal and dollar volume enduring the largest cuts. Late-stage valuations during the same period came under steep pressure. The connection between a slipping economy and a rapidly deteriorating venture capital market, therefore, seems strong.
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. You can read it every morning on Extra Crunch, and now you can receive it in your inbox. Sign up for The Exchange newsletter, which drops every Friday starting July 24.
The historically-grounded feeling from startups in Q2, as the stock market sold off and unemployment rose, was one of concern: VCs were about to cut their deal pace, and the number of dollars that they were willing to put into each deal would likely fall as well. Throw in the fact that investors would need to shake up their process and do deals remotely, was not confidence inspiring.
We don’t have full Q2 VC numbers yet, so it’s too soon to say that Q2 was worse, or better than expectations. But what we can say, thanks to a new survey from OMERS Ventures, is that VCs moved with reasonable speed to get over the technology and cultural hurdle of remote-dealmaking to keep the checks flowing. Indeed, according to OMERS Ventures’ research, 69% of the VCs it surveyed in June were willing to do fully-remote deals; for startups worried that the venture class was simply going to pack up its checkbook and take an extended vacation, it’s good news.
But the news isn’t all rosy — most VC firms from the 150 in North America and Europe that the venture group surveyed have yet to actually execute a remote deal. And, there’s some indication that overall deal volume could be slowing, perhaps due to “dwindling supply of companies formally going to market,” according to OMERS Ventures’ Damien Steel, a managing partner.
This morning let’s examine which VCs have been the most active, and the least, to find out which types of firms are still investing, and where investors are seeing more deal flow, and less.
Most VCs have decided that remote dealmaking is, at minimum, something that they need to become accustomed to. Only 4% of surveyed VCs said that they would not do remote deals, full-stop. Another 23% said that they were find with remote deals, albeit with some ability to meet entrepreneurs in person."

In several states, new hotspots have rolled back plans to reopen businesses. The novel coronavirus has and will continue to profoundly impact the way we live and work. 
For the moment, that includes a shift in the employment status of many Americans. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment since mid-March. And while many states have made efforts to reopen businesses and return some sense of normality, these moves have led to a spike in cases and may prolong the pandemic and its ongoing economic impact. 
Technology has been a lifeline for many, from food delivery to the 3D printing I highlighted last week, which has worked to address a nation suffering from personal protective equipment shortages. Automation and robotics have also been a constant in conversations around techs battle against COVID-19. 
Robots dont get sick, tired or emotionally burnt out, and unlike us, they arent walking, talking disease vectors. Automation advocates like to point to the three Ds of dull, dirty and dangerous jobs that will eventually be replaced by a robotic workforce, but in the age of COVID-19, nearly any essential job qualifies. 
The robotic invasion has already begun in earnest. The service, delivery, health care and sanitation industries in particular have all opened a massive gap over the past several months that automation has been more than happy to roll right through. A recent report from The Brookings Institute notes that automation arrives in the workforce in fits and starts most notably, during times of economic downturn. 
“Robots infiltration of the workforce doesnt occur at a steady, gradual pace. Instead, automation happens in bursts, concentrated especially in bad times such as in the wake of economic shocks, when humans become relatively more expensive as firms revenues rapidly decline,” the study found. “At these moments, employers shed less-skilled workers and replace them with technology and higher-skilled workers, which increases labor productivity as a recession tapers off.”"

Today, MariaDB Corporation, the company behind MariaDB SkySQL and one of the startups leading the charge on open source cloud databases, is announcing $25 million in funding to continue its growth.
The money is coming in the form of an extension to the company’s Series C round, and it’s being led by SmartFin Capital, a Belgian VC, with participation also from previous investor GP Bullhound.
(Side note: extensions to existing rounds seem to have become more frequent in recent months. That’s in part because extensions can be faster to close than opening and closing completely new rounds; in part because they are typically smaller amounts; and in part because fundraising has become a lot more challenging and harder to do in recent months, with people travelling and meeting in person much less, and sometimes not at all.)
Notably, however, being an extension doesn’t mean the valuation is not changing. This latest infusion brings the total raised by MariaDB Corp. to over $125 million, “doubling our valuation,” CEO Michael Howard noted in a statement.
Howard didn’t reveal the exact figure of that valuation, but for some context, the company — founded in Helsinki, Finland and now co-headquartered in Redwood City, CA — was last valued at 300 million ($340 million at today’s rates) in 2017, in a $27 million round led by Alibaba. That would put today’s round at a 600 million ($680 million), a big leap for the the startup — and for open source — in the space of three years.
Part of the boost for MariaDB’s business is coming directly as a result of the demands we’re seeing in the enterprise sector today for database-as-a-service tools built on cloud and open source architecture, Howard noted.
Expanding MariaDB SkySQL cloud operations is our key focus,” Howard said in a statement. “There is an addressable and immediate market need with a growing number of companies who want to enable faster innovation and agility by adopting cloud technologies and shifting database management to DBaaS solutions.”
MariaDB says that DBS Bank, ServiceNow, Walgreens, Samsung and more than 75% of the Fortune 500 customers run MariaDB in both private and public clouds, speaking to the reach of the platform.
MariaDB Corp. is not disclosing its own growth numbers — we’re asking and will update as and when we learn more — but it’s likely they have been strong, judging by the valuation hike.
MariaDB continues to exceed our expectations, said Jürgen Ingels, founding partner, SmartFin Capital, in a statement. The companys innovation in cloud database technology will help support the rapid growth in IT modernization that businesses large and small are pursuing to keep up with the world around us. We feel MariaDB is well-positioned to take a large share of the growing cloud database market as companies continue to push forward into the cloud. We are proud to invest more in MariaDB to continue their exceptional growth.
Apart from the more immediate effects of the health pandemic, MariaDB Corp’s growth speaks to other trends in enterprise IT that have been in play for years.
Gartner estimates that 75% of all databases will have migrated to cloud architectures by 2022 either with all-in or hybrid deployments, “with only 5% ever considered for repatriation to on-premises.”
While MariaDB remains committed to open source — indeed there is a MariaDB Foundation that includes members like Microsoft, Booking.com, Tencent and Alibaba — MariaDB Corp has positioned itself as something of a consolidator in terms of building commercial services on top of the open source relational database. Its acquisitions have included Clustrix and MammothDB to expand its functionality, and this funding will be used to that end as well, particularly around scaling and improving the speed of SkySQL.
MariaDB has risen to be a household name in the IT industry, said Per Roman, co-founder and managing partner of GP Bullhound in a statement. We have been particularly interested in MariaDB’s focus on bringing its flexibility, security and stability to the cloud. Thats why were excited to invest in MariaDB, as we see enormous opportunities for its SkySQL product."

The Facebook-owned messaging behemoth is expanding the reach and use of QR codes to let customers easily connect with businesses on the platform, providing them also with a series of stickers to kick off “we’re open for business” campaigns; and it’s made it possible for businesses to start sharing WhatsApp-based catalogs — dynamic lists of items that can in turn be ordered by users — as links outside of the WhatsApp platform itself.
The moves come at WhatsApp’s business efforts pass some significant milestones.
WhatsApps’ profile as a formal platform for doing business is growing, albeit slowly. The WhatsApp Business app — used by merchants to interface with customers over WhatsApp and use the platform to market themselves — now has 50 million monthly active users, with its two biggest markets for the service India at over 15 million MAUs and Brazil at over 5 million MAUs. Catalogs specifically has 40 million users.
On the other hand, WhatsApp has hit some stumbling blocks with features it’s tried to put into place to grow those numbers faster and boost usage among businesses.
Specifically, last month WhatsApp launched payments in Brazil, its first market, aimed not just at users sending each other money but merchants selling goods and services over the platform. But just nine days later, Brazilian regulators blocked the service over competition concerns, and it has yet to be restored pending further review. (India, which many had thought would be the first market for payments, is now part of a bigger global roadmap for rolling out payments.)
To put WhatsApp Business app’s usage numbers into some context, WhatsApp itself passed 2 billion users in February of this year. In that regard, hitting 50 million MAUs of the WhatsApp business app in the two years since it’s launched doesn’t sound like a whole lot (and in particular considering that it has competitors like Google offering payment services to merchants). Still, there has always been a lot of informal usage of the app, especially by smaller merchants, and that speaks to monetising potential if they can be lured into more of WhatsApps’ — and Facebook’s — products.
All the more reason that Facebook is expanding other features to make WhatsApp more useful for businesses, and especially smaller businesses — capitalising on a moment when many of them are turning to numerous digital channels (some for the first time ever) like social media, messaging services, websites and third-party delivery platforms to get their products and services out to the masses, in a period when visiting physical storefronts has been severely curtailed because of the health pandemic.
QR codes got a little boost last week from WhatsApp on the consumer side, with the company introducing a way for contacts to swap details for the first time by sharing codes rather than manually entering phone numbers — not unlike Snap Codes and shortcuts for adding contacts created on other social apps. That is now getting the business treatment.
Now, if you need to reach a business for customer support, to ask a question or order something, instead of manually entering a business phone number, you can scan a QR code from a receipt, a business display at the storefront, a product, or even posted on the web, in order to connect with the company. Businesses that are using these can also set up welcome messages to start conversations once they’ve been added by a user. (They will have to use the WhatsApp Business app or the WhatsApp Business API to do this, of course.)
The catalog sharing feature, meanwhile, is an expansion on a feature that the company first launched in November 2019, which will now allow businesses to create and share links to their catalogs to post elsewhere. To be frank, the lack of ability to share catalogs at launch felt like a feature omission, considering that businesses often use multiple channels to market themselves, although it might have been an intentional move: there has long been questions about how tight links are between Facebook and WhatsApp, so slowly introducing features that share and cross-market from the start might be the preferred route for the company.
The idea now will be the those links can now be shared on Facebook, Instagram and other places.
Although all of these services, and WhatsApp Business remain free to use, they continue to lay the groundwork for how Facebook might monetise the features in the future, not least through payments but also through stronger pushes to advertise on Facebook, now with more ways of linking a company’s WhatsApp profile to those ads."

Tesla still managed to beat expectations despite the headwinds.
The vast majority of deliveries some 80,050 were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The remaining 10,600 were its more expensive Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla doesn’t provide break downs of each model separately nor does it give information about regional deliveries.
Analysts, who had anticipated lower numbers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had varying forecasts with some predicting as few as 39,000 deliveries and as many as 83,000. A consensus of analysts surveyed by FaceSet expected Tesla to deliver 72,000 vehicles in the second quarter.
The results pushed shares up nearly 10% in pre-market trading $1,221.85 Thursday morning.
Here’s a quick breakdown:

Tesla also reduced the prices of its vehicles in China and North America. Both strategies aimed to spur demand for its electric vehicles.
Tesla shares popped Wednesday after the market opened and pushed the company’s market capitalization to nearly $208 billion, surpassing Toyota  to become the worlds most valuable automaker by market value. The shares rose in part on reports of a companywide email from CEO Elon Musk congratulating employees on reaching its sales and production goals."

O’Donnell was part of the early wave of urban tech innovation, which began to rise about six years ago. He co-founded Intersection, a company manufacturing digital kiosks for public transportation services, which was eventually rolled up in one of the first big acquisitions from the Alphabet-owned subsidiary Sidewalk Labs .
While the initial optimism for — and interest in — technology’s ability to reshape the built environment has stumbled thanks to both Sidewalk’s data collection overreach in its initial Toronto project and the financial stresses that the COVID-19 epidemic has placed on cities across the country, experiments with how to integrate technology into society more intelligently continue on the margins. And investments in real estate technology continue to rise.
O’Donnell’s new company, Kibbo, takes advantage of both trends. The San Francisco-based startup aims to upgrade the American trailer park, making it a network of intentional communities for the remote-working, previously urban professionals (PUPs?).
To ensure that these remote working puppies (I’m going with it) can navigate the American roadways in the manner to which they’re accustomed, Kibbo pitches exclusive RV parks outfitted with amenities like kitchen supplies and basic staples like coffee and snacks, a gym and recreational facilities for congregating. The company is now taking applications for membership and will be charging $1,000 per month to access its locations of sites near major national parks across the West Coast.
For members who don’t have their own vehicles, Kibbo offers access to top-of-the-line Mercedes Sprinters outfitted with the latest in #vanlife amenities. The vans cost roughly $1,000 per month to rent.
Beginning in the fall, members who get past Kibbo’s virtual velvet rope and gain access to the company’s communities will be able to visit spots in Ojai, Zion, Black Rock Desert and Big Sur. Those locations will be complemented by spots in urban cores in Los Angeles, San Francisco and somewhere in Silicon Valley, according to a statement from O’Donnell.
With the pressure of months of quarantine fueling the desire for people to get out of their expensive apartments in the city to explore nature and connect with people, we now have the demand and opportunity to rethink how we live, work, have fun, and find meaning,” he said. “We get to rethink the urban experience and define what we want cities of the future to really look like.
With Kibbo’s launch, would-be puppies (still going with it) attracted to its vision of a network of community spaces shared by professionals whose companies have embraced remote work, can now pay $100 to apply to be part of the network.
The company is tapping in to a part of the American zeitgeist that’s nearly as old as the country itself. From its inception, people came (and colonized) the country in an effort to create communities that would reflect their values and beliefs and afford them an opportunity to flourish (at the expense of others).
It’s also working off of the glamping phenomenon that netted HipCamp a valuation over $100 million and grabbed Tentrr an $11 million round of financing. HipCamp offers a database of campsites that earns money by taking a commission from the bookings it facilitates to over 300,000 sites across the U.S.
Like Tentrr, Kibbo is using private land to set up sites accessible to membership. But unlike Tentrr, Kibbo owns its own real estate and is setting up its sites to be part of a community rather than just an experience for travelers looking for a different option from a city vacation or competing for campsites at national parks.
Kibbo also thinks of itself as developing a new kind of roving cities comprised of a certain kind of membership.
Unlike, traditional top-down designed and built real estate developments, Kibbo is setting out to build the first of the next generation of cities: flexible, reconfigurable, designed and defined by the people that live in it, off the grid and sustainable,” O’Donnell said. 
That’s what attracted Urban.us investor Shaun Abrahamson.
“In the short and medium term, I think this looks like a specialty part of the RV market. However, our sense is that RV experience was designed for vacations or retirees and trends like remote work and van life suggest there is demand for different kind of infrastructure and experience… Our longer term interest is climate and affordable housing,” Abrahamson said.  
Climate change and the resulting flooding, fires and rising sea levels are going to change the kinds of infrastructure to support permanent housing, Abrahamson said.
“Van life is benefitting from mobile infrastructure — solar + batteries make off-grid easier. As prices come down, mobile housing and infrastructure will become more attractive. And Kibbo is filling in other lightweight pieces of infrastructure related to things like sanitation and security and, yes, theyll layer in experiences, too,” he said.  
Both Abrahamson and O’Donnell think there will be more nomadic communities far beyond vacations and retirement, and Kibbo is the firm’s attempt to tap into that trend. It’s a vision for a future of cities that doesn’t include them, and one that O’Donnell, a New York transplant living in a communal space in San Francisco, embraces.
While Kibbo offers an exciting lifestyle from day one, were making a bet that the future of cities is electric, autonomous, distributed, renewable and user-generated,” O’Donnell said."

What follows is a survey of some of the top VCs in the state and how they see COVID-19 affecting the growth of Detroit, Ann Arbor and all of Michigan’s startup ecosystem. According to the Michigan Venture Capital Association (MVCA), there are 144 venture-backed startup companies in Michigan, which is an increase of 12% over the last five years.
The amount of capital available in the state hit a four-year high in 2019 after shrinking from record levels in 2015. The MVCA says the total amount of VC funds under management in Michigan is $4.3 billion. Out of that, 71% of the capital has been invested into companies and the MVCA states its members estimate an additional $1.2 billion of venture capital is needed to “adequately fund the growth of Michigans 144 startup companies in the next two years.”
As the VCs say below, life sciences is a large part of the Michigan ecosystem, attracting 38% of all investments made in the state. Information technology comes in second, receiving 34% of the total capital invested, with 85% going to those focused on software. Mobility, often thought as Michigan’s mainstay, only received 7% of the capital in 2019. Here’s who we spoke to:
<ul><li>Chris Stallman, partner, Fontinalis Partners</li><li>Patricia Glaza, EVP and managing director, ID Ventures</li><li>Chris Rizik, CEO and fund manager, Renaissance Venture Capital</li><li>Tim Streit, partner, Grand Ventures</li><li>Turner Novak, general partner, Gelt VC</li></ul>VCs remain bullish on Michigan’s life science startups
Michigan has long been a hub for life science startups and the venture capitalists polled expect that to continue. Chris Stallman of Fontinalis Partners points to Michigan’s long-standing reputation in this field and expects this to continue.
Tim Streit of Grand Ventures agrees and sees the pandemic as accelerating the sector’s growth. In recent weeks he says his firm has seen a “number of promising digital therapeutics deals based in or near Michigan and the timing couldnt be more perfect for these kinds of companies to succeed.”
Chris Rizik of Renaissance Venture Capital notes that drug development will continue to drive growth around the country and is a strength of the Michigan ecosystem. He also points to Jeff Williams, CEO of NeuMoDx, as a leader in the life science community and who has led a number of Michigan’s most successful startups.
The notable exception to this are startups directly serving hospitals, according to Patricia Glaza of ID Ventures. She sees this as a challenging market in the era of COVID-19, saying “Hospitals are bleeding cash without elective surgeries and hard to prioritize nonessential technologies.”
Ann Arbor is becoming a hub for security companies
Duo Security’s impressive exit to Cisco in 2018 is still resonating in the scene. As such, many venture capitalists are seeing Ann Arbor becoming a home for security startups.
Stallman of Fontinalis states, “I think the cybersecurity realm will be a bright spot as some of those spillover effects from the 2018 acquisition of Duo Security by Cisco take hold (this is still in its early days employees will reach the end of their employment agreements and will start new companies, etc.).” Rizik of Renaissance Venture Capital said something similar: “The success of Duo Security highlighted Michigans growing reputation as a cybersecurity hub. The University of Michigan has always been strong in this area, and we now see a number of interesting startups in this field popping up around Ann Arbor.”
When asked about leaders in the Michigan startup scene, nearly all of the VCs listed Duo Security founders Dug Song and Jon Oberheide as key players. Perhaps Rizik said it best: “Dug Song is a great leader, who not only created a monster success for the region with Duo Security, but also has devoted much of his time to strategically working to help Michigan move forward as a responsible, startup-friendly community.”
Michigan is well-suited to benefit from remote work
Of course Michigan-based venture capitalists would be bullish on their own state, but nearly all of the VCs share the same reasons on why Michigan is a good place. They list low cost of living, amazing STEM-focused schools and a community of founders, VCs and business leaders eager to help each other.
Few VCs mention mobility as a bright spot for Michigan startups
Surprisingly, few of the VCs in the survey mention mobility or automotive as a highlight of the Michigan startup scene, which runs counter to the national narrative. Stallman sums up the situation this way: “The mobility space will see both headwinds and tailwinds. Companies vying for automotive customers may find that the industrys challenges have resulted in a shorter ‘priority list’ for many automakers and suppliers; on the other side, companies helping to remove enterprise risk through innovation in supply chain, automation, workforce efficiency, etc. will have arguably more opportunity going forward.”
Chris Stallman, partner, Fontinalis Partners
How much is local investing a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
We have always been a thematically focused investor rather than a geographically focused investor; prior to COVID-19, we had invested 99% of our capital outside of Michigan. With that said, wed love to invest more in Michigan and support more local founders.
What do you expect to happen to the startup climate in Detroit/Ann Arbor/Michigan longer term, with the shift to more remote work, possibly from more remote areas. Will it stay a tech hub?
Southeast Michigan has always been a story of two different startup worlds: health/life sciences and hardware/software tech. On the life sciences side, this region has a long-standing reputation of innovation and university research, and I expect that to remain largely the same going forward. It would seem to me that life sciences companies may not have as easy of a time adapting to new remote-work environments since much of the innovation work remains lab/clinic/facility-based.
For the world of other technology, I think there will certainly be more embracing of remote work and distributed teams this area has always had some degree of that since its not uncommon to see companies with another office elsewhere or a few remote employees that come from very specific backgrounds that are hard to recruit for locally. Since this area has always had some of that, I could see a case that this new paradigm will be an easier adjustment for this region. However, the flip side of that is that so much of tech innovation and developing an ecosystem is about density and serendipitous collisions for an area that was still on the come-up, losing what ground had been gained in recent years will no doubt make the spillover benefits of this aspect harder to come by. I worry a bit that angel and seed activity will slow locally (and hopefully that the growth in seed funds nationally will offset that).
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
I think a larger theme that is arising out of this COVID-19 situation is that people have a heightened sense of health, safety and security. Life sciences will remain resilient so long as theres funding for continued research, and I think the cybersecurity realm will be a bright spot as some of those spillover effects from the 2018 acquisition of Duo Security by Cisco take hold (this is still in its early days employees will reach the end of their employment agreements and will start new companies, etc.).
The mobility space will see both headwinds and tailwinds. Companies vying for automotive customers may find that the industrys challenges have resulted in a shorter priority list for many automakers and suppliers; on the other side, companies helping to remove enterprise risk through innovation in supply chain, automation, workforce efficiency, etc. will have arguably more opportunity going forward.
In the short term, what challenges are facing Michigans startup scene?
Detroit has not yet hit a full critical mass from a startup ecosystem standpoint, and that is most evident in the more limited amount of angel and seed capital available to companies here; and, to a lesser extent, a more shallow pool of mentors and advisors for founders than what you would find in SF, LA, NYC, Boston, etc.
Who are some founders (who youve invested in or otherwise) that are leaders in the community?
Here are some of the prominent ones (note that we have invested in any): Dug Song and Jon Oberheide (Duo Security), Mina Sooch (has founded and led several prominent biotech companies), Amanda Lewan (Bamboo Detroit), Kyle Hoff (Floyd), Josh Luber and Greg Schwartz (StockX).
A lot of Bay Area founders and developers are looking to relocate. Why Michigan?
Quality research institutions, access to talent locally and ability to pull from Toronto/Ohio/etc., significant industry (automotive, logistics, manufacturing and financial services) in its footprint, supportive state programs for startups, cost of living, international airport with easy access (when the world moves again, that is), etc.

The company smashed Wall Street expectations delivering Q3 revenue of $59.69 billion, beating down the $52.25 billion analysts had expected. The company also announced earnings per share of $2.58 compared to Wall Street expectation of $2.04 EPS.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Apple’s overall revenue was up nearly 11% year-over-year, reflecting the boom that broader tech stocks have seen as of late. The company’s year-over-year revenues were up in every geography it measures and every product category it measures.
Apple’s stock was up as much as 5% in after-hours trading as investors reacted to the earnings release.
Apples record June quarter was driven by double-digit growth in both Products and Services and growth in each of our geographic segments, said CEO Tim Cook in a statement accompanying the release. In uncertain times, this performance is a testament to the important role our products play in our customers lives and to Apples relentless innovation.”
Alongside the news, Apple detailed that they would be doing a four-for-one stock split, indicating that investors who already own one share of Apple stock will receive three more. This doesn’t materially change much for investors, but does ensure that single shares of Apple stock will be more affordable when the stock split is carried out toward the end of August. This isn’t a first for the company, they’ve done it several times, most recently back in 2014.
This was Apple’s first quarterly earnings report that fully felt the damage of COVID-19 and worldwide changes to in-person retail amid wide shelter-in-place mandates by governments. These seismic shifts have clearly not damaged Apple’s stock which hit an all-time high this month and already appears on its way towards breaking through a $2 trillion market cap.
The company had its first fully remote developer conference earlier this summer where they debuted the next wave of their device operating systems. The company is expected to release a flurry of new mobile devices in upcoming months as per their historic device release schedule.
Yesterday, CEO Tim Cook was Zoom-summoned to an antitrust hearing in Washington, D.C. where he was questioned about anti-competitive practices alongside other Big Tech CEOs."

We’ve been tracking the Jamf IPO for some time, as it is yet another example of a technology company worth $1 billion or more going public during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Back in March, we’d have guessed that today’s IPO market would be devoid of any public offerings, let alone a litany of successful flotations. But, 2020 is unpredictable; instead of seeing an IPO drought, there have been a modest deluge of debuts.
And yesterday Jamf continued the trend of recent IPO pricing strongly, at times selling more shares in the bargain.

Jamf’s IPO underscores that public market investors are hungry for new technology offerings and keen on growth but are willing to accept what startups would consider middling expansion and sufficiently greedy to pay up both before and after a company begins to trade.
This is the IPO market that unicorns were waiting for.
Happily, more companies — and let’s be so bold as to say unicorns — could approach the public markets in short order. The Exchange spoke with Wouter Witvoet, CEO of startup equity service provider Secfi, yesterday to get his view on today’s IPO market and coming offerings. Sitting as he does between growing startups and their vested employees, Secfi has a fascinating lens into the maturity of the firms we discuss when we talk about future IPOs.
On the subject of companies going public today with strong pricing runs, Witvoet said that “what you’re seeing is that IPOs have dried up for a very long time, and people want to deploy cash.” More cash means more dollars chasing IPOs, which helps explain the current pricing cycles we’ve seen. Witvoet cited Palantir as a company that is “making use of the opportunity that there is somewhat of an IPO window now to go public,” going on to say that he had expected Snowflake to stay private longer, but that it instead opted to start its own IPO process, perhaps due to attractive market conditions."

Levandowski wont be heading straight to prison, however. Judge William Alsup postponed his incarceration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He will report to prison at a future date yet to be determined.
Judge Alsup said that home confinement would [give] a green light to every future brilliant engineer to steal trade secrets. Prison time is the answer to that.
During court proceedings today, Levandowski also agreed to pay $756,499.22 in restitution to Google and a fine of $90,000.
The U.S. District Attorney’s office had recommended a 27-month sentence arguing in court today that Levandowski had committed the crime for ego or greed, and that he remained a wealthy man. 
It was wrong for him to take all of these files, and it erases the contributions of many, many other people that have also put their blood, sweat and tears into this project that makes a safer self-driving car, prosecutor Katherine Wawrzyniak said in her closing statement. When someone as brilliant as Mr Levandowski and as focused on his mission to create self driving cars to make the world safer and better, and that somehow excuses his actions, thats wrong.
Levandowski had sought a fine, 12 months home confinement and 200 hours of community service. 
Levandowski spoke briefly on his behalf: The last three and a half years have forced me to come to terms with what I did. I want to take this time to apologize to my colleagues at Google for betraying their trust, and to my entire family for the price they have paid and will continue to pay for my actions.
The sentencing is the latest in a series of legal blows that have seen Levandowski vilified as a thieving tech bro, unceremoniously ejected from Uber, and forced into bankruptcy by a $179 million award against him.
And yet, Levandowski is not skulking away. Even as he faced more than two years in prison, the maverick engineer was plotting a comeback that could see him netting upwards of $4 billion from Uber. 
TechCrunch has learned that Levandowski recently filed a lawsuit making explosive claims against Waymo and Uber that, if proven, could turn his fortunes around with a multi-billion dollar payout. [Whether this is a last-ditch effort by a desperate man whose career has been upended by his own poor choices or a viable claim against a double-dealing tech titan, will be up to the courts to decide.
This new lawsuit, filed as part of Levandowskis bankruptcy proceedings, mostly focuses on Ubers agreement to indemnify Levandowski against legal action when it bought his self-trucking company, Otto Trucking. It also includes new allegations concerning the settlement that Waymo and Uber reached over trade secret theft claims. 
No new comment on this most recent desperate filing, an Uber spokesperson said in an email.
The quick backstory 
The criminal case that led to Levandowskis sentencing Tuesday, as well as related civil proceedings and this new lawsuit, are part of a multi-year legal saga that has entangled Levandowksi, Uber and Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet.
Levandowski was an engineer and one of the founding members in 2009 of the Google self-driving project, which was internally called Project Chauffeur. Levandowski was paid about $127 million by Google for his work on Project Chauffeur, according to the court documents.
In 2016, Levandowski left Google and started Otto with three other Google veterans:Lior Ron,Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later.
Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasnt a party to either arbitration. However, under the indemnification agreement between Uber and Levandowski, the company was compelled to defend him.
While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.
Under the settlement, Uber agreed to not incorporate Waymos confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That calculated at the time to about $244.8 million in Uber equity.
Startling allegations in new lawsuit
This history matters because it is at the center of this new lawsuit that Levandowski filed in July.
He claims that the terms of the Uber-Waymo settlement which have never been made public – included an agreement that Uber would never hire or work with him again. Levandowski says that resulted in Uber also reneging on its promises to support his trucking business. 
At closing of the Otto acquisition, an earnout plan would have given its owners a percent interest of billions in profit for Ubers new trucking business, the lawsuit alleges. Levandowski would be made a non-executive chairman and control the new trucking business. Alternatively, Uber could decline to close on the transaction but instead grant Levandowski an exclusive license to Ottos and Ubers self-driving technology.
The lawsuit says that neither occurred, and that Uber threatened to leave the transaction in limbo and force Mr. Levandowski to engage in protracted litigation to enforce his rights underthe Otto Trucking Merger Agreement. Uber then coerced Mr. Levandowski to resign from Otto Trucking and to sell his interest in the company at a significant discount, the lawsuit alleges.
The upshot: Levandowski believes and claims in the lawsuit that he should be awarded earnouts associated with the profits of Uber Freight  the new name of Otto Trucking  an amount that should be at least $4.128 billion. Uber made Uber Freight a separate business unit in August 2018. It has since set up a headquarters in Chicago and pursued an aggressive expansion even as it suffers losses. Bloomberg recently reported Uber Freight was seeking investment at a valuation of $4BN. In short, Levandowski wants the whole company. 
In addition, Levandowski hopes to force Uber to pay the $179 million sum that was awarded to Google in arbitration. (Google, for its part, is keen for Levandowski to prevail. A filing it made in the new lawsuit states: [Levandowski] cannot come close to fully repaying Google (or his other creditors) in this bankruptcy without recovering on his indemnification claim against Uber.)
The lawsuit also contains the remarkable accusation that Levandowski may not have been the only Google employee to take the companys self-driving car secrets with them when they left. It notes an independent expert found that Ubers self-driving software contained problematic functions that might require it to enter into a license agreement for use of Waymos intellectual property. 
The lawsuit claims that Levandowski did not work on software at Google or Uber, and thus those trade secrets did not come from Mr. Levandowski, but rather a different former Google employee. It goes on to claim that Waymo and Uber settled issues relating to theft of trade secrets by individuals who are not Levandowski. It does not identify any such person. 
No new comment on this most recent desperate filing, an Uber spokesperson said in an email. 
Crime and punishment
In August 2019, the U.S. District Attorney charged Levandowski alone with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets while working at Google. The charges disrupted Levandowski’s most recent project and prompted him to step down as CEO from a startup he co-founded called Pronto.ai that is developing an advanced driver assistance system product for trucks.
Levandowski and the U.S. District Attorneyreached a plea deal in March 2020 that allowed him to avoid a protracted legal fight and a potentially lengthy prison sentence. Under the plea agreement, Levandowski admitted to downloading thousands of files related to Project Chauffeur. Specifically, he pleaded guilty to count 33 of the indictment, which is related to taking what was known as the Chauffeur Weekly Update, a spreadsheet that contained a variety of details including quarterly goals and weekly metrics, the teams objectives and key results as well as summaries of 15 technical challenges faced by the program and notes related to previous challenges that had been overcome, according to the filing.
Levandowski said in the plea agreement that he downloaded the Chauffeur Weekly Update to his personal laptop on or about January 17, 2016, and accessed the document after his resignation from Google, which occurred about 10 days later.
In a victim impact statement, Waymo wrote that Levandowskis misconduct was enormously disruptive and harmful to Waymo, constituted a betrayal, and requested that his sentence include a substantial period of incarceration. 
With no end to the COVID, it is possible that Levandowskis latest lawsuit will be resolved before he even reports to jail. He may have been sentenced as a bankrupt, but he could enter prison a billionaire."

The American ride-hailing company’s results helped illustrate just how much the economy has changed in the wake of COVID-19 and its resulting disruptions to life, travel and work.
Uber’s own results, which were shared last week, provided hints of what was coming for Lyft. The upshot: a sharply reduced ride-hailing business.
In the second quarter, Lyft reported revenue of $339.3 million and earnings per share of negative $1.41. Analysts had anticipated the company reporting revenues of $336.77 million, and a per-share loss of $0.99, according to Yahoo Finance averages.
In after-hours trading, the company’s shares are up more than 4%.
Compared to its year-ago results, Lyft’s quarter was a mess. Revenue fell from $867.3 million, or 61%, in the quarter, and its adjusted net loss in Q2 came to $265.8 million, worse than its year-ago adjusted net loss of $197.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA slipped from a $204.1 million loss in Q2 2019 to a deficit of $280.3 million in the company’s most recent quarter.
Notably, Lyft did improve its GAAP net loss compared to the year-ago period, though the company has stressed other profitability metrics in recent quarters.
Why are Lyft shares higher in after-hours trading? Because investors knew that Lyft’s quarter was a write-off. What they were looking for instead was a return-to-form, and a note on how much cash the company had on hand at the end of the period. Up top, Lyft answered both questions, saying that it wrapped Q2 with “with $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments,” and that “monthly rideshare rides in July were up 78% compared to April.”
That’s enough for the company to get a jolt from the public markets, despite Lyft’s operating cash flow for the first two quarters of 2020 coming to a stunning -$958.6 million.
This is a developing story, more in a moment."

Uber’s delivery business better known as Uber Eats is now bigger than its original and core ride-hailing division, based on adjusted net revenue. Now, adjusted net revenue tells only a piece of this evolving Uber story. Income, or losses in the case of Uber’s delivery business, are also important.
Still, looking at the change of the past year, and specifically in the past two quarters, it’s clear that Uber’s strategy has shifted. And all eyes are on delivery.
Before digging deeper, let’s run a quick recap.
Uber’s reported net loss was $1.78 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down from a year-ago net loss of $5.24 billion. The company went public last year, resulting in various one-time, non-cash costs. The company’s net loss worked out to a loss of $1.02 per share. That was enough to beat analysts’ expectations of a $0.86 per-share deficit.
Uber missed on profitability in the quarter, but did surpass expectations on top line, posting more revenue than the $2.18 billion figure investors expected.
The shift to delivery
There are three key ways to weigh the company’s various businesses, of which only two are of material scale to the Uber’s operating results, namely Mobility (ride-hailing), and Delivery (Uber Eats) . Here’s how the pair stacked up in Q2 2020:
<ul><li>Delivery gross bookings: $6.96 billion</li><li>Mobility gross bookings: $3.05 billion</li></ul>Here’s how those gross bookings results turned into adjusted net revenue:
<ul><li>Delivery adjusted net revenue: $885 million</li><li>Mobility adjusted net revenue: $793 million</li></ul>And how those revenue results turned into adjusted profit, and adjusted losses:
<ul><li>Delivery adjusted EBITDA: -$232 million</li><li>Mobility adjusted EBITDA: $50 million</li></ul>As you can see, Uber’s food delivery business is doing far more gross dollars in transaction volume. However, as Uber has a better take-rate (the portion of gross spend it gets to keep as revenue) with ride-hailing than Uber Eats, the two had far closer adjusted net revenue numbers. Here, again, Delivery beat Mobility.
When it came down to adjusted profit, Uber’s traditionally-core business of ride-hailing generated the superior result, generating positive adjusted EBITDA, while delivery lost money using the same profit calculation method.
In Q1 2020, Mobility generated more gross bookings, adjusted net revenue, and adjusted EBITDA than Delivery. In Q2, due to COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts, two of the three numbers flipped. How fast the figures could change in the future if the market for ride-hailing recovers further, is not clear. Today’s earnings call made it clear that Uber is more about bringing you food than taking you to the airport, and that’s a big change for the American company.
To be clear, ride-hailing isn’t going anywhere. It’s the dual focus of delivery and ride-hailing that Uber is counting on to get it through this rough patch of COVID-19 pandemic as well as fortify its revenue earning potential in more stable times.
“It’s become clear that we have a hugely valuable hedge across our two core businesses that is a critical advantage in any recovery scenario,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Thursday. “When travel restrictions lift we know the mobility trips rebound. If restrictions continue or need to be re-imposed our delivery business will compensate.”

The CSAIL-designed robotic system, which was created in partnership with Ava Robotics, can not only disinfect surfaces that might have come in contact with the novel coronavirus, but also wipe out its aerosolized forms that might be present in the air, the lab says.
CSAIL’s robotic cleaning system goes well beyond your run-of-the-mill Roomba: It employs UV light for a fully automated clean that can be done free of any human oversight, which is key because UV light when used in the strength required for surface and airborne disinfection can be harmful to any people present.
The team behind the design took one of Ava’s telepresence robot, removed the top which normally houses the screen to display a remote operator, and instead replaced it with a UVC light array. Via cameras and sensors, the robot can map an indoor space, and then navigate designed waypoints within that mapped area and disinfect as it goes, keeping track fo the areas it has to disinfect. In operation, after its autonomous mapping exercise, human remote operators showed it the path that people would normally traverse in the space to define priority disinfection zones.
The system is flexible so that it can handle re-mapped routes, which is required because what areas of the GBFB warehouse need to be traversed can change daily as food comes in and food goes out, with stock stored on different shelves. Eventually, the team wants to develop more automated ways for the modified telepresence robots to user their suite of sensors to figure out what areas are priority for disinfection based on foot traffic and changing real-world conditions, but for now, it can easily be manually adjusted to accommodate shifts.
This project focused specifically on use at the GBFB, a priority resource especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but MIT CSAIL’s researchers envision similar systems being put to use to cover a range of complex spaces that require frequent disinfection, including grocery stores, dorms, schools and airplanes."

The drugs can have dangerous side-effects, and the study written about in the AMA journal was ended early because the “primary outcome” was the death of study participants, with 22 deaths resulting. Before it was abruptly ended, the researchers found a lethality rate of 39 percent in the group of its subjects who took high dosages, and 15 percent in the low dosage group, with an overall lethality rate of 27 percent.
“Our study raises enough red flags to stop the use of a high-dosage regimen, because the risks of toxic effects overcame the benefits,” the researchers said in their findings.
The FDA’s alert on April 24 does’ make specific mention of this study, but the 81-person phase II clinical trial represents one of the largest to date. The FDA notice does advise that reports they have received of deaths in COVID-19 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in tandem with other drugs including an antibiotic known as azithromycin (which all patients in the investigation published in the AMA journal were taking) can result in “abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death.”
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine gained widespread attention because Donald Trump advocated them as likely effective treatments for COVID-19, despite a lack of significant scientific evidence or any clinical suites done about their safety, likely due to early, small-scale investigations that showed they might have some potential. He repeatedly touted the drugs as proven safe, since they have been cleared for use previously in treating other medical conditions, but didn’t appear to grasp that this does not mean they aren’t dangerous or perhaps deadly when taken in the context of other conditions, or for individuals with other risk characteristics."

While the headlines have focused on the measures it’s taking to stockpile cash to offset its losses, behind the scenes, the nearly 12-year-old company has been busily redesigning its products. These include rethinking its home screen and app landing pages to reflect a world where short-term stays are out and longer-term stays — including for medical professionals needing to quarantine themselves from their families — are in.
We talked with Airbnb’s chief design officer, Alex Schleifer,  this morning to learn more about what’s been changing behind the scenes and how. Our chat has been edited lightly for length and clarity.
TC: Airbnb’s home page is suddenly very focused on three things — online experiences, monthly stays, and what you’re calling “frontline,” which is an area for hosts to offer housing to healthcare staff and first responders. What was that design process like and how long did it take?
AS: Our team mapped it out in under three weeks. There were a couple hundred employees working on the project at any point in time — people from ops, products, localization, design, policy, engineering. It’s a complex operation (here); everything we need to do needs to be done in 60 languages. Because of the scale of everything we do, the idea is often the easiest piece.
The difficulty was [sharpened] because the crisis was also impacting us. Everyone was working from home. There were questions around how do we do childcare, for example. But there was still immense energy, including because we had thousands of hosts contacting us and saying, ‘We want to help.’
TC: Where exactly do you start on a redesign like this one?
AS: You define the scope of it. You could put a banner on your home page, or you can start talking with hosts and governments to understand what kind of help they need and whether this is something they want, then you start building. Part of that is looking at the behavior of the guests on our platform in real time, which changes every day. It’s also a matter of talking with other travel partners and seeing what they are doing.
Ultimately, we [decided to take] over a pretty large amount of real estate so frontline workers know where to go. They also use our core search, but we want to make sure they have specific space for people who want to donate space or support the program. We had a goal of 100,000 homes that would be provided, but we beat that goal faster than we thought we would.
TC: Are these spaces being offered at no cost?
AS: They are donated or offered at reduced pricing.
TC: Another new section now centers around ‘online experiences.’ These are hosts who are offering their own classes on cooking and other things?
AS: Yes, like “Sangria mixing with Pedro,” which is a cocktail mixing show with a lot of entertainment. Airbnb is all about connection — it’s built on hosting. But if not everybody is able to travel, the question becomes: what are our options here? We discussed a lot of ideas, but the way we were working and connecting as a team [remotely] and living online with family made this idea more concrete for us. So we contacted hosts, did trial runs with these hosts with mic set-ups [and everything else required], and launched with 50 people. Now, we have nearly 100 hosts offering experiences online and thousands more who’ve offered to host experiences. Some of the most popular offerings — which aren’t one-to-many experience where you are watching a show but rather an interactive experience — are already sold out.
(Above, Airbnb’s homepage before the updates.)
TC: Do you see this becoming a sizable piece of Airbnb’s business going forward?
AS: It’s only a few weeks old, but even for a product in its first version, we were really enjoying this. It has beaten expectations, and I do think it will be a huge business for us as we get out of the pandemic because it allows hosts to host both online and real-world experiences.
TC: I’m sure a lot of ideas have been batted around. How are you choosing what to circle around?
AS: We’re lucky to sit on a lot of data, but you can only test so much. You need really strong and fast decision-making, so leadership and the executive team would meet daily.
The other thing that as a designer I appreciate is we made sure to remove abstract layers of communication. We wouldn’t just load up a Google doc but we made it real using [the collaborative interface design tool] Figma to look at all the designs and quickly prototype and screen-share, whether with the experiences team or me or [CEO] Brian [Chesky], to see what customers would see and make decisions.
TC: You mention Figma. What other tools have you been relying on more heavily as you work from home?
AS: We like to use as few tools as possible, but Figma is a game changer because people can see decisions being made live. Google Docs is really powerful for us. Slack also allows us to work asynchronously, which is important. And Zoom has been critical to everyone.
TC: Things are changing by the day. Parts of the world are opening while others remain shut. How is this impacting your work?
AS: We built the product and site to be really modular and also targetable by region because you’re right, the world will open up on different schedules with different restrictions and permutations and we want to make sure we can offer to people what is available to them. In some cases, they might be [hampered by] travel within a certain distance, or air travel might not be open, so we want to help people to find things that are close by.
We’re also building other pieces continuously, some in direct response to the crisis, including a hub that communicates to our guests and hosts what’s happening with travel and what happens after the storm.
As a global company, we’re pretty used to [adapting to change]. Of course, this is a different scale."

Throughout the hour-long chat, we touched on numerous subjects, including how diverse founders can take advantage during this downturn and how remote work may lead to growth outside Silicon Valley. The pair have a unique vantage point, with Steve Case, co-founder and former CEO of AOL turned VC, and Clara Sieg, a Stanford-educated VC heading up Revolution’s Silicon Valley office.
Together, Case and Sieg laid out how the current crisis is different from the dot-com bust of the late nineties. Because of the differences, their outlook is bullish on the tech sector’s ability to pull through.
And for everyone who couldn’t join us live, the full video replay is embedded below. (You can get access here if you need it.)
Case said that during the run-up to the dot-com bust, it was a different environment.
“When we got started at AOL, which was back in 1985, the Internet didn’t exist yet,” Case said. “I think 3% of people were online or online an hour a week. And it took us a decade to get going. By the year 2000, which is sort of the peak of AOL’s success, we had about half of all the U.S. internet traffic, and the market value soared. That’s when suddenly, when any company with a dot-com name was getting funded. Many were going public without even having much in the way of revenues. That’s not we’re dealing with now.”"

Now, the team, which is working gout of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) is taking their system even further, with the ability to identify a specific individual as one they’ve monitored previously, keeping their records tied to them over time, all while preserving privacy by not connecting this to any personal information about the subject.
The new tech, which is called “RF-ReID” is useful because it could allow for monitoring individuals cohabiting in a group over time, like seniors in a retirement or long-term care facility, for instance. This development is particularly important because the ability to monitor an individual over time is crucial for actually being able to observe and detect any deviation from a healthy baseline.
While healthcare facilities obviously employ a number of different measures to monitor resident and patient vital signs over time already, these can run into potentially serious limitations. Cameras aren’t very privacy-respecting, and they also have limitations in terms of identifying individuals consistently over time depending on even superficial changes to their appearance like wearing different clothes. Remote monitoring devices are only as good as the memories and consistency of the individuals employing them, whereas the MIT CSAIL system works independent of any on-person device.
The team that developed RF-ReID say that It can re-identify a new individual introduced to the system after under 10 seconds of physical activity, using signals including body size, walking speed, and gait style, all of which it infers from data collected by wireless radio signals present in the environment.
Because it doesn’t need any existing biographical or personally identifiable private information to work, this could prove the basis of privacy-preserving monitoring systems that could be used even in the identification of potential COVID-19 cases in care homes. The researchers suggest that the system could flag any potential onset of symptoms, prompting care workers to do an in-person round of screening and/or testing."

Revenues came in at $683 million with a loss per share (GAAP) of $0.01, with both figures down on the same quarter a year ago, compared to analysts’ expectations, and on Twitter’s own guidance. Meanwhile mDAUs — Twitter’s own audience metric denoting monetizeable daily active users — reached a high of 186 million for the quarter.
Analyst consensus was for $700 million in sales, while Twitter expected a 27% higher figure. Adjusted EPS meanwhile was negative $0.16 (non-adjusted was negative $1.56) while analysts expected negative $0.01. For some context, in the same quarter a year ago Twitter reported revenues of $841 million on adjusted EPS of $0.20.
A further note on Twitter’s diluted EPS of negative $1.56: it stemmed from a net loss of $1.2 billion, and Twitter explained that this was in part due to a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $1.1 billion and a non-cash income tax expense based primarily on cumulative taxable losses “driven primarily by COVID-19.”
The numbers underscore just how much advertising — which accounts for the majority of Twitter’s revenues — has taken a hit for the company despite the continuing surge of traffic and popularity for the site itself. That mDAU figure not only bettered Twitter’s figures last year of 139 million, but beat analysts’ average expectation of 173 million.
Advertising specifically accounted for $562 million of its revenues, down 23% on a year ago. Twitter noted that the pandemic and “civil unrest” that led to many advertisers pausing campaigns both contributed to the decline. The US, Twitter’s biggest market, saw a decline of 25% in ad spend.
It goes to show the disconnect not only between audience and advertising that still seems to exist — ads ultimately not only follow eyeballs, but the economy, and that has been in decline — but also the disconnect between financials and how a company is discussed in popular discourse.
That is to say, the big story with Twitter in the last three months has been the ongoing questions of quality, health and security on the platform, and how and whether should Twitter disable bad actors while still upholding free speech. That debate will continue for a long time to come, not just on Twitter but in the halls of government in the months ahead.
Its that focus on improving the product that CEO Jack Dorsey focused on in his statement on this past quarter’s performance.
Our product work is paying off, with tremendous growth in audience and engagement,” he said. “We grew mDAU to 186 million, a 34% year over year increase in Q2, the highest quarterly year-over-year growth rate weve delivered since we began reporting mDAU growth.
“I also want to address the security issue Twitter suffered last week. We moved quickly to address what happened, and have taken additional steps to improve resiliency against targeted social engineering attempts, implemented numerous safeguards to improve the security of our internal systems, and are working with law enforcement. We understand our responsibilities and are committed to earning the trust of all of our stakeholders with our every action, including how we address this security issue. We will continue to be transparent in sharing our learnings and remediations.
Ned Segal, the CFO, noted that the ad server rebuild should also help the company recover going forward.
Despite the pandemic, brands have found innovative ways to join the conversation on Twitter to connect with their customers,” he said. “We have completed our ad server rebuild and are making progress accelerating our performance ads roadmap. With a larger audience and progress in ads, we are even better positioned to deliver for advertisers when the live events and product launches that bring many people and advertisers to Twitter return to our lives.
More to come."

Local officials have confirmed that Tesla stopped making electric cars in California on Monday, March 23rd, in compliance with a shelter-in-place order brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic. But dozens of workers had to report to the companys automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factorys employees. 
This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insiderand Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.
The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these end of line workers that theyd have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week. 
The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order
A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it conducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance with the shelter-in-place order. Their vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures, they said.
Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldnt receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the companys guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.
The current factory worker said Teslas end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with moderate issues. But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be work in progress, which, therefore, required more end of line work. 
Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19. 
Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible. 
Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US
At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open. 
The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to basic operations like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.
Its currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Teslas environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees had been working from home for nearly two weeks before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their direct coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms. Both employees are quarantined at home and recovering well, Shelby wrote. 
Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory as soon as humanly possible as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.

Amy is also a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and recently came out with a book called The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity. The Future Today Institute recently published the 2020 Tech Trends Report, which is a quantitative look at the big trends that will dominate the future. Nilay and Amy discuss the different paths the report takes on predicting that, with the state of technology use today, there’s no future in which we are not being scored. Amy and Nilay also discuss whether we could have predicted the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, as well as how possible it is to predict a solution and a timeline for that solution right now. Below is an excerpt of the conversation edited for clarity. Nilay Patel: We’re in the middle of a pandemic. It’s here, it’s happening. It feels like no one knows what’s going to happen next, or is this something that you’re able to model or understand? Amy Webb : So I don’t want to get too nerdy here, but if you have a discrete set of data — like Johns Hopkins [University] has discrete datasets now going back to December because we’ve seen corona outbreaks in a couple of areas around the world that have lasted a little longer than what we’re seeing in the US. So given what we know to be true, and the data that they have access to, and all of the other variables over which they would have some kind of control — like whether or not we take aggressive measures in the United States today, whether or not we somehow have a whole bunch of tests, things like that. If you look at historic data trends and then all the stuff that over which we have control, you could predict a handful of plausible outcomes that tell us a little bit more about how many people could get sick at what rate and what the mortality could look like. But most of the time, we’re talking about areas of life over which we don’t have complete control. There’s no way to have total control because there’s too many variables at play. And at that point, the math doesn’t work. You can have the most powerful computers in the world, but the computations don’t work out. You would need a continual stream of data that’s really comprehensive and evolutionary algorithms in order to make sense of it all. So we’re feeling huge amounts of anxiety about coronavirus, about the oil prices tanking. I liken this to that sense of out of controlness, if you’ve ever driven on a slippery road. If you’re driving and you hit an icy patch, most people, their instinct is to slam on the brakes. And why do we slam on the brakes? Because the act of slamming on the brakes makes us feel like we have control again. And the reason we feel like we have control is because we think we know what the future is going to be. If we slam on the brakes, the car will stop, we will be fine. That would work if you were in charge of every single variable at that moment in time, but you’re not. So slamming on the brakes and really, really, really hoping things don’t change from where they are right now or that they’re going to be like they used to be is a really great way to set yourself up not only for a crash — because that’s how you really lose control of a car — but it’s also a good way to set yourself up for disappointment. And that kind of thing has — when we extrapolate that to society — has reverberating effects. So right now what I’m observing is sort of a feverish corporate anxiety. I’m seeing governmental anxiety, and companies, just like people, have limbic systems. What do you mean by a limbic system? So it’s the fight or flight part of our bodies that evolution bestowed upon us millennia ago so that we didn’t get eaten by tigers or whatever. And we’re hearing people talk a lot about their sort of crushing anxiety, and I get that. I’m going to be the first person to tell you if you gave me all the data in the world and all the computers in the world, at this moment in time I cannot tell you what things are going to look like in three months. And that’s fine because that tells us we still have some agency. Futurists are trained to think through plausible outcomes, not so that we can accurately predict what’s next, because that’s not our goal right now. Our goal is not predictions. It’s being prepared for what comes next. And that’s good news. The good news is if you are willing to lean into uncertainty and to accept the fact that you can’t control everything, but also you are not helpless in whatever comes next. If you’re willing to adopt — and anybody can do this, it costs no money. It’s just a different perspective. If you’re willing to think more like a futurist, which is to say confront your cherished beliefs, lean into uncertainty, and be nimble with how you think, you’re going to get through this. The challenge is that I’m seeing the sort of corporate anxiety which, once you get on a cycle of that, is hard to stop. Companies start making weird decisions or they slam on their brakes. I mean, we’ve seen a bunch of that over the past couple of weeks. This is as much an opportunity to identify risk as it is to think through where are effective measures that we could be taking to not just help out everybody else but help our bottom line. There’s a lot of opportunity here. I mentioned this to you guys earlier: I’m politically independent, but I’m a pragmatist, and my greatest fear right now is that the Trump administration are nowists. They are not futurists. They think only about what’s good for them right now. They are absolutely unwilling to think long term and they are absolutely unwilling to make short-term sacrifices. In the past, that has resulted in entertaining tweet storms, that has resulted in irritations. This time around, it’s going to result in people dying. And we have to be willing to confront the fact now that, without being alarmist, without being emotional, we just have to be willing to confront alternative futures. We have to right now be willing to accept uncertainty and to think the unthinkable. And right now, that means accepting the possibility that by the end of the summer 2 million Americans could die. And if that’s a plausible future state, then how do we work backward to create a better outcome? In New York, stuff is shut down for a couple of weeks. In some ways that’s going to help flatten the curve as people are now saying. But that’s a short-term solution that doesn’t address a longer-term issue. And the real problem here is a psychological one because we’re going to get to the end of those two weeks and I think people are going to feel as though the virus should be gone and it’s not going to be. So we have an opportunity now — individually, collectively — to start mapping out alternative futures. They don’t all have to be dystopian. There are lots of really awesome things that could also happen as a result of this. For example, we’re starting to see huge investments in synthetic biology and new ways of using AI as a way to speed scientific discovery. That’s amazing because on the end of this, we could wind up with precision medication, we could wind up with synthetic agriculture as a way to mitigate climate change. There are going to be some good things on the other end of it. And now is the time to start thinking through “where is there risk, where is there opportunity, and how can we start modeling alternative futures?”"

It’s understandable since fever is an extremely common symptom of the disease.

Before you schedule a telehealth visit with your doctor, know this: there’s nothing “normal” about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That number came from a 19th century German researcher named Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich who conducted a painstaking study of patient body temperatures and arrived at a mean of 98.6. It’s an impressive bit of clinical work, but it’s sorely in need of an update. So what does pass for “normal” these days?

Apple and Google announced a system for tracking the spread of the new coronavirus, allowing users to share data through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions and approved apps from health organizations.
The new system, which is laid out in a series of white papers, would use short-range Bluetooth communications to establish a voluntary contact-tracing network, keeping extensive data on phones that have been in close proximity with each other. Official apps from public health authorities will get access to this data, and users who download them can report if theyve been been diagnosed with COVID-19. The system will also alert people who download them to whether in close contact with an infected person.
Apple and Google will introduce a pair of iOS and Android APIs in mid-May and make sure these health authorities apps can implement them. In the months after those are complete, the companies will work on building tracing functionality into the underlying operating system, then let users decide whether to share information with a wider range of apps.
Contact tracing is one of the most promising solutions for containing COVID-19, but it also raises massive privacy concerns. Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concern about tracking users with phone data, arguing that any system would need to be limited in scope and avoid compromising user privacy.
Unlike some other tracking methods like, say, using GPS data this Bluetooth plan wouldnt track peoples physical location. It would basically pick up the signals of nearby phones at 5-minute intervals and store the connections between them in a database. If one person tests positive for the novel coronavirus, they could tell the app theyve been infected, and it could notify other people whose phones passed within close range in the preceding days.
The method still has potential weaknesses. In crowded areas, it could flag people in adjacent rooms who arent actually sharing space with the user, making people worry unnecessarily Its also a relatively new program, and Apple and Google are still talking to public health authorities and other stakeholders about how to run it.

Photo by Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images
Over the weekend, a man in North Dakota was arrested for coughing at a local Walmart. The store, like all Walmart stores, was limiting the number of people allowed in at once. The man apparently wasnt happy to hear that, and intentionally coughed on store employees, the police chief said.
He joins agrowing listofpeople arrested in the US for intentionallycoughing in public in the past few weeks, as the accelerating outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in states around the country put people on edge, alert for the slightest sign that they could be exposed to the illness. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and spreads through tiny droplets of saliva produced when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or breathes. 
Those people arent being arrested under coronavirus-specific laws, says Lindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University Washington College of Law. Men in North Dakota and New Jersey, for example, were charged with terroristic threats, or threatening to cause physical harm or violence to someone. Prosecuting them for coronavirus-specific physical harmwould be much harder.
You would have to show person who did thecoughing was infectious, and was capable of transmitting the disease, Wiley says. Since testing is so limited now, its a hard case to make: the cougher would have to know they were infected for someone to prove they intentionally spread the virus. The coronavirus is also so widespread that if someone who had been coughed upon got sick, itd be hard to prove exactly where they got it from it could have been from anywhere.
Creating or jerry-rigging laws to punish people for specifically spreading COVID-19 is technically possible, and people may feel like those who dont take the virus seriously or who give it to others should be punished. But turning someone who passes on a disease into a criminal doesnt keep a community safer, Wiley says. 
Public health experts have seen that ineffectiveness play out with other viruses. There are alreadycriminal laws in dozens of states that punish people with HIV who engage in activities that may put others at risk of contracting the virus even activities that pose an extremely low risk of spreading HIV, like oral sex. Theres no evidence that criminalizing those types of activities is effective as a disease control strategy, Wiley says. The type of person who would actually, intentionally give someone else a disease isnt dissuaded by a criminal law, she says.
What it does is have a big effect on people who would never intentionally spread disease, because its a chilling effect on getting tested, she says. Its not going to help with those tiny number of people who would do that, and it might cause problems in efforts to reach people who are well-intentioned. People may be reluctant to get tested or tell people that theyre sick with a virus if theyre afraid of getting arrested, which can hinder public health efforts. Vulnerable or low-income people, who arent able to avoid the type of contact with others that could pass on the novel coronavirus because they work a service job, for example would be more likely to be affected by these laws. That would add another layer to existing inequities that are being made worse by the disease. 
In most states, legislators would have to create a new law specific to COVID-19 if they were considering treating it the same way some do HIV. Logically, creating coronavirus laws would be more difficult than HIV laws because this disease is much harder to trace than something thats sexually transmitted. 
I could see some city council member deciding [they]want to be seen as taking tough action here, Wiley says, despite the fact that theres evidence that these types of laws do more harm than good. I would hope that lawmakers wouldnt waste their time."

Nearly everyone in the US will be affected in some way by the COVID-19 pandemic, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus by stress and anxiety, event closures, or the illness itself. Theres cause for concern: the disease can be deadly, and the outbreak in the US is likely to continue to get worse. 
Theres still a lot that scientists and doctors dont know about the new coronavirus and the illness it causes. With three months of data, though, it appears that around 80 percent of people who are infected have a mild or moderate illness, around 15 percent have severe disease (which requires hospitalization), and around 5 percent are critical (and go into respiratory or organ failure). Around 3 percent of people with confirmed cases of the infection in China died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Different groups of people, though, are more likely to fall into the severe or critical categories than others:
The elderly: People who are over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19, according to data collected by the WHO. The highest death rate is in people above the age of 80. Around 15 percent of people in that age group died from the disease in one set of Chinese patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who are older stay away from crowds and avoid nonessential travel.
Children: Children, on the other hand, dont appear to get as sick. Very few develop the disease in the first place, and if they do, only a small group develop severe or critical disease. No young children have died from the virus in China. 
Researchers are still trying to figure out why thats the case. It may be that childrens lungs are less susceptible to infection or that their immune systems are stronger. Children might carry the virus around, though, and pass it between each other and then to their parents and caregivers. Thats why kids should still wash their hands as much as adults. Its also one of the reasons why areas where the virus is spreading are closing down schools. 
People with chronic conditions: People who have underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, or diabetes are also more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19. Around 9 percent of people with diabetes who contracted the virus died, for example, as did around 8 percent of people with high blood pressure. The CDC also recommends that people in this group avoid crowds, stick close to home, and stock up on medication for their condition if theyre able to. 
Everyone else: Most people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus dont get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you dont get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk and pass the virus to them. Thats why its so important to stay home if youre not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but its the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. Its the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves. 
Not everyone can work from home, stop taking public transportation, or skip large gatherings, though. If you can do those things even though they may seem silly and even if there have not been many cases identified in your area you can help blunt the impact of the pandemic.

AT&amp;T is the latest enormous company to instruct its employees to start working from home if they havent already. The work-from-home edict does not apply to AT&amp;Ts retail employees, equipment installers, and CNNs TV talent and production staff, according to CNN. But AT&amp;Ts massive corporate workforce (including those at WarnerMedia) are being asked to work from home for the time being as long as their role allows for it. 
We are committed to helping limit the spread of the virus and risk of exposure, WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey said in an internal memo. We can help minimize stress on the resources and infrastructures around us by doing our part to reduce population density in our commutes and daily activities, in efforts to help reduce spread of the virus. AT&amp;T has over 245,000 employees, according to CNN. 
It now joins other large companies in shifting to at-home work as health officials and cities encourage social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19. In support of our colleagues who need to continue working in our offices, we need to help reduce population density and risk of exposure in those locations by minimizing the on-site staff, Stankey said. 
CNN boss Jeff Zucker said its unclear how long this guidance will remain in effect in a memo to employees, but said everyone should assume that it may be long term. We encourage you to use today to make sure you are completely prepared for remote working, Zucker said.
Theres no avoiding office work for many roles at CNN, however, just as AT&amp;Ts wireless employees will still need to keep the companys stores operating smoothly. CEO Randall Stephenson said AT&amp;T is taking precautions to help workers stay safe in the days and weeks ahead if they do need to leave home. 
I realize that many of you are directly serving and interacting with our customers and that work cant be done from home, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a message that went out to employees. What you do is vital to a highly connected society like ours. And it is even more critical in times like these. So, we will be taking additional safeguards and implementing new procedures and policies to help protect you from the virus.
AT&amp;T has suspended its arbitrary broadband caps (for customers subject to them) in response to the coronavirus pandemic and has also signed onto the FCCs Keep Americans Connected Pledge, vowing not to disconnect subscribers or hit them with late fees as everyone makes the necessary life changes to do their part in combating the virus."

Googles sister company Verily has launched a screening website for people who want to get tested for COVID-19. However, Verilys website is very limited in scope: its only available to people in the Bay Area of California and its more of a pilot program than a public health utility.
In fact, its even more limited than that: in order to qualify you must be 18 years of age or older, be able to speak English, and be a US resident. It very much looks like the program a Verily spokesperson described to us on the phone on Friday and not the expansive triage system that the Trump administration promised.
The new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: 
The initial question on Verilys site asks Are you currently experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms? If you answer yes, you are told that the program is not the right fit and to seek medical attention. Reached for comment on this issue, a Verily spokesperson said that:
This screener was developed in partnership with government health officials. The initial question is meant to ensure that anyone who is seriously ill does not come to our sites because they are not prepared to provide medical attention. We are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help us refine this COVID-9 risk screening and testing.
If you answer no, youre asked to sign in with a Google account and sign an Informed Consent authorization form. It details that your data may be shared with public health officials. 
After that, you are led through a series of screener questions about your symptoms:
The actual screener asks questions about travel and work responsibilities. And it re-asks questions specifically about each symptom. Theres a few more additional questions but it took about 3 mins to read and respond. pic.twitter.com/t0M8GzIP4l
 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 16, 2020
In a blog post on Sunday, Verily said that it was working closely with the state of California on the pilot program. It did not make any promises about expanding the program beyond the state of California:
Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase. The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsoms office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks.
Verilys site is located at Project Baseline, which to date has only been used to connect people up with potential clinical trials. That infrastructure for collecting and protecting health data was one of the reasons that Verilys screening site was put on Project Baseline. The site also claims that any information you provide wont be shared with your insurance company or connected to your Google account though a Google account is necessary to use the site. 
A screenshot from Verilys new site
The website launched after a weekend of confused and inaccurate statements from the White House about a website it claimed Google is building. Google had not expected to be mentioned in Fridays press conference, according to Wired. And so it initially had not planned to build such a site, Axios reported, but began to scramble after Trumps statements. Over the course of the weekend, Google itself did not correct the record but instead issued a series of tweets pointing to Verilys sites and to its own efforts to provide information on the coronavirus. 
Earlier on Sunday, President Trump held up a printout of those tweets from the Google Comms account and claimed that they substantiated his original statements on Friday. Googles tweets did not, but they also carefully avoided directly contradicting the president. Google itself has not announced a screening website for COVID-19. 
Google has instead said it will launch an informational website, according to this post from CEO Sundar Pichai:
This includes best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses. Well be rolling out an initial version of the website late Monday, March 16, and well continue to enhance and update it with more resources on an ongoing basis.
That more comprehensive site may yet come, as Vice President Mike Pence again promised in Sundays press conference that such a site could be made, and he made a point to say that the administration was also working with other tech companies. It is not clear what that work looks like, or if those tech companies were approached before the scramble over the weekend.
Whats clear right now is that Verilys website as it currently exists is a pilot program limited in scope and availability. Whats even clearer is that the administration has not yet provided full details to US citizens on when and how they will be able to gain access to a coronavirus test, though it is clearly rushing to find a way to do so."

Bill Gates is now the favorite target for coronavirus misinformation according to data compiled by the New York Times and Zignal Labs, a company that analyzes media sources. Conspiracy theories conflating Gates with the virus were mentioned 1.2 million times on TV and social media from February to April, 33 percent more often than the 2nd most popular conspiracy theory linking 5G with COVID-19, according to Zignal Labs, peaking at 18,000 mentions a day in April.
Hoaxes directed at the Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist, are all over YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. The New York Times found 16,000 posts on Facebook this year that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times. The 10 most popular Youtube videos spreading misinformation about Gates and the virus were viewed almost five millions times in March and April. The falsehoods being spread vary, but range from him creating COVID-19 in order to profit from a vaccine, or of Gates being a member of a plot to cull humanity or implementing a global surveillance system.
A Bill Gates speech from 2015, where he warns that the greatest threat to humanity is infectious disease, not nuclear war, has received 25 million new views in recent weeks. According to the New York Times, anti-vaxxers, right-wing pundits, and members of the conspiracy group QAnon claim the video is evidence of Gates dastardly plan to use a pandemic for his personal gain.
Gates has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump
Gates has longbeen an outspoken critic of President Trump. On Wednesday, he said Trumps decision to defund WHO was as dangerous as it sounds, although he didnt call out the president by name. Gates also criticized the administration in a recent op-ed, saying Theres no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus.
Although Gates refused to comment on his new-found notoriety, Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, told the NYT that it was distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said that conspiracy theories linking the rollout of 5G to the spread of COVID-19 are false in an interview with CNBC today.
Theres no correlation at all between 5G and coronavirus, Vestberg said. Its just fake news. He said Verizon planned to combat the conspiracy theories with our communication, and the industrys communication, and with health organizations communication.
Theres no correlation at all between 5G and coronavirus.
Vestberg was referring to communications already issued by health organizations and information combating conspiracies about wireless devices and health that can be found at www.wirelesshealthfacts.com, a Verizon spokesperson tells The Verge. That site states that radiofrequency energy from wireless devices and networks, including radiofrequencies used by 5G, has not been shown to cause health problems, according to the international scientific community, and points to resources and quotes from wireless communications bodies and health organizations supporting that assertion. 
The site also links to a WHO website that spells out how COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets and that viruses cannot travel via radio waves or mobile networks.
Despite no scientific evidence establishing a link between 5G and coronavirus, conspiracy theories connecting the two have spread across social media, leading to 5G towers in the UK being set on fire and people harassing workers laying fiber optic cables. My colleague Tom Warren has put together an explainer about why these conspiracy theories dont make sense.

All substantial market corrections or bear downturns begin with some form of catalyst. Just forest fires have their proximate cause in the carelessness or maliciousness of human behavior, or lightning strike, on dried woodlands – so too must the destruction of tenuous market values always have a point of ignition.
So it was with commercial real estate defaults in the late 1990s, with Japan entering recession at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, and with residential mortgage delinquencies in 2008. So it has been with the global concern over the novel coronavirus designated COVID-19. Something, even an event wholly unrelated to the market bubble, is always the immediate trigger of a meltdown.
And, as I wrote in this space one month ago, well before the ongoing viral crisis took hold of investors' – much less the world's – attention. The equity markets (particularly those in the US) were just waiting for someone or something to strike a match.
This is not to minimize the magnitude of the viral threat. It is real and – moreover – is the cause of material supply chain, transportation, tourism and trade disruption that will have a substantial impact on economic activity over the next several months. There is even the possibility of its impacts lasting through the point at which a corresponding anti-viral vaccine can be synthesized, manufactured and distributed in large quantities. And I am washing my hands frequently. But, as with all modern pandemics, COVID-19 will eventually be tamed. 
Daniel Alpert
But is it reasonable to believe that equities will recover their inflated value? This is a less certain proposition. (Although the market closed well off its lows on Friday.)
On the one hand, this sell-off has exceeded the magnitude – in percentage terms – of market disruptions observed during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and the Ebola crisis of 2014 (albeit with some delay from the first expressions of US-related fears over coronavirus). But is this an expression of the degree of the present biological predicament, or is it the measure of the magnitude of the bubble that preceded it?
After all, in both 2003 and 2014 equity markets were a mere 30 months and 4.8 years, respectively, from their prior pre-recession highs, and 42% below and 23% above those prior highs, respectively.
The present crisis began with the S&amp;P 500 nearly 13.5 years from, and a whopping 109% above, its last pre-recessionary high. 
When news of COVID-19 hit the tape about a month ago, equity markets were about to hit further all-time highs in a rally that was unbelievably long in the tooth – supported (or not) by some of the most off-the-charts valuation multiples since 1929, 2000 and 2008. It stands to reason that the bigger they are (market valuations), the harder they fall – right?
As I pointed out last month, however, there is another enormous difference afoot: While interest rates have been falling for nearly 40 years, we are now in uncharted territory throughout the advanced world. That bonds do not offer returns that move anyone's longer-term investment needle (other than traders who, if long, have benefited enormously), has produced an environment that can only be deemed investment desperation for those seeking to have their money produce for them.
Daniel Alpert
10-year and shorter interest rates on US Treasuries are now well into negative real (inflation-adjusted) return territory. And while inflation is likely to fall as well, given pre-existing sluggish economic conditions made significantly worse by the pandemic, the US is clearly in the process of joining the majority of advanced nations in depriving savers and investors of positive risk-free returns when lending to their governments. 
This leads to the conundrum voiced to me so often by frustrated investors: ""what else are you going to do with your money?"" Until very recently, for many, the answer appeared to be to wager it on additional valuation expansion in equities. I say valuation expansion because we clearly have not been seeing either rapid economic, nor any broad earnings, growth for over a year that could have justified prices paid for stocks.
The question then becomes, will the even lower rates that this latest crisis has delivered (to say nothing of Fed action to lower the policy rate in order to stabilize equity markets – which will do nothing more than that for the economy at large), (a) reignite and increase the level of desperation that drove money into the equity markets, or (b) be seen by investors as a clear expression of actual, and anticipated further, economic weakness and stifle traffic to the casino that equity markets have increasingly become.
It is difficult for me to expect a complete return to the status quo ante – even as the COVID-19 crisis dissipates. The equity markets were sicker than the virus that knocked them back on their heels. The market's recovery will be far slower than that of patients infected with the disease.

On April 2, after weeks of criticism that the UK was lagging behind its European counterparts like Germany on testing, Hancock said he was ""setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.""
On Friday, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten the goal by more than 22,000.
Striking an upbeat tone, Hancock said: ""I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal."" 
Ambiguous numbers: Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to the public, but not necessarily returned. 
Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers. ""Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,"" he said.
The issue of testing didn't need to become so political. 
When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.
It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out such as rolling out a contact tracing program. 
So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time and no one can deny that more testing is a positive thing it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying."

Ai Weiwei has produced a series of face masks printed with his most iconic artworks to help counter the ""humanitarian crisis"" arising from Covid-19.
The Chinese artist, who is currently in lockdown in the UK, is hoping to raise at least $1 million for international charities that are helping vulnerable and displaced people impacted by the pandemic.
Three designs are being made available at $50 each, including works titled ""Mask with Middle Finger"" and ""Sunflower Seeds,"" a reference to the installation that saw Ai fill London's Tate Modern with over 100 million porcelain seeds. 
Many of the other designs, which can only be bought in larger sets of four or 20, allude to state control and freedom of expression, issues the dissident artist has long addressed in his work. Among them are images of handcuffs, a surveillance camera and a crab, a reference to a Chinese slang term for censorship.
Produced in collaboration with Guggenheim Museum curator Alexandra Munroe -- and printed by hand at Ai's studio in Berlin -- the items are available starting Thursday for the next month via eBay. 
The cloth masks are not for medical use, nor are they even meant to be worn. Instead, the artworks are intended to raise money for vulnerable groups, including the migrants and refugees whose plight has featured heavily in Ai's art and activism in recent years. 
All proceeds will go to the Covid-19 responses organized by Human Rights Watch, Refugees International and Médecins Sans Frontières.
For Ai, the threat to vulnerable people's livelihoods ""requires each individual to act, both alone and collectively.""
""Our small individual acts become powerful when they are part of the social response,"" he said in a media statement. ""An individual wearing a mask makes a gesture; a society wearing masks combats a deadly virus. And a society that wears masks because of the choices of individuals, rather than because of the directive of authorities, can defy and withstand any force.
""No will is too small, and no act is too helpless,"" he added.
In a press release, Human Rights Watch's executive director Kenneth Roth described the project as ""a powerful example of art and activism coming together for good,"" while Refugees International president Eric Schwartz called it a ""noble initiative"" that ""sounds the alarm"" on the threat the pandemic poses to displaced people. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warned on Tuesday that urban refugees in Africa are among those struggling to meet basic needs due to the economic impact of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns.
Ai has also been outspoken about the pandemic's political implications -- especially in China, where he was frequently subjected to police harassment and detention before entering self-exile in Germany in 2015. 
He has since moved to Cambridge, UK. In an interview with CNN Style last month, he expressed concern that the country's government is using its response to the virus to strengthen what he calls its ""police state.""
""For China, everything is for political use,"" Ai said, adding: ""It doesn't matter what kind of disaster they're facing. The only thing they learn is how well they use this authoritarian power to manipulate the story.""
The artist also revealed that he is producing a documentary about the pandemic, and has been working remotely with film crews in Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged.
Ai is not the only artist to turn his hand to mask-making in recent weeks. Takashi Murakami, who is known for his work with the likes of Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, has just released a series of face coverings featuring his signature flower motif, among other designs.
In the UK, a group of four renowned artists -- David Shrigley, Yinka Shonibare, Eddie Peake and Linder Sterling -- last week unveiled a series of limited edition masks. Money raised by their designs will go to the Contemporary Art Society's Rapid Response Fund, which offers financial support to artists and museums affected by coronavirus lockdowns.

16,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Scottie Andrew, CNN",This is the coronavirus' staggering toll in the US,How do you calculate the cost of an American tragedy?

It's difficult to comprehend just how drastically the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted life in the US when its effects are so wide-reaching. Unemployment has soared to levels not seen in decades. The virus is ravaging African American and Latino communities. And daily life as we knew it is on indefinite pause. 
The following figures make those consequences clearer. Here, in dollars, percentages and -- most tragically -- lives, is the devastating toll the pandemic has taken on the US. 
The virus has killed more than 100,000 Americans
Coronavirus has now killed at least 100,000 people in the US since the first death was reported in February, according to Johns Hopkins University's case count. That's an average of nearly 900 deaths per day. 
Nearly 80% of all deaths occur in people over 65
Older adults are exceedingly vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus. And according to CDC data, that risk increases with age. 
About 59% of all coronavirus deaths occur in people 75 and older, according to the CDC, which relies on less complete data than the Johns Hopkins University count. 
21% occur in people between 65 and 74, and roughly 18% occur in people ages 45 to 64. Just 3% of deaths occur in 18- to 44-year-olds. 
The US leads the world in cases and deaths 
The US death rate is 2.6 times higher than the second leading country, the United Kingdom. The UK has reported 36,875 deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University's global case count.
Both the US and the UK have heard mixed messages from leadership. President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the virus and ceded decisions about closing and reopening to the states. 
In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new message of ""Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"" has confused leaders of the three other nations in the UK, who aren't sure whether the guidance applies to them or just Britain. 
Nearly as many Americans have died of Covid-19 as in the wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan combined
More than 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam. The US coronavirus death rate is 1.7 times higher. 
Almost 37,000 Americans died in Korea. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 3 times higher. 
4,431 Americans died in Iraq. The US coronavirus death rate is 22 times higher. 
2,445 Americans died in Afghanistan. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 40 times higher. 
And by June more Americans will have likely died of coronavirus than in all four of those conflicts combined. 
Nursing homes account for 42% of deaths in most of the US
More than 35,100 nursing home deaths have been reported in 37 states, out of 174,381 cases in 42 states, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Not all states are reporting infections and deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, so these numbers may be higher on a national scale. 
With their highly vulnerable residents, frequent visitors and relatively close quarters, nursing homes are hotbeds for infection. The first significant coronavirus outbreak in the US occurred at a facility in Washington state, where at least 35 people died and dozens more residents and staff were infected.
Black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to die from the virus
Black Americans represent 13% of the population in the 40 states plus DC that have released mortality data, but they account for 25% of deaths, according to an analysis from the American Public Media (APM) Research Lab. 
At least 20,195 black Americans have died from coronavirus as of May 19, APM reported. That's roughly equivalent to 1 in 2,000 black Americans dying. 
""If they had died of Covid-19 at the same rate as white Americans, about 12,000 black Americans, 1,300 Latino Americans and 300 Asian Americans would still be alive,"" the lab said.
By comparison, white Americans, who make up 61.7% of the states that have released race mortality data, account for 49.3% of all deaths in those states. In all, white people represent 21 in 100,00 deaths. 
The Navajo Nation has the nation's highest per-capita infection rate
Data on Covid-19's impact on indigenous people is incomplete, but the numbers that do exist are bleak. 
The Navajo Nation has a population of 173,667 spread out across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. With 4,002 cases, the Navajo territory has 2,304 cases per 100,000 people. 
That's more than densely populated New York and New Jersey, which report 1,806 and 1,668 cases per 100,000 people respectively. 
In Arizona, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 5 times higher than the rate for all other groups. In New Mexico, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 7 times higher. 
More than 41% of US deaths have occurred in New York and New Jersey
The two states have seen a combined 40,279 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's count. That's more than 41% of the 97,722 deaths reported as of Monday. 
New York has reported 29,350 deaths, and 11,339 people have died in New Jersey. 
The epicenter of the country's outbreak is New York City, the most populous city in the US with 8 million residents. It's also got the country's highest population density, with 27,000 people per square mile. That, coupled with a subway system that sees 5.5 million commuters daily, make it prime breeding ground for infection.
New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, is home to hundreds of thousands of commuters who worked in the city before the pandemic hit. Plus, it has the highest population density of any state. 
Coronavirus is 2 to 3 times more contagious than the flu
A person with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people. But without mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders, a person with novel coronavirus infects an average of 2 to 3 other people. 
Researchers say the US could have prevented 84% of its deaths
If the US had locked down two weeks earlier than it did in late March and early April, 82% of its cases and 84% of its deaths could've been avoided, according to Columbia University researchers.
And if states took social distancing measures just one week earlier, more than half the number of deaths and infections would've been prevented, the researchers said.
Without a coordinated national effort, states issued stay-at-home orders on a rolling basis over two weeks. California locked down on March 20 while Florida, after pressure from lawmakers, locked down almost two weeks later. A few states, like Arkansas, never enforced a statewide stay-at-home order. 
The US still predicts up to 240,000 deaths in the first wave
Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House's coronavirus task force told Fox's Chris Wallace on Sunday that she stands by the original model, which predicted anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. At the beginning of May, Trump said he predicted 80,000 to 90,000 deaths, which the US has already exceeded. 
A second peak may follow the first wave with an even higher death toll, the World Health Organization warned Monday.
Countries must be prepared that the virus could ""jump up at any time,"" and another peak could likely occur during flu season, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. 
The US needs to test 900,000 people every day to reopen, a study says
There were 378,908 new Covid-19 tests reported on Sunday, according to the Atlantic's Covid-19 Tracking Project. That's a significant uptick since March 24, when states conducted 68,454 tests. But it's still not enough to safely reopen, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. 
In early May the institute said the US should test at least 900,000 people every day by May 15. 
Though testing access has improved considerably since the start of the pandemic, faulty tests issued by the CDC are thought to have contributed to the slow US response to the virus. Still, the responsibility to ramp up testing falls to the states, per the Trump administration's latest testing report. 
The US economy had its worst quarter since the 2008 recession
America's first-quarter GDP, the most expansive measure of the US economy, fell at a 4.8% annualized rate, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in May. 
It was the first contraction of the US economy since the first quarter of 2014, and the worst drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
43 states reported record unemployment in May
Nevada's unemployment rate is the worst in the country at 28.2%, significantly higher than its rate of 6.9% in March. Michigan and Hawaii had the next highest unemployment rates at 22.7% and 22.3%, respectively.
Things may get even worse. US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin told Fox News' Chris Wallace that the US could get close to jobless rates not seen since the Great Depression, when unemployment peaked at 25%. 
Grocery prices have risen as much as 16%
Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April. That was the biggest increase from one month to the next since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Egg prices shot up 16.1% in April. Cookies cost 5.1% more in April, too. Chicken is 5.8% more expensive, and orange prices rose 5.6%. 
It's because of disruptions in the food supply chain. Restaurants shut down, more Americans started cooking at home and more people started buying groceries, though food producers couldn't speed up their deliveries at the same rate.

""This is the first major look at Covid-19 infections among healthy young adults that the CDC has released,"" said Daniel Payne, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collaborated with the US Navy on the investigation.
More than 1,000 of the ship's nearly 4,900-member crew tested positive for Covid-19 following the outbreak. After spending weeks at a port in Guam, the ship returned to sea last month.
The majority -- nearly 60% -- of sailors in the study who had antibodies had neutralizing ones, ""a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity,"" the researchers wrote.
Most reported mild or no symptoms, and those who took preventive measures -- such as face masks and social distancing -- were less likely to become infected.
""What we saw was that most of the infections were actually mild, in addition to those that were asymptomatic,"" Payne told reporters Tuesday.
""And this is perhaps different from studies of older Americans, or maybe even those who were hospitalized already, and certainly much different from those with underlying health conditions.""
With a number of young people reporting mild, atypical, or no symptoms from the virus, ""symptom-based surveillance might not detect all infections,"" the investigators wrote.
Most tested positive for antibodies
The report, published Tuesday, included a sample of 382 service members, with a median age of 30. According to the report, three-fourths were male. 
Nearly 60% of them tested positive for antibodies, and among them, 59% had also developed neutralizing antibodies by the time their blood samples were taken. 
Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, potentially disabling it from attacking human cells. In a handful of participants, these antibodies were detected more than 40 days after their symptoms began.
However, because the data come from a single point in time, they note that longer studies will be needed to definitively show whether and how long these antibodies might protect against the virus.
Lower infection rate in those who took protective measures
Those who took preventive measures were also less likely to become infected. 
Sailors who wore face coverings were less likely to become infected (55.8% versus 80.8%), as were those who avoided common areas (53.8% versus 67.5%) and practiced physical distancing (54.7% versus 70.0%). 
Symptoms more closely associated with Covid-19 in this sample were loss of taste or smell, muscle pain, fever and chills. 
Two were hospitalized among the 238 in the study confirmed to have been infected with the virus.
Officials are working to ""tailor our public health practices to the unique characteristics of this adversary whose secret weapon, as you know, is the ability to be transmitted by an individual before they know they're infected,"" Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, the US Navy surgeon general, told reporters Tuesday.

College freshman Shemar Powell: Searching for God on Zoom
My freshman year at Morehouse College was supposed to be a major turning point -- both academically and personally. No longer in Baltimore, I was trying to start over in a new city and at a new school. By attending a historically Black college, I thought I would finally have a chance to thrive in an environment that encouraged and respected young Black men.
So, I was upset when coronavirus forced the college to shut down. It meant that I would be returning to Baltimore to complete my second semester online. It also meant that I would have to find a new part-time job, since I could no longer work at the restaurant in Atlanta where I had been employed. My only option was at a local Amazon warehouse, where I was put on the overnight shift. 
I took it, but then began the daunting task of balancing my schoolwork during the daytime and my Amazon work at night. So, how did I find that balance?
By returning to the basics, meaning my Christian faith. Even though the pandemic had challenged my faith in God -- how could a righteous and just God allow for so much pain and suffering -- I still believed it would be critical to weathering this extraordinarily challenging time. Fortunately, my church -- Healthy Choice Ministries -- is still active on Zoom. Bishop Aubrey A. Harley hosts virtual bible study sessions on Wednesday, religious services on Saturday and corporate prayer, when the church comes together to pray for a common goal, on Sunday. 
While it's hard to put into words just why those Zoom church sessions mean so much to me, the best I can do is give you an analogy. Imagine you are a small child with an ear infection. As you struggle against the pain, you feel the world is coming to an end. But then your mother approaches you, comforts you and takes you to the doctor where you get the treatment you need to heal. Church is my healing mother -- more so than my school or job or any other mainstay in my life right now.
I continue to battle exhaustion and depression, but I am grateful to have some sort of religious grounding as our country battles yet a second pandemic: racism. As ordinary -- and perhaps extraordinary -- people protest and question systems of government that have repeatedly let down folks like me, I recognize the role that my faith is playing in keeping me from losing all sense of hope. 
As my bishop explained, ""This isn't a new struggle. We know this, and God knows this. We must put it all in his hands, while remembering that we are his children and we must act as such."" In other words, failure is not an option -- we must continue to push forward, just as our ancestors did, and with God as our moral guide. 
As America reopens, and as its people call out for racial justice, it is imperative we all do our part to create a new vision for the country -- ideally one more equal, inclusive and kind toward all of its citizens.

First-year rabbinical student Avigayil Halpern: Judaism kept me from losing focus
As a person who observes Jewish law, one of the primary contributions my religious practice makes to my life is that it tells me what I should do -- and when I should do it. In quarantine, this has meant that my days are not a formless mass of hours, but instead punctuated by thrice-daily prayer times. I know when the week begins and ends because I observe Shabbat, marking the creation of the world by abstaining from creative labor.
But far more important than structuring my time, Judaism has kept me focused on my obligations. 
I am currently studying for my first major rabbinical exam, which I will take in August. Over the past few months, I have found it hard to focus on my studies. Staring at my study partner via Zoom does not compare to analyzing texts together in person, sitting in a room alive with the sounds of other voices studying aloud.
On top of that, the needs of the world have so often felt overwhelming: I've been unable to focus because of stress and fear, forcing me to leave material over for another day when I can rein in my anxieties. But this new reality has also pushed me to expand what my practice of Torah study, or the study of Jewish sacred texts, can encompass. 
Torah study during this pandemic is not just the moments when I sit pouring over an ancient or medieval book. Rabbi Yitzhcok Hutner, a 20th-century Jewish thinker, teaches that the commandment of Torah study includes things one would never imagine fall into that category: all of the care work that enables someone to study Torah, and all of the care work that Torah, properly understood, pushes one to do for herself and others. Just as I'm devoting my time to textual study, I'm devoting my time to care work: from phone calls with friends who are struggling to cooking food for my family and myself.
My religious obligations lie not only in offering care to my loved ones, but in the profound act of care that is committing myself -- and my community -- to pursuing justice. In this moment, where it is acutely evident that racism is a public health crisis happening alongside, and exacerbated by, a pandemic, Judaism is pushing me to redistribute money to organizations supporting Black life and, in particular, Black trans people. It is pushing me to work within my community to advocate for concrete anti-racist commitments from the Jewish organizations and leaders that are important in my own life. 
But my religion has done even more for me than helping me focus on my obligations. It has been a guide for what larger priorities I should orient myself toward in all moments of my life, and it has given me a path for how I can contribute to building a world less ravaged by the injustices that make life so unstable for so many.

College sophomore Bella Hanesworth: Awakening my 'Buddha nature'
When the pandemic began, my school -- Mercy College -- quickly transitioned to virtual classes. The sudden shift in learning was anything but smooth, and I struggled to stay focused on my coursework. 
Fortunately, though, I was able to find an anchor in my Buddhist faith. As a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism and a member of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), I embraced the virtual platform that my Buddhist meetings were taking -- and in them, I found the strength to press on. 
This practice teaches that each person possesses the potential to overcome all obstacles. We refer to this potential as our ""Buddha nature"" -- a state of life filled with limitless courage, wisdom and compassion. By chanting the phrase ""Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,"" we help to awaken our Buddha nature. And so, I resolved to chant daily for the knowledge to navigate through this crisis. 
I didn't just rely on chanting. I turned to my fellow SGI members, who showed unwavering compassion and belief in my ability to weather the worst storm. They encouraged me to consistently reach out to my friends, family and other members. In doing so, I could strengthen them -- and perhaps even myself. In other words, we could help each other, offering kind words and support as needed. 
After my semester ended, I felt relief and immense appreciation. I had made it through the worst of the pandemic -- and my friends and family were healthy and safe. But then yet another Black man, George Floyd, was killed -- and the racist systems embedded in our society were exposed. 
The goal of SGI is to achieve ""kosen-rufu"" -- a state in which society functions based on respect for people's lives. As Buddhists, it's our mission to uproot the causes of systemic racism and transform our current reality. And still, I often feel small and powerless in the face of such large-scale and institutionalized problems.
My mentor, Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda, says, ""When the realists tell us to accept a world of suffering, a world of war and injustice, what they are really doing is displaying the stagnation and failure of their own imagination... It is the power of imagination, the power to imagine different realities, that frees us from the mistaken notion that what exists now is all that will ever exist."" 
When I pause to really consider the meaning of his words, I feel hopeful again. Buddhist philosophy gives me the tools to continuously challenge my biases, engage in constructive dialogue and fight for justice. And after months of a pandemic -- and time for intense introspection -- I feel more committed to that fight than ever before.

College freshman Justice Georgie: Never underestimate the power of prayer
When the pandemic struck, I was completing my second semester at Baltimore Community College -- working on getting the necessary credits to begin at Morgan State University. I had found a solid group of friends and was actively pursuing my passion of video production and digital storytelling.
But Covid-19 had other plans for me.
With my campus closing down, I moved home to my mother's one-bedroom apartment, giving up the cozy dorm room I had called my own, and began the unenjoyable task of virtual learning. The transition was not the smoothest -- and with my mother, a hairdresser, temporarily out of work -- it was a stressful beginning to a new chapter of my life.
Fortunately, I had someone who I could consistently turn to for love and guidance -- God. Raised as a Christian in an all-denomination church, I was taught that no matter where we come from, everyone can pray and praise God together. Every Sunday growing up, I went to Genesis Thru Revelations Deliverance Church. There I found the tools, and the support system, needed to control my fears and anxieties. I also found a community of fellow worshippers who encouraged me to be a better version of myself.
Now, in the midst of a pandemic and protests against racial injustice, my belief in God and my church's ingenuity have helped me channel my fears into something more productive. Though it cannot hold in-person services yet, my church hosts Sunday morning service online. My pastor frequently reminds us that prayer is one of our most powerful weapons -- and when we join in prayer with others, we form an impenetrable spiritual wall against the many threats lurking around us.
As Proverbs 3:5-6 states, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."" As the virus -- and police brutality -- continue to impact my community and my country, I will continue to turn to my source of light and life -- the Holy One, blessed be his name. Only he can truly make me believe that this, too, shall pass.

High school junior Yasmin Errazi: Islam taught me to take nothing for granted
Between going on college tours, studying for the SATs and practicing for a learner's permit, junior year of high school is already overwhelming. But throw a pandemic and a country's reckoning with its centuries of racism into the mix, and it can seem like an exercise in futility. 
Fortunately, I have been able to turn to my religion -- Islam -- to keep me calm and even optimistic about the future. This year, as Covid-19 gripped the country, I paused to celebrate Ramadan, a one-month holiday devoted to daily prayer, fasting and charity. 
Though I was juggling virtual learning and intense academic demands, fasting and praying each day from late-April to late-May gave me a surprising amount of strength and even gratitude for all that I've been given -- including a loving family and community, which came together, in a socially distanced way, to celebrate the holiday.
Every day at sunset, when my family would break fast, I was reminded of the many Americans who struggle to put food on the table -- and the many more who would experience food insecurity in light of rising unemployment. But in this struggle, I also saw an opportunity to give more zakat, or charity, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. Charity can take many forms -- not just monetary donations. During this period, I've donated my time to raising awareness around issues of poverty and social injustice. 
Though my mosque was closed at the height of the pandemic, it, too, still managed to prioritize charity. It organized a food bank to assist Muslims in the community and hired volunteers to deliver everything from fresh fruits and vegetables to baby diapers. While I wasn't able to volunteer due to looming school deadlines, I was inspired by the kindness of my community and took the spare moments I could find to immerse myself further in the teachings of Islam -- reading the Quran and praying more regularly.
One teaching that stood out to me was the Prophet Mohammed's emphasis on maintaining strong family ties. Without my family and their constant support through these challenging times, I would likely have struggled to maintain any semblance of optimism or normalcy. Learning that Islam encouraged -- if not demanded -- I invest more time in my family made me feel even more at peace during these chaotic times.
Though the pandemic appears far from over, I am grateful that I've been able to use this time to reflect on my faith, my purpose and my many blessings. And I am especially thankful I have a religion that has taught me the value of never taking anyone -- or anything -- for granted.

 (CNN)I have been with my partner Marco for almost 20 years.
We've survived the normal things every couple faces, along with the serious challenges life throws at you. But now we are being kept apart by Covid-19.
I am in New York City. Marco is in Italy.
We haven't seen each other in six months.
On July 1st, the European Union effectively banned Americans from traveling there. 
Spouses of EU citizens are an exception and allowed in, but unmarried partners aren't.
Since we are not legally married, an ocean separates me and my partner indefinitely. 
Thousands of unmarried couples all over the world have been impacted and have joined forces to gain attention with the group ""Love is not tourism"" and the hashtags #Loveisnottourism and #Loveisessential. 
Indeed, this is certainly not about tourism. I don't want to go to Italy to see the Colosseum or go to the Vatican. I want to be with my other half. I want to be with my other half; the person with whom I've shared life changing moments.
I met Marco on sabbatical in Italy after the loss of my parents. He helped me back from the grief and nurtured me through some difficult days early in our relationship.
We've gone through my breast cancer diagnosis, radiation treatment and, then just when we were about to start our life together full time in Italy, our most difficult hurdle.
I had given up my career as a journalist in New York City in 2008 to permanently join Marco in Italy, where I planned to freelance, but then everything came to a devastating stop. 
Because of my breast cancer diagnosis, I was getting annual checkups. During one of my routine follow ups, I was diagnosed with leukemia, which was later confirmed to be linked to my volunteer work at Ground Zero. I was there days after the 9/11 attack serving food to first responders as they searched for survivors.
The diagnosis was absolutely shattering.
I put plans to move full time on hold, and together Marco and I navigated the stress and uncertainty of a life-threatening illness.
We accepted that we would have to be in a long distance relationship for a good part of 2008, and I found amazing doctors in New York City for whom I'm so grateful.
My health and survival came first.
So for the past decade I have traveled back and forth between NYC and Italy, returning to see my hematologist and receive treatment from the World Trade Center Health Program.
It's not always easy. There have been too many visits to emergency rooms in Italy, and the travel is fatiguing because of the chemotherapy medication I must take.
But through it all, Marco and I have managed to make our relationship work and grow even stronger. It's not traditional, but we have committed to a life together.
I truly believe that the beauty and wonderful people of Italy have also helped keep me going. Not to mention the spaghetti and gelato. 
So in January, after another wonderful Christmas stay in Tuscany, I returned to New York as usual for my medical visits.
And then the Coronavirus stopped the world in its tracks. My April flight back to Rome was canceled. And then my July flight as well.
And there is no sign I will be allowed back in any time soon.
Yes, I am not legally married. I never signed a piece of paper, but Marco and I have definitely been together in sickness and health.
This is my story, but it's just one story. The campaign to bring more awareness to this issue has highlighted the struggles, for example, of expectant moms separated from their partners and couples working in different countries. 
A few EU countries -- at the time of writing, not including Italy -- have now agreed to allow nonmarried partners in, so there is some hope. 
So, to my dear Italy: Please let me come back to you.
I will take a Covid-19 test. I will quarantine. I know you believe in love; You practically invented it."

About 200 new cases and two new deaths were reported Thursday, Gov. David Ige said.
""There is no question that the virus is surging,"" he said. ""This is the last thing that we wanted to do...As we reopen our community people let their guard down. It's been very disappointing.""
Ige announced that a 14-day inter-island travel quarantine will be in place starting August 11 to stop further spread to other islands.
Bruce Anderson, Director of Hawaii Department of Health, said 117 Covid patients are in the hospital statewide, with 115 of them on Oahu. 
More than 53% of the ICU beds on the island are filled, he said.
Hospitals could be overwhelmed by the end of the month if the upward trend of new cases continues as 10% of people who test positive for Covid-19 end up in the hospital, Anderson said.
""We are approaching a healthcare crisis and bold measures are needed now,"" he said.
Anderson noted the new cases on Oahu were linked to community spread on all parts of the island, across all socioeconomic groups and communities. 
In response to the dramatic increase in coronavirus cases, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced Thursday that all beaches and parks will be closed on Oahu.
The source of the new virus spread has been tied to ""large, uncontrolled gatherings,"" Caldwell said during a press conference. ""We need to clamp down."" 
As a result, a new executive order will be in effect at midnight on Friday through September 5 closing all county and state parks, as well as the beaches fronting them. 
What the restrictions will mean
No activities will be allowed on the beach or in the parks but people will be allowed to walk on the beach to get to the water for surfing, fishing, paddling and diving, Caldwell said.
Parking lots with ballot drop off boxes will remain open through the weekend so people can vote but they will close after that, Caldwell said. All team sports that take place at parks are suspended.
""What's open are things we can control and where we have seen compliance,"" the mayor explained.
Fitness centers will be allowed to stay open but will be banned from providing group classes.
Caldwell said indoor attractions such as bowling alleys, arcades, and mini golf will also be closed. 
In addition, the mask requirements for restaurants will be expanded to cooks in the kitchen. There will also be stronger enforcement on bars ""posing as restaurants,"" Caldwell said. 
The Honolulu Police Department has created a new Covid Enforcement Team that will respond to complaints and perform proactive patrols, Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard said during the press conference.
She added that 160 additional officers will be working seven days a week as part of that team. Police have been trying to warn and educate people but will now be issuing citations, Ballard said.
""At this point we're probably going to do very few warnings,"" the police chief said. ""It's going to be citations or arrests."""

It provides evidence that people have stayed away from the emergency room even with acute heart attack symptoms. And some may have died as a result.
Researchers from the Providence Heart Institute system based in the US northwest looked at the records of more than 15,000 heart attack patients from between December 30 and May 16 of this year. 
They found ""important changes"" in heart attack hospitalization rates. Patients also fared worse during the early and later parts of the pandemic, they reported Friday in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology. 
And patients with the most serious type of heart attack appeared to be more than twice as likely to die at one point. 
There was a substantial decrease in hospitalizations early in the pandemic, with the case rates starting to fall on February 23. 
Patients hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic tended to be younger by about 1 to 3 years than patients before the pandemic. The authors think older patients may have had a ""greater reluctance"" to get medical help if they had symptoms. Typically, older people have gotten sicker from Covid-19.
Patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic spent less time at the hospital than before the pandemic. This may be because hospitals wanted to keep beds open in case they were needed for Covid-19 patients, the researchers said. The patients were all seen at hospitals within the Providence St. Joseph Health System in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Washington. 
Patients were also more likely to be sent home from the hospital rather than sent to a rehabilitation center. That may have been out of a concern about the risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus at those facilities.
Around March 29, the number of people hospitalized for a heart attack did increase, but it was at a slower rate than before the pandemic. It took five full weeks to go back to the levels hospitals were seeing pre-pandemic. The researchers think the shift may have been after doctors started encouraging patients with symptoms to follow through and get care. 
The researchers couldn't find evidence that doctors were treating patients any differently than they would when there wasn't a pandemic. Yet there was a real difference in how well some patients did. 
There was a substantial increase in deaths among patients who suffered a more serious type of heart attack called STEMI. That's when one of the arteries is blocked and blood and oxygen can't get to the heart. 
The rate of people who died from these serious heart attacks was even greater during the later part of the pandemic, the study found.
""Compared with the before COVID-19 period, however, patients with STEMI had a statistically greater risk of mortality during the later COVID-19 period,"" they wrote. One way of analyzing the deaths, called an observed to expected ratio, indicated patients were more than twice as likely to die from STEMI heart attacks during the study period.
 Time matters with a serious heart attack. A delay in care due to a patient's reluctance to seek help or because emergency medical services were behind or the emergency department was full could hurt the chances of survival. 
This study is in line with what others have found. Early research published before it was peer reviewed saw a 25% drop in the number of acute coronary syndrome cases in March of this year compared to March of 2018 and 2019. 
A letter published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine found the number of patients in the US undergoing imaging for a stroke decreased by 39% since before the pandemic. 
The researchers say more study is needed to determine exactly what contributed to the increased number of deaths.
In April, concerned about this trend, the American Heart Association put out an urgent statement asking people to call 911 if they felt heart attack symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea. For women it's more common to have symptoms like unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. 
The AHA's Don't Die of Doubt campaign was necessary, the association's president Dr. Mitchell S.V. Elkind said, because people having a heart attack have a much better chance of surviving if they get help immediately.
""If people feel that they might be having symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, then they should call 911, even during the pandemic,"" Elkind said.
Elkind, who was not a part of the Providence study, said he would like to know more about why this has been happening. 
""Common sense would tell us that many people were afraid to come into the hospital during the pandemic, but there are some other reasons as well,"" Elkind said. 
In addition to fear, he heard patients say that they didn't want to be a bother to doctors who are so busy. Elkind is a neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital and professor of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University.
Elkind said there may also have been fewer people having heart attacks.
""This is a little bit more controversial theory,"" Elkind said. But with everyone on lockdown, there were fewer cars on the road and less pollution. ""We know that air pollution is an important risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. So that could account for some of the same effect. There may have been an actual decrease in incidence of these events."""

Early in the outbreak, health experts stressed that older adults were most at risk for the virus that has infected more than 4.8 million people in the United States, but new data from the World Health Organization shows that most cases -- by far -- are reported in people ages 25 to 64. The proportion of cases in teens and young adults has gone up six-fold, and in very young children and babies the proportion has increased seven-fold, WHO said.
The increase might be explained by broader testing, greater detection of milder cases and shifting demographics of hotspots, but ""a rise in risky behavior after easing of public health and social measures"" is also to blame, WHO said.
In Georgia a 7-year-old child with no underlying conditions became the youngest person in the state to die of the virus.
""This is a disease everyone should take seriously. Please watch out for each other,"" Dr. Lawton Davis, the Health Director for Georgia's Coastal Health District, said.
A resurgence of large parties and social outings have been a source of widespread infections following the loosening of restrictions, and they are most often attended by younger people, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said Wednesday. They have recently become the hardest hit population in the county and continue to drive numbers up, she said.
In New Mexico, where one fifth of all cases are reported in people ages 20 to 29, the state's Human Services secretary, Dr. David Scrase, urged people not to plan big gatherings for Labor Day.
""Just do that cookout with the people you live with,"" Scrase said Thursday. ""Don't get the family together. There will be more time to do that.""
Masks could save 70,000 lives
More than 160,000 have died of coronavirus in the US so far and that number could nearly double by December, the director of a leading model said Thursday.
But consistently wearing masks could save nearly 70,000 of the 295,000 people projected to die of the virus by December 1, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) director Dr. Christopher Murray said on CNN's Global Town Hall.
""It's rare that you see something so simple, so inexpensive, so easy for everybody to participate in can have such an extraordinary impact in the US and also all over the world,"" Murray said.
At least 39 states as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico have implemented mask requirements of some kind. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear extended his state's mask mandate by 30 days on Thursday, saying ""It's working.""
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated mask recommendations on its website, urging people not use masks with valves or vents. While the one-way valve keeps people cooler by allowing air to escape, that also means respiratory droplets that carry the virus can escape and infect others.
Balancing rush for a vaccine and 'ethical principles'
Vaccines are being developing quickly in hopes of getting the pandemic under control, but health experts caution they will only be released to the public once they are safe.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is looking forward to getting the vaccine when it has reached a necessary standard.
""When the vaccine becomes available after a 30,000-person-or-more placebo-controlled randomized trial, and it's shown to be safe and effective, I would get it any time within the timeframe of the people who prioritize it according to ethical principles,"" Fauci told the POLITICO Pulse Check podcast.
He said he is ""satisfied"" with the first week enrollment in Moderna's Phase 3 clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine, which saw 1,290 people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a dummy shot. Moderna plans to enroll 30,000 people in its trial.
Fauci told CNN that he expects ""to get an answer"" about whether the vaccine works in November or December. 
President Donald Trump hopes to get an answer much sooner. He said Thursday he is ""optimistic"" that a vaccine could be ready by election day on November 3. 
But former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday that giving specific dates for when a vaccine could be available is ""very dangerous.""
""We can't sacrifice our standards because if we do, it not only hurts people, but it's going to damage people's faith in vaccine efforts,"" Murthy said.
Experts call for a national plan
Federal officials have often been at odds with local leaders and health experts, and five former directors of the CDC said it is time for national leadership against the pandemic.
""It's unbelievable that six months into the pandemic, it's not clear who's in charge, federally,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a roundtable hosted by ABC News Live. ""There's no plan. There's no common data that we're looking at to see what's happening with the virus and what's happening with our response.""
The CDC being sidelined early on and contradictory messages from the Trump administration has led to partisanship, confusion and increased spread of the virus, Frieden said.
Dr. Richard Besser, who was an acting CDC chief during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, said return to school has been complicated by the mixed messages. ""If you have politicians saying that CDC guidance is a barrier to getting children back into school, instead of the roadmap for doing it safely, then whole system breaks down,"" Besser said.
In the absence of national leadership, state officials have been taking measures against the virus into their own hands. 
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards extended bar closures Thursday and announced the state will stay in Phase Two of its reopening plan, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio extended the city's state of emergency, which was first signed in March, for another 30 days.

More than 2 million Americans struggle with opioid use disorder, and about 130 Americans on average die every day from an opioid overdose. Opioids account for a majority of drug overdose deaths, the leading cause of accidental death in the US. It's a crisis that's been a priority for officials at the federal, state and local levels for years.
Now, the coronavirus has disrupted all matters of life across the country -- including efforts to combat the nation's opioid problem.
Walk-in clinics and syringe exchange programs have been closed. Community support groups are meetingvirtually. 
Some who struggle with substance abuse are homeless or incarcerated and can't comply with social distancing guidelines, while those who can are left isolated and at risk. On top of all that, the pandemic is causing massive stress -- a primary driver of relapse. 
""This changing, very strange world that we're living through could serve as a trigger for people to return to drug use,"" said Daliah Heller, director of drug use initiatives at the public health organization Vital Strategies. ""And that brings a great potential for overdose with it.""
As local officials report spikes in overdose calls and deaths, experts and advocates say they're concerned the coronavirus pandemic is making an already serious problem worse.
Local officials are reporting overdose spikes
County coroners, law enforcement and emergency responders around the country are reporting spikes in overdose calls and deaths -- and they're concerned that's connected to Covid-19.
Franklin County, Ohio, reported 28 non-fatal overdoses from last Friday night to Saturday night. The previous Friday, the county had six overdose deaths, which coroner Anahi Ortiz had described as a ""surge"" in a Facebook post.
Ortiz wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that Franklin County had seen a 50% increase in fatal overdoses from January to April 15.Sixty-two people died of overdoses in the month of April alone, she wrote.
Niagara County in New York reported last month that drug overdoses spiked 35% from January 1 to April 6, compared to the same time last year.
And in Jacksonville, Florida, the fire and rescue chief said the city saw a 20% increase in overdose calls from February to March.
It's too soon to determine whether such reports are evidence of a larger trend, said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Federal and state data on fatal and non-fatal overdoses for the past few months are not yet available, while coroners and medical examiners are overwhelmed with cases of Covid-19 and may not have the resources to follow up on overdose deaths, she said.
""We do not know,"" Volkow said, of whether more people are overdosing in connection with Covid-19. ""In many cases, we will likely never know.""
But she predicts that some communities will ""absolutely"" see an uptick in overdoses.
Public health services are disrupted
There are a few reasons that experts are concerned about a potential coronavirus-related increase in opioid overdoses.
For one, harm reduction programs across the country have beenexperiencing reduced capacity given the pandemic, Heller said.
Though many states have defined such services as essential in their stay-at-home orders, some programs have had to restrict access or reduce staffing because of a lack of funding or personal protective equipment for their workers.
Federal agencies have eased some regulations that have mitigated the risks of overdoses and Covid-19 infection, Heller said.
For example, patients receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder often have to visit a provider daily for a dose of methadone. But because such visits could expose both patients and health care workers to Covid-19, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is temporarily allowing treatment programs to provide patients with two to four weeks' worth of methadone doses to take home. 
Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has also relaxed telehealth restrictions around prescriptions for buprenorphine, another medication-assisted treatment.
Still, for people who lack health insurance or high-speed internet access, there are barriers.
People are engaging risky behaviors
In some communities, services that treat addiction or prevent overdoses, such as needle exchange programs, are on hold -- leading people to engage in risky behaviors. 
Jamie Favaro is the founder of Next Distro, a harm reduction organization that provides syringes and the overdose-reversing naloxone online and through the mail. She said her organization is receiving about five times as many requests as usual because people haven't had access to sterile syringes. A significant volume of requests is coming from people in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, she said.
Recently, she said, a client in West Virginia requested syringes after sharing a single needle with three other people for a week. The exchange programs in their area were shut down, the client said, and there was nowhere else to get syringes. Other clients have reached out saying they are also reusing syringes or have had needles break off in their skin, she said.
""I'm very fearful that we're going to see an HIV spike and a Hepatitis C spike, as well as an overdose spike in areas where the needle exchange programs have shut down,"" Favaro said.
More harm reduction programs around the country are beginning to mail syringes and naloxone to people who use opioids, Favaro added. County health departments are ramping up naloxonedistribution to protect against overdoses too.
But the coronavirus pandemic presents challenges there as well.
When someone overdoses on opioids, another person generally administers naloxone to reverse those effects. Because of social distancing, Volkow said, it's possible that some individuals may not have anyone else around to administer the life-saving medication.
The drug supply is affected
Another reason people are at heightened risk of opioid overdoses has to do with how Covid-19 has affected the nation's illicit drug supply, experts say.
Illegal drugs are typically smuggled into the US from other countries, but border restrictions brought on by the pandemic could theoretically decrease drug access in some areas, Volkow said.
On the surface, Heller said, that might seem like a good thing. But a limited supply could drive dealers to increase the potency of products to meet demand, mixing powerful, synthetic opioids like fentanyl into drugs and putting those who use them at a greater risk of overdose. 
Less access to drugs could also drive users to seek out other, unfamiliar drug sources -- or risk withdrawal.
Stress could drive people to relapse
Finally, the social isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is leaving people especially vulnerable.
Some support groups for people experiencing opioid addiction or for those in recovery are now taking place over Zoom, Volkow said. But the virtual contact often just isn't the same. 
""One of the most powerful interventions is to keep people in treatment is that social network,"" she said. ""Isolation can lead you to seek out some relief, like starting to take drugs.""
It will be a while before we know the true effects that Covid-19 has had on those who struggle with opioid use disorders, Volkow said. But already, there are many reasons to worry."

""The nurses came into her room, and she said, ""I'm not sick anymore, Get the hell out,'"" Gunn said.
The nursing home staff honored Stejna's perseverance with one of her favorite treats -- an ice-cold beer.
""I think it's given everyone a smile and some hope, while it's dark days for everybody,"" Gunn said.

With schools closed since March and April -- as coronavirus cases soared to more than 4.3 million and deaths climbed to 149,256, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- a knowledge gap has persisted around how young children experience and spread the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Tuesday.
""We don't know the full impact,"" Fauci said during a discussion with Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""We don't have the total database of knowing what there is to expect.""
As states have attempted to allow businesses to reopen their doors, the nation has continued to debate how and when it would be safe to send students back to school. 
Some states have begun to put plans in place to make in-person learning safer and online learning more effective. Tennessee announced testing and contact tracing measures within schools, Oregon set restrictions for schools that can allow students back and Connecticut is investing $43.5 million in providing digital devices to help students learn remotely. 
Although Fauci said that there is no ""uni-dimensional answer"" to how schools should reopen he reiterated that the ""default position should be that we should try to the best of our ability to get the children back to school.""
Fauci encouraged teachers to wear a mask, cover their eyes with either goggles or a face shield, and maybe wear gloves to help create a safe classroom. He also said he believes a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year. 
""I feel with some cautious optimism that it is a reasonable statement to make that by December we're going to have a safe and effective vaccine.""
Vaccine prevents severe disease and stops it from spreading
Moderna's experimental vaccine is moving quickly and showing promising results as it begins Phase 3 testing.
The vaccine, which the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases helped develop, moved to begin testing on humans Monday, making it the fastest advancement of a new vaccine in the US ever.
The vaccine was tested on rhesus macaque monkeys. And though it isn't clear if the vaccine will work on humans the way it does on the primates, results from the testing show that after two days, most infected monkeys no longer had a detectable amount of the virus in their lungs, NIAID researchers said in a statement.
None of the monkeys that got the higher dose of vaccine had virus in their noses, either. That would suggest the vaccine might prevent the spread of the virus, even if people do get infected.
""This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway, the investigators note,"" the researchers said.
If the vaccine does the same for humans, it could greatly reduce the spread of the diseases, they said.
Hydroxychloroquine rumors distracting from the 'most powerful weapon' available
As the nation waits for a vaccine, rumors that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine can act as a treatment continue to perpetuate, including in President Donald Trump's administration.
But the drug has not been shown to be effective against coronavirus, and can even produce harmful side effects, former US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.
""All the time that we often end up spending dispelling these myths around hydroxychloroquine is time that we are not spending working on solving the actual problem in front of us,"" Murthy said.
And measures already in place to combat the virus' spread could be the key to solving the problem, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield said Tuesday in an interview with ABC news.
 ""We have the most powerful weapon in our hands right now, I mean it's an enormously powerful weapon. It's just a simple, flimsy mask,"" Redfield said. ""This virus can be defeated if people just wear a mask.""
Numbers on the decline after face mask requirements 
Although some states continue to see surges and set records in the numbers of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, Tuesday's total of new cases across the nation stood at 56,336, the second lowest in the past 20 days. The country's seven-day average for new cases was 65,083 Monday, the lowest figure since July 15.
Kentucky, a state that is among the at least 41 to require masks, reported 532 new cases Tuesday and a 5.08% positivity rate, which has gone down for the first time in four days, Gov. Andy Beshear said.
""Again, too early to draw conclusions, but I hope I've said, I hope that this is us starting to see, because the time period is right, where the facial covering requirement is starting to kick in and help,"" Beshear added.
Fauci reiterated advice to states still seeing surges Tuesday: wear masks, social distance, close bars where spread is high, wash hands and reopen economies in phases.
""We would hope that (states) all now rethink at what happens when you don't adhere to that,"" Fauci told ""Good Morning America.""

The reason is simple: the US is experiencing a surge in cases, with states such as Florida, Texas and California reporting thousands of new confirmed cases in recent weeks.
At the peak of the pandemic in April, 59,538 people were hospitalized nationwide on April 15, according to the Covid Tracking Project. That number reached its lowest level on June 15 with 27,772 people hospitalized. But as of July 20, that number has climbed back up to 58,330 -- just hints beneath April's high.
Adm. Brett Giroir, an official on the White House coronavirus task force, said on Monday there was ""no question we are having a surge right now.""
But while President Donald Trump, his allies and some Republican governors have pointed to increased testing as the reason, others have rightly pointed out that hospitalizations are not the result of testing, as testing does not send people to the hospital. 
Only a serious illness like Covid-19 would do that.
""As rates of testing increase, we also are seeing increases in three other key indicators that suggest we are seeing a real increase in Covid infections,"" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Alabama School of Medicine. She cited hospitalization rates, positivity rates, and deaths, which are now increasing in 26 states.
Here's how the coronavirus is affecting hospitals in areas where it is spreading.
Hospitalizations in Florida
Hospitalizations in Florida have risen by more than a third in just the 12 days since the state started releasing daily hospitalization data. Data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) show a 37% rise in hospitalizations since data became available July 10.
There are more than 9,500 people hospitalized in Florida and least 53 hospitals in 27 counties said they had no more beds in their ICUs, according to AHCA data.
Statewide, ICU bed availability stands at 15.98% -- that's ""available adult ICU beds,"" according to AHCA data. On Monday, the available ICU bed count was 18.1%.
Miami-Dade County has exceeded its ICU capacity, with 130% occupancy on Monday, according to the county's Covid-19 dashboard.
Another number to consider: More than 3 million people in Florida have been tested for Covid-19 with 350,047 testing positive. The overall positivity rate as of Monday morning was 18.7%, up from 18.2% on Sunday, according to John Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center.
For comparison, in New York City, where the pandemic first took hold in the US, officials reported a positivity rate of just 2%.
Hospitalizations in California
California was the first state to issue a stay-at-home order on March 18.
Less than a month later, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said residents had ""bent the curve,"" and the state started to phase out the early stages of its reopening plan in May.
Then cases surged. Newsom banned indoor dining, shuttered bars and forced many businesses to close once again.
Now, Los Angeles County has surpassed its record for daily hospitalizations for the fourth time in just the past week alone, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the county's public health director.
The county has at least 2,232 patients currently hospitalized with 26% of them in the ICU and 19% on ventilators, according to the county's public health department.
Statewide, hospitalization rates and those in the intensive care unit are again reaching highs with increases of 1.9% and 0.7% respectively, according to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).
Meanwhile, California's positivity rate over the past two weeks stands at 7.5%, which is slightly under the state's goal of remaining below 8%, according to CDPH data. More than 6.5 million tests have been performed to date.
""We opened up too soon,"" Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the University of California Los Angeles, told CNN. ""We didn't have the virus totally under control.""
California is fast approaching New York in total number of confirmed cases, and at this rate, could easily surpass New York to have the highest number of confirmed cases in the US.
""Whatever is done, states experiencing these increases in severe illness and with health care facilities under siege need help and a plan B, because plan A, reopening with lukewarm or no adherence to masks or social distancing clearly did not work,"" Marrazzo said.
Hospitalizations in Texas
Hospitals in Texas are facing an unprecedented wave of hospitalizations -- it is the only state in the US currently with more than 10,000 hospitalizations. 
Texas has 10,848 people currently hospitalized, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 
While that number is still comparably low to the record 18,825 hospitalized in New York during the peak of the pandemic, there are fears it could potentially be matched or surpassed at its current rate.
On Monday, President Trump acknowledged that the state, along with Florida, was dealing with a ""flare up"" in cases.
The US Navy sent 70 medical personnel from Pensacola, Florida, to support civilian hospitals in Texas as the state deals with an increase in cases. The Navy said in a statement Tuesday that it was responding to a request for help from state officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The sailors 
It's not the second wave -- it's the first
Officials and experts have long warned the public about bracing for a second wave, but the first wave has not truly ended and the spread of the virus has not even remotely been contained, some experts say. 
""Some places never experienced an end of a first wave -- certainly in the South, we never really got below a baseline level since April,"" Marrazzo said. ""A real second wave to me would be if someplace that has truly controlled spread, like New York or Connecticut, had another surge.""
Marrazzo believes that the surge in hospitalizations can be attributed to one simple thing: The uncontrolled and sustained spread of infection in the community. Until the spread of the virus is contained, the rate of hospitalizations will continue to remain high.
""None of those currently experiencing these worrisome trends ever fulfilled the criteria laid out by the task force, which included a sustained downtrend in the percent positive tests for at least 2 weeks,"" Marrazzo said.
At least 27 states in the US have paused or rolled back their reopening plans due to the rising rates of infections. The math is simple: more infections will lead to more hospitalizations.

""Notable increases"" in deaths were seen in March and early April, the team led by the Yale School of Public Health found. This was especially true in New York and New Jersey, states hard-hit by the pandemic. 
The study was first reported by the Washington Post.
Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the team found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19. ""That is close to double,"" Dan Weinberger, who studies the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Yale, told CNN.
The team could not show whether the increased deaths were due to coronavirus, Weinberger said. But there are strong indications that they were. For instance, the team also looked at data on doctor visits.
""What we see is that in many states, you see an increase in influenza-like illnesses, and then a week or two later, you see an increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza,"" Weinberger said. ""It provides some confirmation that what we are seeing is related to coronavirus."" 
Plus, in especially hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey, where coronavirus is known to have spread widely and infected many people, overall deaths were far in excess in what would normally have been expected in March. 
""In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote.
Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths. The state reporting of deaths in the pandemic closely tracked what the Yale team found. But others did not.
""For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive). 
The new coronavirus causes respiratory disease, and deaths would presumably be listed among the regular reports of deaths and illness from pneumonia and influenza. But doctors are increasingly reporting other, sometimes fatal, symptoms from Covid-19, including strokes, kidney failure and heart damage.
Patients already weakened by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may have had a death listed as being due to one of those causes, rather than coronavirus. 
Plus, it's possible that coronavirus lockdowns would have led to a lower-than-average death rate. For instance, if fewer people were driving, traffic deaths could be expected to fall, Weinberger said.
So Weinberger's team looked at both deaths from pneumonia and influenza, and deaths from all causes.
""We decided to look at all deaths from pneumonia, or all deaths overall, and see how those numbers were changing,"" Weinberger said.
The CDC tracks deaths from pneumonia and influenza by the week, and compares them to a baseline of deaths to keep tabs on the annual epidemic of seasonal flu. Separately, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC, keeps data on all reported deaths.
The Yale-led team subtracted the expected number of deaths for each week from the total number of deaths that were actually reported, and counted the extra as Covid deaths.
""Many states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to P&amp;I (pneumonia and influenza) starting in mid-March through March 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity,"" the team wrote in their report.
Weinberger's team found evidence that people were dying as states struggled to find out if the virus had even arrived in their regions. ""In some states, such as Florida and Georgia, the increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks,"" they wrote. 
The researchers said their work shows it may be more accurate to estimate Covid deaths, rather than try to count each and every positive test.
""Given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions,"" they wrote.
""It also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with COVID-19 directly or indirectly.""
Some public health experts have said Covid-19 was almost certainly spreading in the United States in January and perhaps as early as December, long before the U.S. reported the first official death. Some state and local health officials are going back to see if people who died in January and February may have in fact been infected with coronavirus. 
Officials in California said last week that a 57-year-old woman who died February 6 had been infected with Covid-19 and was actually the first recorded death in the US from the virus. Before that announcement, the first coronavirus death in the US was thought to be that of a man in Washington on Feb. 29."

First it's important to understand how the virus attacks our lungs. When people are infected, the virus travels to the mucus membranes and then the lungs. To control the infection, the body responds with inflammation in the lungs. And this inflammation prevents the lungs from being able to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide, which leads the patient to gasp for air andsuffer more serious illness. 
But there are things you can do to improve respiratory health, just by changing a few lifestyle factors, according to Dr. Robert Eitches, an allergist and immunologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Enhancing your respiratory healthdoesn't prevent you from getting infected, he said. But itdoes have benefits that may reduce the severity of the illness if you are infected, and therefore your exposure to the virus. 
Here's how you can strengthen your body's respiratory capacity so that if you do get infected with coronavirus, the chances of serious illness may be lower. 
One of the most important steps to improving your respiratory health is avoiding anything that impairs lung function, such as smoking cigarettes and vaping, Eitches said. 
Smoking and vaping cause irritation in the lung airways that leads to permanent, adverse effects on lung function by destroying lung tissue where air exchange occurs. 
""Smoke is composed of small particles; when inhaled, the particles get stuck in the lungs,"" Eitches said. ""This begins a vicious cycle of permanent lung damage."" 
Both activities can also suppress the immune system, which you need to be able to help fight infections. 
Dr. Ryan Steele, an allergist-immunologist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, cautioned against smoking marijuana, too. 
""Even though there's a lot of controversy around the benefits of the drug, anything that you are inhaling into your lungs that's a combustible product will certainly increase the stress on your lungs and the level of inflammation,"" he said. ""Even if it's for medical purposes, you want to be careful with anything that you're igniting and inhaling into your lungs at this point."" 
Two other potentially harmful behaviors are sitting by the fireplace or lit candles, Eitches said. This might be a bummer since both of those activities are relaxing. But similar to smoking or vaping, a fireplace -- especially a wood-burning fireplace -- ""emits smoke into the environment, which you would then inhale and then deposit into your chest,"" he said. 
Many candles have metal wicks, which are vaporized along with smoke and can cause similar lung damage. 
Exercise can improve respiratory capacity, or breathing ability. Alveoli are tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs arranged in clusters throughout the lungs. They're integral to the respiratory system, as they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the bloodstream. 
When a person is sedentary, Steele said, that results in a phenomenon called ""atelectasis,"" when the lung sacs don't have enough air and collapse slightly. To improve the lung sac capacity, people have to ""breathe against resistance,"" he added. 
""You can think of it like a partially deflated balloon,"" he suggested. ""And what's the way that you keep the air inside a balloon? You tie a knot in it to increase the resistance, so the air has to work harder to get out."" 
By breathing against resistance when exercising, you're ""actually helping to expand and keep open the air sacs"" in your lungs, Steele said. 
In addition to cardio, yoga and stretching, breathing exercises such as pursed lip breathing and deep yogic nasal breathing can help and are easy to do wherever you are, Eitches suggested. Pursed lip breathing is when you take in a deep breath with your mouth, close your lips, then exhale through them as if you're blowing up a balloon. There are similar benefits from deep yogic nasal breathing as you filter the air through your nose. 
Improving your lung function means ""you would be less likely to hit a critically low lung function state, which would in turn cause you to not be able to oxygenate your blood,"" Eitches said. 
""Respirators essentially breathe for you to try to push open your airways. These exercises will teach you how to fight off the respiratory side effects [of Covid-19] on your own."" 
Additionally, Steele said, exercise decreases inflammation in the body and can reduce the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious complication in some patients hospitalized with Covid-19. 
Reduce excess mucus buildup
""Mucus is naturally occurring in our bodies, and it provides a very important function to maintain good health in our respiratory tract,"" Steele said. ""It helps to capture [allergens, bacteria and viruses].""
In our respiratory tract, we have little hairs called cilia that move those threats out of our tract. We swallow the majority of mucus, Steele said, but when we have thingsthat irritate our nasal passages, we can produce too much mucus and be unable to clear it. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses, and blocks oxygen from entering and leaving the pathways of the lungs. 
We also have mucus in our lungs. People with asthma produce too much mucus, which can predispose them to blockages and inflammation in their airways, Steele said.
There may be a connection between diet and mucus buildup. ""Some people believe that inflammatory foods such as milk and wheat increase mucus production,"" Eitches said. ""Another school of thought that I have seen to work both anecdotally with my patients and with myself is eating spicy foods.""
Spicy foods that have capsaicin -- chiles, jalapenos, cayenne, hot sauce -- can thin mucus and allow it to be coughed out. 
There are a few methods for controlling excess mucus: You could try a saline nasal spray if you have allergies. People with asthma can use their inhalers to decrease inflammation, which reduces mucus. Taking a hot shower or boiling hot water to make a hot towel compress may also work, as the steam mixes with mucus to thin it out. 
""[Mucus] is something where if you have too little, it's bad because we can get infections,"" Steele said. ""If you have too much, it can block your ability to breathe and also increase infection. So you want just the right amount."" 
Minimize exposure to allergens
Spending more time indoors during the pandemic means we're increasingly exposed to indoor dust. And since it is now spring, there's pollen everywhere. 
Both can set off allergies and asthma, Eitches said, and we need a functioning nose to get clean air into our chest airways. 
""When you are allergic, you get swelling of the inner nose tissue and excess mucus production,"" he added. ""When you are unable to breathe from your nose, you switch from nasal breathing to mouth breathing. The lungs want warm, clean, humidified air from the nose -- the air it cannot get from the mouth.""
Managing dust via cleaning and an air filter, and managing pollen allergies with medication, can help avoid having to rub or blow your nose to open it up -- If your hands are unclean, you risk becoming infected with the virus. 
For dust, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter would help to remove the majority of allergens from the air, Steele said. Air conditioning registers also need to be cleaned. When pets go outside, wipe them off before they come in the house to rid them of any pollen. 
If people practice these techniques, they may have a milder course of illness if infected with coronavirus, Eitches said. 
""These suggestions have immediate benefit, but don't expect to see dramatic results overnight,"" he added. ""Your body will be subtly improved, and your body will be able to handle coronavirus and other infections.""
Taking steps to improve respiratory health is another tool to add to one's prevention kit, as we weather the pandemic and anticipate another possible wave in the fall. 
""The stronger your baseline health, the stronger your body will be to fight off infections,"" Eitches said. ""It's like having the appropriate ammunition to fight a war.""

Florida has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,"" and risks being the ""worst it has ever been,"" according to Wednesday's projections from a model put together by a team of scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
The state joins nine others -- Alabama, Arizona, California, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas -- that are seeing record-high seven-day averages of new coronavirus cases per day, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. 
Twenty-one states are seeing an upward trend in new coronavirus cases and health experts continue to stress the importance of taking precautions to mitigate the virus's spread. Despite the rising number of cases, the White House has downplayed the risks, with President Donald Trump saying in an interview with Gray TV on Wednesday that the virus is ""dying out.""
At the same time that the White House narrative is at odds with the data, health experts including Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci have been absent from many public updates. Dr. Johnathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN's Erin Burnett it's because ""they tell the truth.""
""And the truth is that the pandemic is still very, very active in the United States and that we're not getting back to normal and there are difficult things that the public has to do,"" Reiner said. 
According to data from Johns Hopkins University:
 21 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Oregon, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
 Eight states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah and Washington.
 21 states are seeing a downward trend: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.
 One state, Vermont, has seen a decrease of at least 50%.
Nationwide, more than 2 million people have been infected and 117,717 people have died of the virus.
Officials downplay record cases
On Wednesday, the virus claimed 755 lives in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
State officials are navigating the outbreak and managing the rising number of infections on their own.
Los Angeles County, which accounts for almost half of California's cases, on Wednesday reported another single-day high of new cases. But officials attributed the county's increase to a lag in test reports.
Other politicians have also attributed higher case numbers to increased testing, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said surges are outpacing testing.
'When you see 50% or 150% increase in the number of cases you are seeing -- which is what we are seeing across the South -- that's not testing. That's new cases. That's community spread,"" he said.
Texas also reported a record-high number of daily Covid-19 hospitalizations on Monday, with 2,326.
Florida recorded almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases also on Monday -- its highest number of new and confirmed cases in a single day, according to the Florida Department of Health.
But Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state will not shut down.
The governor attributed the spike in cases to increased testing as well as outbreaks in prisons, agricultural communities and long-term care facilities.
Alabama and Arizona join calls for mask mandates
Some local officials are hoping to manage the spread by mandating mask usage.
A day after the city council failed to pass an ordinance, Montgomery, Alabama, Mayor Steven Reed implemented an executive order Wednesday requiring those in the city to wear face masks and coverings, according to a post from the city's official Twitter account.
Arizona physicians have called upon Gov. Doug Ducey to implement a similar executive order statewide. While the governor announced Wednesday that he would be calling upon 300 National Guard soldiers to help with contact tracing, he said he would leave mask requirement decisions to mayors.
Some local leaders are unlikely to follow what he called ""a self-defeating executive order,"" he said.
Earlier this week, nine Texas mayors, including those in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have
 urged Gov. Greg Abbott to give them the authority to require masks be worn in public ""where physical distancing cannot be practiced.""
The mayors and physicians have reason to believe the requirements could be effective. A study reported Tuesday found that an estimated 230,000 to 450,000 cases of the virus were prevented in states that required mask use between April 8 and May 15.
Large events yield positive coronavirus tests
Loosening precautions and restrictions means more people are gathering in larger groups, which has in some cases swiftly resulted in positive coronavirus tests.
Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb announced Wednesday that he tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-quarantining for at least 14 days. He said it is ""likely"" that he came into contact with an infected person at a campaign event he held on Saturday. 
The county Public Health Department is working to track everyone he came into contact with, he said on Facebook.
Earlier this week, a group of 16 friends in Florida, said they all became infected with coronavirus after a night out at a recently reopened bar.
Still, Oklahoma, one of the states reporting a record-setting number of new cases, is scheduled later this week to host a campaign rally for Trump. 
When questioned, Trump said he was not worried about attendees getting sick.""Actually, Oklahoma has had a very low rate relatively speaking. It is a little spike, a small spike for a specific reason,"" he said. ""We'll go there, everyone is going to be safe.""
Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma acknowledged the rise in rates to CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday, but said the rally should not be postponed and ""we are pushing people to be attentive on this.""

Joined by representatives of the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the vice president detailed the continuing efforts from the White House to coordinate a response to the spread of the coronavirus.
The CDC will distribute test kits capable of testing over 1.1 million people by the end of the weekend, and another 1 million tests will be in quality assurance testing by next week, according to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.
Initially the White House had hoped to have distributed the test kits by the end of the week, but was not able to ramp up to meet that demand. Now, Pence is saying that the capacity to conduct at least 2.1 million tests will be available by next week — and that a consortium of private testing companies will add still more capacity as time goes by.
Yesterday the White House announced that it had established a consortium of the nation’s largest private testing companies, which are now mobilizing to provide test kits to commercial and private institutional testing facilities around the country. Attendees at the White House meeting yesterday included LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Abbott Laboratories and the Mayo Clinic, according to reporting from Reuters.
Earlier this week Lab Corp said it would begin offering immediate tests for COVID-19, while Quest Diagnostics said it would start testing next week. The two private test manufacturers will be able to charge for their tests, while the ones conducted by the CDC and state run facilities are free.
On Wednesday, the Trump Administration declared that the COVID-19 test would qualify as an essential health benefit — which means Medicaid and Medicare would cover testing costs. Under the Affordable Care Act (which the administration is trying to unwind) large-employer health plans must cover the cost of health benefits like preventive testing — but those tests don’t have to be free, according to CNBC reporting.
Until last week, only labs that were approved by the CDC could administer tests for the coronavirus, but the CDC opened new testing facilities for people potentially infected with the virus after an outcry from state and local governments.
While the government is touting the capacity for testing, the actual numbers are falling far short of official claims, according to a report in The Atlantic.
The report claims that only 1,895 people have been tested for the coronavirus in the U.S., and about 10% of the people tested have contracted the disease. Even with the new tests available to states and local governments, the capacity only allows for several thousand tests to be conducted — not the tens of thousands the White House has hoped for, according to the report.
Meanwhile, official reporting at the CDC is lagging behind other indicators, painting a far different official picture of the spread of the disease than the one that’s reflected by realities in the aggregation of local government reporting. According to the latest data from a disease tracker provided by Johns Hopkins University, there are 299 cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. The CDC is only reporting 164. 
The reason is that the government stopped reporting the total number of cases and has left that to the States. As the Atlantic reports:
 In South Korea, more than 66,650 people were tested within a week of its first case of community transmission, and it quickly became able to test 10,000 people a day. The United Kingdom, which has only 115 positive cases, has so far tested 18,083 people for the virus.
Normally, the job of gathering these types of data in the U.S. would be left to epidemiologists at the CDC. The agency regularly collects and publishes positive and negative test results for several pathogens, including multiple types of the seasonal flu. But earlier this week, the agency announced that it would stop publishing negative results for the coronavirus, an extraordinary step that essentially keeps Americans from knowing how many people have been tested overall.
The CDC has justified its lack of tracking by saying that it couldn’t accurately reflect the number of tests conducted as states take responsibility for their own testing.
States are reporting results quickly, and in the event of a discrepancy between CDC and state case counts, the state case counts should always be considered more up to date,” said Nancy Messonnier, who is responsible for overseeing CDC’s response and research into respiratory diseases.
Ultimately, the U.S. government seems to be [finally] ramping up its response to the spread of the virus here by providing health officials with the tools they need to accurately test for how widely the disease has spread in the population, while at the same time making it much harder to communicate the information the public would need to make educated choices on how to respond."

While Kinsa’s US Health Weather Map has no way of tracking spread of COVID-19 specifically, since it looks only at fevers tied to geographic data, it could provide easy-to-grasp early indicators of the positive effects of social distancing and isolation measures at the community level.
At the time that Kinsa’s health weather map was covered in the New York Times in February, the company had around a million thermometers in market in the U.S., but it had experienced a significant increase in order volume of as man as 10,000 units per day in the week prior to its publication. That means that the company’s analytics are based on a very large data set relative to the total U.S. population, which Kinsa founder and CEO Inder Singh told me allowed them to achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy and granularity in flu forecasting down to the community level, working in partnership with Oregon State University Assistant Professor Ben Dalziel.
“We showed that the core hypothesis for why I started the company is real and the core hypothesis was you need real-time, medically accurate, geolocated data that’s taken from people who’ve just fallen ill to detect outbreaks and predict the spread of illness,” Singh said. “What we did with our data is we punched it into Ben’s existing, first-principal models on infectious disease spread. And we were able to show that on September 15, we could predict the entire rest of cold and flu season with hyper-accuracy in terms of the peaks and the valleys all the way out to the rest of flu season, i.e., 20 weeks out on a hyperlocal basis.”
Prior to this, there have been efforts to track and predict flu transmission, but the “state-of-the-art” to date has been predictions at the national or multi-state level even trends in individual states, let alone within communities, was out of reach. And in terms of lead time, the best achievable was essentially three weeks out, rather than multiple months, as is possible with Kinsa and Dalziel’s model.
Even without the extraordinary circumstances presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic, what Singh, Dalziel and Kinsa have been able to accomplish is a major step forward in tech-enabled seasonal illness tracking and mitigation. But Kinsa also turned on a feature of their health weather map called ‘atypical illness levels’ a month ago, and that could prove an important leading indicator in shedding more light on the transmission of COVID-19 across the U.S. and the impact of key mitigation strategies like social distancing.
“We’re taking our real-time illness signal, and we’re subtracting out the expectation,” Singh says, explaining how the new view works. “So what you’re left with is atypical illness. In other words, a cluster of fevers that you would not expect from normal cold and flu time. So, presumably, that is COVID-19; I cannot definitively say it’s COVID-19, but what I can say is that it’s an unusual outbreak. It could be an anomalous flu, a strain that’s totally unexpected. It could be something else, but at least a portion of that is almost certainly going to be COVID-19.”
[gallery ids=""1964196,1964197""]
In the example above, Singh says that the spike in fevers coincides with reports of Miami residents and tourists ignoring guidance around recommended distancing. The steep drop-off, however, follows after more extreme measures including beach closures and other isolation tactics were adopted in the area. Singh says that they’re regularly seeing that areas where residents are ignoring social distancing best practices are seeing spikes, and that as soon as those are implemented, via lock-downs and other measures, within five days of those aggressive actions you begin to see downward dips in the curve.
Kinsa’s data has the advantage of being real-time, and continually updated by its users. That provides it a time advantage over other indicators, like the results of increased testing programs for COVID-19, in terms of providing some indication of the more immediate effects of social distancing and isolation strategies. One of the criticisms that has appeared relative to these tactics is that the numbers continue to grow for confirmed cases but experts expect those cases to grow as we expand the availability of testing and identify new cases of community transmission, even though social distancing is having a positive impact.
As Singh pointed out, Kinsa’s data is strictly about fever-range temperatures, not confirmed COVID-19 cases. But fever is a key and early symptom of COVID-19 in those who are symptomatic, and Kinsa’s existing work on predicting the prevalence of fevers related to cold and flu strongly indicate that what we’re looking at is in fact, at least to a significant degree, COVID-19 spread.
While some have balked at other discussions around using location data to track the spread of the outbreak, Singh says that they’re only interested in two things: geographic coordinates, and temperature. They don’t want any personal identification details that they can tie to either of those signals, so it truly an anonymous aggregation project.
“There is no possible way to reverse engineer a geographic signal to an individual it’s not possible to do it,” he told me. “This is the right equation to both protect people’s privacy and expose the data that society and communities need.”
For the purposes of tracking atypical illness, Kinsa isn’t currently able to get quite as granular as it is with its standard observed illness map, because it requires a higher degree of sophistication. But the company is eager to expand its dataset with additional thermometers in the market. The Kinsa hardware is already out of stock everywhere, as are most health-related devices, but Singh says they’re pressing ahead with suppliers on sourcing more despite increased component costs across the board. Singh is also eager to work with other smart thermometer makers, either by inputting their data into his model, or by making the Kinsa app compatible with any Bluetooth thermometer that uses the standard connection interface for wireless thermometer hardware.
Currently, Kinsa is working on evolving the atypical illness view to include things like a visual indicator of how fast illness levels are dropping, and how fast they should be dropping in order to effectively break the chain of transmission, as a way to further help inform the public on the impact of their own choices and actions. Despite the widespread agreement by health agencies, researchers and medical professionals, advice to stay home and separated from others definitely presents a challenge for everyone especially when the official numbers released daily are so dire.

The group, founded by serial entrepreneur and advisor Milton Zhou, has ample supply chain experience and recognized the need for a solution that focused on establishing distribution pathways that eschew markups in order to make supplies available at-cost.
Zhou, Australian-born founder of Chinese descent who leads Australian sustainable energy company Maoneng as CEO, has been following the coronavirus pandemic and the impact its had in terms of incurring panic buying and hoarding behaviour for much-needed medical equipment. Through existing personal connections, Zhou says that he has access to a factory in China that produces a type of test kit used broadly in that nation’s efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 (and approved by its equivalent of the FDA).
These kits can produce results in just 15 minutes, using a serological assay that looks for the presence of antibodies in a patient’s bloodstream. This differs from the PCR type of test that is currently in use in the U.S., which looks for the presence of viral DNA in patient mucus samples collected via swab. While the serological test can’t detect COVID-19 during the incubation period, it is reliable once symptoms begin to present, and could help greatly with in-situ diagnostic efforts for patients already presenting with known indicators freeing up PCR tests for broader use, including asymptomatic screening.
These kits can be provided in volumes of 70,000 per day by RapidWard’s suppliers, the company says, and will be available at the cost of production and shipping of $12 per test. Zhou said that RapidWard is also sourcing lab-free 15-minute saliva-based tests that are in use in both Korea and China, and that can be supplied at a volume of up to 20 units per day.
RapidWard’s supplies also include disposable N95 masks that meet the standards of the FDA and the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, and its partners can produce them (to FDA specs) at a volume of up to 100,000 per day. As with the tests, RapidWard’s focus is on sourcing and supplying these at-cost, without any markups or profits for the organization itself.
Right now, the company is focused on working with and supplying official health organizations and governments in need, but it does have a means for individuals to sign up to register interest, since it plans on offering equipment directly to consumers should supply ever catch up to a point where it’s meeting critical health professional demand and that becomes possible.
RapidWard is encouraging any government or medical institution in need of supplies to get in touch. Even if it can’t provision directly, Zhou says they’re interested in working with these parties to sort out supply chains in China wherever they’re able."

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters around 1AM, according to the Washington Post.
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who negotiated with Ueland, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and other officials, are expected to discuss the deal in Senate soon.
The deal still needs to be approved by the Senate and House of Representatives, but the stock market rose on Tuesday as reports came out that an agreement was imminent, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 2,100 points, or 11.4%.
The size of the stimulus package has grown over the past week, from the $850 billion that the Trump administration reportedly first asked for, to the current $2 trillion.
The deal includes an increase in unemployment insurance, $130 billion earmarked for hospitals, $1,200 checks to many Americans and a $367 billion loan program for small businesses, among other provisions.
According to New York Times reporter Alan Rappeport, the deal also includes a provision, secured by Schumer, that bars businesses controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress and heads of executive departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs.
Schumer secured a provision in the agreement that will prohibit businesses controlled by the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and heads of Executive Departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs, per senior Dem aide.

President Donald Trump suggested this week that he wants to lift emergency orders much more quickly than public health experts have suggested. Yesterday Trump told reporters he wants the nation to be “opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” despite warnings by public health experts that more time is needed to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.
According to data from John Hopkins University, there are currently more than 55,200 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., with a total of 801 deaths."

The test is based on existing technology that has been used in the Philippines for testing viral spread in chickens, but it’s been adapted by researchers for use with COVID-19 in humans, and the team is now working on ramping mass production.
This test would obviously need approval by local health regulatory bodies like the FDA before it goes into active use in any specific geography, but the researchers behind the project are “confident it will respond well,” and say they could even make it available for use “within a few weeks.” The hardware itself is battery-operated and connects to a smartphone application to display diagnostic results and works with nasal or throat swabs, without requiring that samples be round-tripped to a lab.
There are other tests already approved for use that use similar methods for on-site testing, including kits and machines from Cepheid and Mesa Biotech. These require expensive dedicated table-top micro-labs, however, which is installed in dedicated healthcare facilities including hospitals. This test from UK scientists has the advantage of running on inexpensive hardware, with testing capabilities for up to six people at once, which can be deployed in doctor’s offices, hospitals and even potentially workplaces and homes for truly widespread, accessible testing.
Some frontline, rapid results tests are already in use in the EU and China, but these are generally serological tests that rely on the presence of antibodies, whereas this group’s diagnostics are molecular, so it can detect the presence of viral DNA even before antibodies are present. This equipment could even potentially be used to detect the virus in asymptomatic individuals who are self-isolating at home, the group notes, which would go a long way to scoping out the portion of the population that’s not currently a priority for other testing methods, but that could provide valuable insight into the true extend of silent, community-based transmission of the coronavirus."

Amazon Care, the health arm formed by Amazon initially for internal employee care, will be handling the delivery of the kits, as well as transportation of collected samples to the test labs, as first reported by CNBC.
While the FDA updated its guidance just a few days ago to specifically exclude at-home testing from the Emergency Use Authorization that is in place to enable broadened private lab testing of potential COVID-19 cases, the arrangement with the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and Amazon Care bypasses use of the traditional mail or package delivery network. The Amazon Care drivers who are doing the test kit drop-offs and deliveries are specifically trained in proper handling of sensitive medical materials, and the SCAN project is for a limited research endeavor undertaken in order to help “understand how coronavirus is spreading in the Greater Seattle area.”
Availability of kits will be limited, but will include the kind of swab testing that is being conducted at drive-through testing facilities in the U.S. Should a sample test positive for COVID-19, the person who provided the sample to SCAN will be contacted by a healthcare worker for next steps, including advice on how to seek treatment and prevent transmission.
SCAN is the result of a partnership by Seattle &amp; King County’s Public Health department, as well as a team of hospitals and health organizations that created the Seattle Flu Study, a similar project meant to study the spread of the traditional seasonal flu within the community. The research and data modeling work done for that study have been adapted to the study of COVID-19, and the flu study has been put on hold while researchers focus on the pandemic instead."

The efforts include development of a high-throughput lab that can process as many as 10,000 tests per day, with a turnaround time of within 24 hours for reporting results to physicians. In order to provide the most benefit possible from the effort of standing this lab up, Color will also make the design, protocols and specifics of this lab available open-source to anyone else looking to establish high-capacity lab testing.
Color’s lab is also already nearly ready to begin processing samples — it’s going live “in the coming week,” according to Laraki. The Color team worked in tandem with MIT’s Broad Institute, as well as Harvard and Weill Cornell Medicine to develop its process and testing techniques that can allow for higher bandwidth results output versus standard, in-use methods.
The focus of Color’s efforts in making this happen have been on using automation wherever possible, and seeking techniques that source parts and components, including reagents, that can come from different supply chains. That’s actually a crucial ingredient to being able to ramp efforts at scale nationally and globally, because if everyone is using the same lab processing methods, you’re going to run up against a bottleneck pretty quickly in terms of supplies. Being able to process tens of thousands of tests per day is great on paper, but it means nothing if one ingredient you need to make that happen is also required by every other testing lab in the country.
Color has also made efforts to address COVID-19 response in two other key areas: testing for front-line and essential workers, and post-test follow-up and processing. To address the need for testing for those workers who continue to operate in public-facing roles despite the risks, Color has redirected its enterprise employee base to providing, in tandem with governments and employers, onsite clinical test administration, lab transportation and results reporting with patient physicians.
For its post-test workflow, Color is working to address the challenges reported by other clinicians and health officials around how difficult it is to be consistent and effective in following up on the results of tests, as well as next steps. So the company is opening up their own platform for doing so, which they’ve re-tooled in response to their experience to date, and making that available to any other COVID-19 testing labs for free use. These resources include test result reporting, guidelines and instructions for patients, follow-up questionnaires around contact tracing and support for how to reach out to potentially exposed individuals tied to a patient who tests positive.
To date, Color says that it has been able to operate at cost, in part backed by support by philanthropic public and private donations. The company is encouraging direct outreach via its covid-response@color.com email in case anyone thinks they can contribute to or benefit from the project and the resources being made available."

It eventually became a dating app—and its value is rising in the midst of a pandemic.",https://www.wired.com/story/rocket-scientists-love-algorithm-adds-up-during-covid-19/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f3c63c4d741517d4f090327/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/backchannel-relationship-algorithm-813494828.jpg",2020-08-21T11:00:00Z,"In 2014, Rashied Amini was just another engineer in love. He had a job at NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab in LA and a girlfriend he believed was the one. I was in a long-term relationship with someone I was very much in love with, and I was getting ready to commit, considered proposing, he says. 
Unfortunately, his girlfriend had not come to the same conclusion. The numbers did not add up the same way for her. So we had this sort of long, drawn-out breakup where she didnt know if she wanted to be with me, Amini says. She didn't know how to make that decision. She threw out a suggestion: How about a cost-benefit analysis of our relationship.
She might well have meant it as a jokemaybe even a testbut Amini couldnt stop himself. The first thing I did was that sort of nervous laughter of, You can't be serious. This is silly, he says. And then the next thing that happens is, oh, that light bulb goes off and, You know what? I bet I could build this. Thats the engineer me. He opened up Excel and started computing a crude utility value of his relationship. Thus Nanaya, a love prediction algorithm, was born. It was conjured in the hopes that love would listen to numbers.
Amini started off with the basics, working part time on what would become a full-fledged dating-app startup. His work as a rocket scientist gave him a framework. I had worked on designing moon or Mars bases and trying to understand how much is it going to cost. Theres a lot of uncertainty. So what you need to be able to address is that uncertainty, he says. 
Romance, he figured, simply presented a different set of uncertainties. You leave the home, and as soon as you leave the home there is this vast envelope of all the different types of people you can meet, he says. There's going to be a certain set of people you meet within that larger envelope of possibility. So there's going to have to be some tricks involved with trying to constrain that uncertainty to what's actually realistic to the life of any individual.
Amini engineered Nanaya to provide clients with a report on their love chances, quantifying the multiple uncertainties of love. It offers free personality and prediction tests, but the much more elaborate premium services costs a one-time charge of $9. (If youre going to do this, pay the money.) It launched in 2016 and has hundreds of thousands of users, which gives it a unique database of information about peoples love choices, though Amini hasnt left his job at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
There are many dating apps with more users, of course. But Nanaya has depth. Its questionnaire, particularly in the premium version, is truly extensive, with questions about your larger community, professional and social associations, behaviors, and preferences. Sometimes these questions seem strange or irrelevant: Do you have a pet reptile? How many subway stops do you take to get to work?
The questionnaire is the key to Nanaya, both to its effectiveness and to the insights into relationships it can provide. Because you know the communities, you can try to assess the probability of finding someone youre compatible with in those communities, Amini says. Once you have that probability, you plop it into a different equation, and you can figure out what are the odds and time of finding someone compatible given all of your social interactions for all of the communities you're a part of. The value is probabilistic, expressed as the time in which it is most likely for you to find lovea useful number to know about yourself, if somewhat frightening to face.
Knowing that numberthe utility value of your relationshipsmay never be more valuable than it is right now. The app is an aid to finding love, but it is equally an aid to evaluating a relationship you happen to be in. Your use-value in a relationship applies both at times when youre single and at times when youre with someone. Covid-19 is a relationship catalyst; it breaks couples, and it makes couples. In Wuhan, and in Lombardy, the divorce rate has been spiking the moment the disease ebbs. Some married couples, forced into intimacy without relief, have discovered that they dont particularly like one other. And single people, after a long period without touch and the solitary contemplation of mortality, are flocking to relationships, however they can."

His father-in-law had died from the virus, which is officially named COVID-19, in China. The family was flown back to California during the height of the outbreak, and they were promptly placed in isolation because of their contact with Wucinski's father-in-law. When Annabelle coughed in front of medical staff, the Center for Disease Control suggested the family stay in isolation for longer. 
""Fortunately from what I understand,"" Wucinski said, before coughing into his hand, ""It is contagious but the death rate is pretty low."" 
He coughed again before saying, ""Yeah, I understand the fear.""

He assured the Fox hosts that he had been tested twice, and the results for COVID-19 came back negative both times. He paused to drink from his daughter's water bottle, which she puts back in her mouth after he took a swig. 
""The cough, probably just nerves,"" Wucinski said. 
Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organization. It's closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and is so far responsible for 2,861 deaths worldwide. There have been 59 reported cases in the United States. 
To prevent the spread of coronavirus, the CDC recommends avoiding touching your face, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and frequent hand washing.

Johns Hopkins, building on its excellent work developing COVID-19 case tracking and basic information resources, has developed a new hub called the COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative that breaks down what kinds of tests are available, as well as where they’re being administered in the U.S., and in what volume.
The new hub offers answers to commonly asked questions like how COVID-19 is currently diagnosed, what the differences are between the two major types of tests used (molecular and serological) and what is required for testing in terms of both payment and qualifying symptoms/exposure risk.
Crucially, it also provides a state-by-state breakdown of how many tests have been performed, graphed against the total number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths in that state. They also provide a report on the weekly rate of change in positive tests across all states, showing whether there’s been an increase in the namer of positive tests or a decrease on a week-over-week basis, and in either case, by how much.
Johns Hopkins notes that the data may not be consistent, since it’s being pulled from a number of publicly available sources, and it notes further that states themselves are not consistent. The school says it’s doing what it can to account for the irregularities that result from inconsistent reporting, but doesn’t want to misrepresent the data.
The overall picture of how many tests have been completed, as well as where and by who, along with positive results, has been a topic of a lot of confusion and debate. The White House has consistently provided numbers that are out of sync with the reality in terms of numbers reported by states, particularly when it comes to test volume.
The Johns Hopkins hub provides likely the best source yet for a good snapshot of the current state of testing on a state-by-state basis, and the resource will be updated regularly with new info as it becomes available. Widespread testing is a key ingredient in any effective COVID-19 control measures, and this should act as a sort of report card to provide an indicator how how well we’re doing on this front."

Also, in the U.S., there are now more cities available to review.
Apple’s made this data available in order to help governments, transportation authorities and cities make better sense of the impact that the ongoing pandemic is having, and potentially provide information about the effective of, and compliance rate with, efforts like broad social distancing measures and shelter-in-place orders.

Environmental advocates say that's not any safer.,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-fears-shouldnt-trash-your-zero-waste-efforts/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e6bbaf3b550590008b553e9/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_zerowaste_95883063.jpg",2020-03-14T12:00:00Z,"For Béa Johnson, the author of Zero Waste Home, one of the founding texts of the zero waste movement, the hygienic uncertainty in the supply chain is one reason she prefers a reusable water canteen to disposable water bottles. With disposables, you have no idea who has touched it. With your own reusables, you do! she wrote in an email to Grist. Being afraid of reusables is as ridiculous as being afraid of Corona beer, Johnson added.
So why do we tend to think of plastic packaging as being sanitary when its not? Szaky traces that idea to the 1950s, when the oil industry first introduced disposable plastic packaging and goods. Disposability brought about unparalleled affordability and convenience. Moving from a plate you had to washprobably by hand, because there werent even dishwashers thento a disposable plate you could throw away was massively liberating and also very cheap, Szaky told Grist. And I think what ended up happening is people got this misperception that wrapping something in plastic also made it more sanitary.
Loops circular model is aimed at doing away with the stereotype that packaging has to be disposable to be sanitary. Szaky emphasized that the process of rewashing Loops reusable packaging is at the most sophisticated level washing can be. The cleaning facility looks like a silicon wafer factory, he told Grist.
But Vineet Menachery, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says that level of sophistication isnt necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Depending on temperature and humidity, coronaviruses can survive on hard surfaces like steel or plastic for two to nine daysbut only if you dont do anything to stop them. Relatively minor cleaning will actually dissolve or destroy the virus, and so if you use anything with between 60 and 70 percent ethanol, the virus will be destroyed in less than 60 seconds, Menachery told Grist.
When it comes to reusable cups, mugs, and plates, plain old soap and water does the trick. If youre regularly cleaning stuff, you should be fine, Menachery said. My house, we have three kids, so were running the dishwasher all the time. I wouldnt expect any virus to survive a dishwasher.
As for secondhand or shared clothingor cloth napkinsMenachery said people are unlikely to get Covid-19 from fabric because if the surfaces absorb, its harder to transmit the virus. But again, washing fabric with detergent and water will destroy the coronavirus.
I asked Menachery about the likelihood of contracting Covid-19 from a shared or secondhand object like a library book or a secondhand appliance from Craigslist. A Clorox wipe or something like that would definitely dissolve the virus, he said, though he added that those products might be hard to find right now. As for reusable shopping bags, Menachery said hed used one himself at the grocery store recently. Id be less worried about my shopping and more worried about maybe the touch screen when youre punching in your codes for the ATM or whatever, he said.
In other words: Buying new rather than secondhand wont protect you from Covid-19. Youre more likely to get coronavirus buying something new that got coughed on by the last person to walk down the aisle than from a secondhand item thats been washed with soap and water or wiped down with sanitizing wipes.
The bottom line, Menachery said, is that the best way to avoid getting Covid-19 from an inanimate objectwhether its new or usedis not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth after you touch it. The inanimate object could be coated, he said. And as long as you dont bring it to the mucosal surface, its hard to get infected that way.
Regardless of how long the coronavirus epidemic lasts, the problems of environmental degradation, climate change, and plastic pollution will still be with us when it ends. So Szaky says, dont take coronavirus as a sign you need to give up your vintage clothing habit or avoid shopping at a package-free store. Thats really important for the environment to do, and we shouldnt suddenly forsake that because of all the fear around this particular issue, said Szaky.

Normally gridlocked cities like Los Angeles and Chicago have seen much faster traffic speeds during so-called rush hour53 percent and 70 percent, respectivelyas residents hunker down and hope social distancing does its work.
But shelter-in-place orders are harder to carry out when your office is moving 65 mph, traveling hundreds of miles a day, and helping to move the emergency supplies that are keeping the country running during an unprecedented public health crisis. Were still moving America, says Steve Fields, a Kansas City-based truck driver with YRC Freight.
Covid-19 is causing the mother of all supply chain disruptions, Peggy Dorf, an analyst with the freight marketplace DAT Solutions, wrote this week on the companys blog. Emergency medical supplies like masks, ventilators, and soap need to be transported from manufacturers to medical centers, and the raw materials that help manufacturers build those thingspaper, plastic, alcoholneed to get to the factory. Grocery shelves must be restocked, and quickly, while customers like schools no longer need their regular shipments. Americans everywhere cry out for more toilet paper.

Data from DAT shows spot ratesthat is, the cost to hire a last-minute truck on the open markethave jumped 6.1 percent since late February, and that rates for 63 of the countrys 100 most high volume truck routes have risen. Load-to-truck ratios, industry shorthand for the demand for trucks on the road, sharply rose above 2019 levels in mid-February. This is not normal for March, Dorf wrote. At some distribution centers, where drivers unload their trucks full of household goods and groceries, truckers have taken to Facebook to complain of long lines and traffic.
Last week, in response to the crisis, the Department of Transportation suspended some regulations requiring drivers to take off-road breaks while making deliveries. Usually, drivers are only permitted to work 14 hour days, and can spend only 11 of those actually driving. But those hours of service regulations no longer apply to drivers transporting full loads of emergency supplies, like medical equipment related to Covid-19, masks and gloves, groceries, fuel, and equipment for building temporary housing or quarantine spaces. Drivers still have to take a minimum 10-hour break after theyve dropped off their emergency loads, and to stop driving if they feel drowsy at any point.

One point of contention is that essential feature of the truckers life: the truck stop. Even as public health officials close down restaurants and bars for fear of spreading the novel coronavirus, truckers are hoping states make an exception for their travel centers. In Pennsylvania, a Tuesday shutdown of public interstate and turnpike stops led to a revolt from two national lobbying groups, the American Trucking Association and the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. The groups say truckers need those places to sleep, because parking lots are often the safest places for drivers to pull over for some shuteye. On Thursday, the Pennsylvania DOT said it would reopen the parking lots and bathrooms in 13 of the 30 state-operated stops.
Still, coronavirus has changed life for drivers. TA-Petro, one of the nations largest travel center operators, has closed its driver lounges and fitness centers, and, to the disappointment of many, shut down its buffets and soup and salad bars in states where public officials have closed restaurants. Drivers can still pick up take-out food and take showers at the companys facilities. A competitor, the Pilot Company, has had to close its gaming rooms in Illinois, Louisiana, and Nevada. Some truckers use refillable mugs at truck stops. Dont do that anymore, the companies say. (Youll still qualify for the refillable mug discount.)

Dan Horvath, usually the American Trucking Associations vice president of safety policy but now the organizations Covid-19 czar, says the group is on the lookout for what he calls onerous restrictions on driversfor example, demanding to take a drivers temperature before they drop off a load at a facility, or quizzing them on where they have traveled in the last few days, or refusing to allow drivers to use bathrooms. Treat drivers like human beings, Horvath says.
A recent survey of carriers by the transportation logistics software company Transplace found that some companies were stepping up their truck cleaning, providing hand sanitizer to drivers, and asking drivers to stay in their cabs whenever they could.
Truck drivers who spoke to WIRED this week said they werent yet worried about getting sick. Im alert, says Fields, the Kansas City truck driver, who operates a different vehicle every day. I haven't really changed a lot of my daily routine. I wash my hands a lot anyway, and I wipe down every truck. I learned a long time ago that sickness goes around so easily when you're working with other people.

He calculated safe distances for each sport: That 65 feet is needed when riding a bike at 18 miles per hour, 33 feet while running at a 6:44 minutes-per-mile pace, or 16 feet while walking at a normal pace. By that time, the droplets will have moved down to the ground and you wont get them in your face, says Blocken. What about riding or jogging side by side? Its no problem unless you turn your head and cough in their direction, Blocken added.
The wind tunnel tests concluded that the zone of potential danger falls in a narrow slipstream behind runners and cyclists, instead of forming a wide V-shaped cone. In theory, Blocken says, this means that runners or cyclists can limit their exposure even more by staggering their position to avoid that slipstream.
The root of the debate over Blockens study isnt whether his team correctly gauged where the droplets might fall; its that its led to such intense speculation over how likely these particles are to make anyone sick.

Right now, we know that the coronavirus is passed from person to person when someone coughs or sneezes, or when the virus lands on a surface and is touched by a person who then touches their face. The amount of time the viruses can survive outside the body depends on the surface, according to the National Institutes of Health. Its also not clear what amount or density of viral particles it takes to infect someone, although thats a question that scientists really want to answer. They know that the density of particles, or viral load, plays a big role; crowded indoor spaces carry a bigger viral load than open outdoor spaces. Virologists also note that the time of exposure is importanta brief hello to a neighbor on the sidewalk poses less of a risk than sitting next to your friend at an outdoor café for a few beers.
But so far there are no published studies of the spread of the novel coronavirus from one person to another in outdoor settings. One recent study of 318 outbreaks of three or more Covid-19 patients found all but one transmission occurred indoorsbut as with many studies being conducted right now, that report was published as a pre-print in MedRxiv by a team of researchers at Hong Kong University and Southeast University in Nanjing, China, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed.
Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne transmission of viral diseases and a professor of civil engineering at Virginia Tech, says the issue of whether people can become infected from cyclists or runners is still undecided. We need to keep in mind, though, that we don't yet know what size particles released by an infected person actually contain virus and whether that virus is alive, or can still infect others, Marr wrote in an email to WIRED.
She agreed with Blockens advice to walkers and runners to allow for greater spacing if traveling right in front of or right behind another person. However, she notes that the study assumed no wind. Basically, if you're directly upwind or downwind of others, Marr wrote allow for more space.
Marr wrote that she wasnt upset that the researchers decided to publicize their work through the media instead of through the traditional route of submitting the study to a peer-reviewed journal. Given the situation we're in, I think it's fair that the researchers shared the results because they could be immediately useful, she wrote.

A half dozen other virologists contacted by WIRED declined to comment on Brackens study, saying they were busy reviewing papers or conducting their own research, or had responded to reporters requests last week. But as many researchers in this field had previously told WIREDs Roxanne Khamsi, theres still a vigorous debate among researchers over how likely the virus is to spread through air. Some argue that if its spread through larger blobs or droplets that are coughed, sneezed or exhaled, it will fall quickly to the ground; others argue that if it is spread through finer aerosols it can linger aloft for much longer, creating a higher infection risk. And some say theres no clear division between the two categories, anyway."

By the end of the month, part of that once-open space had been enclosed by temporary walls. Two swinging doors led to a new entrance, with a registration desk protected by a pane of glass. Beyond that, a series of cubicles waited, spaced 6 feet apart. Hand sanitizers dotted the walls. One room was reserved for testing. Health care workers were trained to travel the new hallway in one direction, to reduce crowding. A portable HVAC unit circulated air in and out.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
The new temporary facility is for assessing potential Covid-19 patients. With the renovations, the Springfield ER in just a few weeks more than tripled its triage capacity, to 33 from 10, with an eye toward the special needs of infectious diseases.
Pop-up field hospitals and Navy hospital ships have received a lot of attention during the Covid-19 crisis. US hospitals generally do not have surplus beds and protective equipment, because of the cost. So bed-filled convention centers in New York City and Detroit have become unsettling symbols of American shortcomings in preparing for the virus. But inside and around hospitals bracing for more sick patients, the changes have been subtlerif just as serious.
Health care workers need more space for examining patients, handwashing, and putting on and taking off personal protective equipment. They need to quickly separate Covid-19 patients from those suffering from other maladiesheart attacks, respiratory issues, and broken bones. They must enforce new, strict visitor policies, which sometimes bar relatives from the rooms of dying patients. Theyd like to check on infectious disease patients without entering rooms, which would require another change of still-limited protective gear.
its becoming clear that theyre going to be treating patients with Covid for a long period of time, says Kate Mullaney, a healthcare marketing strategist at the architecture firm HGA, which works with hospitals. She says the firm is aiming for a midterm strategy for hospitals, to get them back to business.
In Springfield, the triage center is only the most visible of Baystate Medical Centers pandemic-related design tweaks, says Kirsten Waltz, the hospital systems director of facilities planning and design. In one week, an in-house engineering team replaced solid doors on patient rooms with glass ones, so healthcare workers can see patients without risking exposure to the virus. It erected glass sneeze guards at nurse stations and reception desks. It limited entries to the hospital, so the visitors still permitted into the facilities are forced to sign in and wear masks when they arrive. In the future, Waltz says, the hospital will consider building more sinks, and constructing storage rooms so workers have easier access to protective gear.

The situation in Springfield does not look as immediately dire as it did when the hospital began constructing its triage area, in mid-March. Massachusetts closed non-essential businesses on March 24, and does not expect its peak in cases until next week. But Baystates workers still feel like they are racing the clock. Were at the plateau right now, says Waltz, referring to the number of Covid-19 cases in the area, which reached 540 on Monday. I think its essential for us to learn in case we have another spike."

LeeAnn is especially concerned because her teenager vapes: This virus attacks the lungs and his lungs are most likely compromised due to vaping!!!!!! she wrote via Facebook messenger. (WIRED is only using LeeAnns first name to protect her familys privacy.)
While serious coronavirus infections are more likely in older populations, teenagers and kids arent immune to the virus. Now, some parents and public health experts are worried that vaping mixed with coronavirus could have terrible consequences. The anxiety level is at an 11 out of 10 about vaping and smoking right now from parents, says Jonathan Winickoff, a pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies tobacco use among children. No parent wants to see their child be placed in a higher risk category.
Plus: What it means to flatten the curve, and everything else you need to know about the coronavirus.
Even cheerleading star and social media celebrity Gabi Butler has exhorted her 1.2 million Instagram followers to quit in a video ad for the Texas Department of State Health Services #VapesDown campaign, in which she warns about the toxic ingredients in many vapes. With everything going on with the coronavirus, you guys want your lungs to be nice and healthy, she says in the video.
Meredith Berkman and Dorian Fuhrman, who run the advocacy group Parents Against Vaping e-cigarettes (PAVe), say they are getting lots of messages from parents even more worried about their kids vaping habits now during the pandemic. Trying to get my 14 year old to quit - doesnt want to, wrote one parent on the groups Facebook page. She says she needs it to help her with stress. Its killing me. Another parent messaged the group asking for strategies to help her husband and her teenager quit. She wrote that Covid-19 is motivating her to get them off this crap.
Not only are parents worried about potential health risks, but, as more families shelter in place together, more parents are finding out about their teens vaping habits. Berkman says that PAVe advocates have been hearing anecdotal stories of parents discovering their kids are more dependent on flavored e-cigarettes than they realized. Now that everyone is at home together, you cant hide that behavior anymore, Fuhrman adds.
Carol Green, president-elect of the California State Parent Teacher Association, says shes heard a different set of concerns from parents who are still working essential jobs at grocery stores, hospitals, and elsewhere. For these families with working parents and no school, theres no adult supervision for their kids. Those parents are really worried about what their kids are doing at home, she says.
This isnt the firstor even the greatestpanic over vaping and lung health. Fears over e-cigarettes and vaping reached a peak in the summer and fall of 2019 when a spate of related lung illnesses now known as EVALI (e-cigarette- or vaping-product-use-associated lung injury) spread across the country, killing 68 people and hospitalizing over 2,000. Many of these patients were previously healthy teenagers who arrived in emergency rooms with symptoms similar to Covid-19, including shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pains. Many ended up on ventilators while doctors struggled to determine treatment.
Although the Centers for Disease Control ultimately linked EVALI to Vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some THC vapes, the illnesses spurred a series of state and city bans on nicotine e-cigarettes and flavored vapes, and moved the federal government to raise the purchasing age for tobacco products from 18 to 21.
There isnt any published research yet that specifically addresses the Covid-19 health risk for vapers, but there is some evidence showing additional risks for tobacco smokers. Data from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control shows that smoking-related diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have raised the death rate for Covid-19 patients. Another study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, found that smokers have higher levels of the ACE2 enzyme that the novel coronavirus uses to get into lung cells. Having more of those entry points could make smokers more susceptible to infection.
Additionally, several earlier studies suggest that vaping weakens the lungs immune response and leaves the body more vulnerable to infection overall. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse both warn Americans that vaping could cause underlying health problems that will complicate coronavirus symptoms.
In September, researchers at Baylor University published a study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation showing that, in mice, e-cigarettes disrupt an important lipid layer in the lungs that traps pathogens, leaving the mice susceptible when exposed to a normally harmless amount of flu virus. Another study by researchers at the University of North Carolina, published in July 2016 in the American Journal of Physiology, revealed that e-cigarette vapor weakens cilia, tiny hair-like projections that help clear mucus and pathogens out of the lungs. A separate UNC study published last May in Chemical Research in Toxicology found the chemicals that give e-cigarettes their cinnamon and vanilla flavoring affect neutrophils and macrophages, tiny cells that help gobble up pathogens before they cause an infection."

But to move too fast is to risk making mistakes.,https://www.wired.com/story/data-sharing-open-source-software-combat-covid-19/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e6ac9edc0b1110009a4db25/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Biz-Nextstrain-ScienceSource_SS22525620.jpg",2020-03-13T11:00:00Z,"On February 27, a teenager in the Seattle area was diagnosed with Covid-19. Shortly after, researchers at the Seattle Flu Study shared genomic data about his strain of the virus with other researchers on an open science site. Armed with that data, researchers involved with a second open science project determined that the teenagers strain was a direct descendent of a strain of Covid-19 found in an unrelated patient in the Seattle area on January 20. The discovery was a key link in concluding that the virus had been spreading in the Seattle area for weeks.
The way researchers connected those dots highlights the role of open science projects in tracking the evolution of Covid-19 and other diseases. Sharing data and working collaboratively across the web, scientists are quickly analyzing genetic samples, helping to shape the public response. But the rush to interpret the data also creates new risks.
Viruses like Covid-19 spread by making copies of themselves. Each time they replicate, there's a chance that an error will be made, making the latest copy slightly different from the previous one. Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral quantitative genetics researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland, likens these errors, known as mutations, to typos in the virus's DNA.
Most of these mutations are trivial, and dont change how the virus affects the body. But scientists can use mutations to track the spread of a virus. If two people in different places are infected with a version of the virus with particular mutations, it's a safe bet those two cases are related, even if the two people never met each other.
In the case of the Seattle area teenager, genetic data about his strain of Covid-19 was uploaded to Gisaid, a platform for sharing genomic data. Then researchers at Nextstrain made the connection with the earlier patient.
Everything you ever wanted to know about Linux, GNU, and how big companies are making money off of free, collaboration-based software.
Nextstrain is an open source application that tracks the evolution of viruses and bacteria, including Covid-19, Ebola, and lesser-known outbreaks such as Enterovirus D68 using data sourced largely from Gisaid. Hodcroft and other researchers involved with the project analyze the data shared on Gisaid for mutations and visualize the results. Thats how the team was able to spot the connection between the two Covid-19 cases in Washington.
Nextstrains work is enabled by the widespread sharing of data by scientists and health professionals. Duncan MacCannell, the chief science officer for the Center for Disease Control's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection, says public health authorities, universities, and clinical laboratories are releasing genomic data from Covid-19 specimens at unprecedented speedoften within 48 hours of a specimen arriving at a sequencing laboratory.
""Nextstrain can be used to give a quick snapshot of how the virus has spread across regions and how local outbreaks are connected,"" says Kristian G. Andersen, a computational biologist at Scripps Research.
Because the underlying code used by the Nextstrain team is open source, other researchers could build their own versions of the Nextstrain site or use Nextstrain's code as the foundation for new projects. More importantly, it also lets other scientists evaluate the scientific validity of the team's work says contributor James Hadfield.
The sort of genetic analysis that Nextstrain does isn't new, in and of itself. Researchers traditionally publish their work primarily through academic journals. But the explosion of genomic data available on Gisaid, and the speed with which it's uploaded, creates new opportunities to bridge the gap between public health and academia, and to enable novice users to explore the data as well.
Skipping the traditional peer review phase has disadvantages. On March 3, Nextstrain cofounder Trevor Bedford, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, wrote on Twitter that a strain circulating in Lombardy, Italy, was related to one found in Munich, Germany, that public health officials had said was contained.

Other scientists disagreed with Bedfords analysis, as noted by Science magazine. For example, Christian Drosten, the virologist at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin who sequenced the Munich strain, spotted the similarities between the German and Italian strains last month and wrote on Twitter that it was ""not sufficient to claim a link between Munich and Italy."" It's possible that the strain arrived in both Munich and Italy from the same outside source, Drosten noted."

Shes a senior in high school, high-achieving, and very driven. We spent the fall slaving over college essays and applications, 11 in total. The wait to hear from the schools she applied to was agonizing for her, and even though todays college admissions messaging is fully electronic, she would even bring in the mail at the end of each dayotherwise unheard of in our householdto see if there was something from a school waiting for her.
Now all we talk about is Covid-19.
The coronapocalypse has been devastating for us adults, but its impact on teenagers is arguably far greater. At age 48, Ive seen a fair number of societys ups and downs. I was born during Watergate, panicked about nuclear holocaust thanks to The Day After as a tween, and watched the first Gulf War unfold on the televisions in my colleges student union. Sure, I wasnt standing in bread lines or facing the firebombing of my city, but the last 48 years have had their share of tragedy and upheaval.
Zoe was born in 2002, a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Things were looking up at the time, and theyve stayed pretty rosy by comparison. Yes, we had the invasion of Iraq, the spike in school shootings, climate change, the 2008 housing crisis, and #MeToo, but we also had an unprecedented explosion in both creativity and commerce. All of the tech services we now love, from Facebook to Netflix, got started in these years. Barack Obama was presidentfor eight years. The iPhone was invented, and they got Osama bin Laden.
Even the election of Donald Trump couldnt take much of the shine off the last two decades. As of 2019, our Goldilocks economy was seeing the lowest level of unemployment since 1969, minimal inflation, and a stock market at its all-time high. Not only was Zoe going to college, we were going to be able to pay for it and she was going to be able to get a job when she graduated.
In the space of a few weeks, none of those things are certain any more, and its hitting her hard.

Everyone has had to abruptly adapt to the new normal, and my initial thought was that kids would take it all in stride. My daughter spends the vast majority of her free time in her room, on her bed, staring at her phone. Would shelter-in-place be any different, aside from not going to school for a few hours a day?
It is, and the impact on Zoe has been profound. She was devastated by the news, and she recentlyafter more than two weeks into stay-at-home restrictionsspoke to me about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of the experience. Im trying to deal with the fact that my high school career is over, she says. Losing track and field, prom, and graduation sucks. And theres no way to cope with it because Im just never going to get to do those things. It feels like the last four years of hard work have been for nothing.
I was suddenly facing the reality that not only were teens ill-equipped for this crisis, theyre actually in a much worse position than adults. Theres science behind this idea, as Psychology Today writer Christine L. Carter notes: Teenagers and college students have amplified innate, developmental motivations that make them hard to isolate at home.

I spoke to nearly a dozen high school students from all over the country and they overwhelmingly echoed the above sentiments. They were taking it in stride to varying degrees, but many were fatalistic about the future. They mourn the losses of (in order of increasing importance) prom, school groups, sports, and graduation. They hang out on video apps and social media with their friends, but they miss seeing them in person. And they miss the ritual of going to class and hanging out with people theyve known for years, even if theyve never been close friends.
Heres some select commentary.
When youre in school you only think about going home, says Emma (17, Novato, California, a classmate of Zoes), and now that youre home, going to school is all you want to do.
Jackson (16, Greenville, South Carolina) misses other rituals. I miss sitting down in a restaurant with my family, which we used to do every Friday night, he says. I just didnt realize how much Id miss normal life.
Zia (16, Denver), a junior who has yet to take any of her college entrance exams, characterizes her mental condition as stressed and getting worse every day as the crisis shows no signs of abatement.
Kam (17, New York) says hes keeping busy at home but, as a graduating senior, is kind of freaked out about going to college after this. Im an only child going from living with no one to living in a dorm.
These are all common sentiments. A new study polled students aged 13 to 25 about their current mood, and the top three results were frustrated (54 percent), nervous (49 percent), and disconnected (40 percent). Teens are anxious, they are upset, and they are nostalgic for February 2020."

(In an emailed statement, Anand Shah, deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs at the FDA, wrote: Per policy, we are not able to comment on whether or not we will take any action regarding emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma and will render a decision at the appropriate time.)
What looked at the beginning of the pandemic like a rare bright spotthat a classic treatment used in pandemics for the past century might prove effective in this one, too, and provide a relatively simple stopgap before monoclonal antibodies and vaccinesnow looks dimmer. Its not that it doesnt work. Its worse than that: Because of failures in the system of how science gets done, nobody knows.
This isnt how things were supposed to happen. Earlier this year, when I spoke to Joyner, he told me about the three trials they hoped to run. Back in March, Joyner saw work validating plasmas use as a bridge to more specific therapieshyperimmune globulin, monoclonal antibodies that attack a carefully chosen part of the virus, and eventually vaccines that build a bodywide response, ideally a permanent one.
It made sense. Plasma has been used for decades. Health care workers tried it against MERS, against the first SARS, against Ebola. More recently, a small randomized clinical trial of plasma on Covid-19 in China published in JAMA in Junejust 103 patientsstopped early but showed indications of improvement. Another small RCT in the Netherlands, published in July as a preprint, didnt show any efficacy of plasma, but it hinted that timing the dose was the key.
Mayo spokespeople declined to make Joyner available for an interview this week, but he has said on Twitter that funding sources turned his groups trials down, that they were more interested in pursuing hyperimmune globulin, a more specific type of blood-derived immunotherapy. Another researcher, who was involved in the construction of the expanded-access program, likewise tells me that they met resistance to their efforts to run randomized trials from the start. We drew up these trials, and we approached multiple federal agencies and private funders to immediately get these trials going, and we actually didnt have a lot of luck with that, says Jeffrey Henderson, a physician and infectious disease researcher at Washington University St. Louis. We had all these trials in the hopper. We were ready to ride the first wave. We figured, were not going to have enough to give to anybody anyway, lets run trials. We just could not get traction. The studies were coming out with now are not the studies we wanted to do. Its people making the best of the situation.
I asked representatives of the National Institutes of Health whether they discussed the studies Joyner proposed, but they havent responded. Henderson told me that the Mayo-led consortium approached the Gates Foundation, a major funder of medical research, and were similarly rebuffed. A Gates Foundation spokesperson says the foundation never received a formal proposal of any kind from Joyners groupand that the foundation is more focused on funding research into hyperimmune globulin. It doesnt require a relatively complex infusion, as plasma does, its more shelf-stable, and might be more targeted as a treatment.
The expanded-access program might have been, in one sense, a victim of its own success. Its planners initially expected to reach perhaps 300 hospitals. They instead ended up with a network of more than 2,700, with 14,000 physicians. The team expected to get 5,000 patients signed up, a mark they passed within a few weeks. The vast majority were at hospitals that had no infrastructure or experience with clinical trials, and wouldnt be expected to run them. At the beginning, the FDA expected a smaller-scale expanded-access program that would be one of three ways people would get convalescent plasma. The other two would be either through an emergency Investigational New Drug (or IND) license that the agency also approved (which would let physicians prescribe plasma they got from other sources), and randomized clinical trials. Patients would get the help they desperately needed, and the proof would come alongside soon after."

In the minds of committed YOLOers, all this Distancer foolishness is threatening everyone's ability to educate their children and keep a roof over their heads.
The YOLOers aren't the only party with serious grievances. The Distancers, a group that I'm a charter member of, have their list of complaints about the YOLOers, starting with the basic fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still nowhere near being controlled in the US to the degree that it is in other countries.
We Distancers don't want to get Covid-19, partly because we've lost seemingly healthy friends, acquaintances, and loved ones to it. We know first-hand that this virus can kill people who are well under 70. Many of us also know Covid long-haulers, people who've suffered severe symptoms for months after they're technically ""recovered.""
Why, we wonder, are the YOLOers asking us to risk our health, when a whole host of other countries at various stages of wealth and developmentfrom Vietnam to Germany to Singaporehave all used testing, tracing, and isolation to get the virus under control to the point where people can safely pack into restaurants without wearing masks? Why won't these YOLOers do the right thing and support a nationwide second lockdown that gets the spread down to a level that we can manage with test-trace-isolate?
Once the virus is contained, so the Distancer logic goes, then we can all open up, together, and begin settling into something that looks closer to pre-pandemic normality.
Like the YOLOers, we Distancers are also keen to get our kids back into school. If only the YOLOers would cooperate with getting the spread down!
Distancers, too, have businesses that are hurting and jobs that are at risk from the economic slowdown. So let's do a second lockdown the right way, and then reopen with a nationwide test-trace-isolate program on the model of Singapore or Germany.
Many of us Distancers would also dearly love to be able to go back to church, attend concerts, eat in restaurants, and do all the things the YOLOers are making impossible with their obstinate disregard for science and public health.
It's not like we're enjoying sitting at home while our YOLOing, Covid-immune friends are flooding social media with happy scenes of late-summer vacations and parties. To a Distancer whose nerves are frayed from months of isolation, each sun-filled photo or new tale of adventures in the outside world comes as a gut punch.
It's hard to say exactly how widespread the divisions outlined above are. Our staff at The Prepared is spread across a number of Covid hot spots, and this divide has been a hot topic for us in recent weeks. Anecdotally, friends from other parts of the country have reported similar conflicts. These dynamics are splitting families and putting friends at odds with each other in places as distant as New Mexico and Wisconsin.
Recent AP-NORC polling shows a fairly stark partisan divide on a variety of coronavirus-related issues. Democrats are dramatically more likely than Republicans to support measures like mask wearing (31-point gap), limiting gathering sizes (36-point gap), closing bars and restaurants (41-point gap), and curtailing all non-essential trips outside the home (36-point gap). Polling from FiveThirtyEight also finds a partisan split on most questions of coronavirus restrictions, with Democrats being consistently more concerned about the virus than Republicans.
As the US approaches the fall season, the YOLOer and Distancer camps can both clearly see the same set of massive social disruptions bearing down on us all.
We're facing a potential wave of evictions, as homeowners miss mortgage payments and renters miss rent. Kids will essentially miss school en masse, and the remote-learning schemes we're now getting in our inboxes from teachers and principals are clearly an improvised joke. We're all still struggling with a historically high rate of joblessness and with empty store shelves brought on by supply chain problems and financial woes."

During Covid-19, they can’t just go to a drugstore.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-postal-slowdown-is-scary-for-those-who-get-meds-by-mail/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f402995a25385db776c0c4a/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_USPS_medications_1210676592-(1).jpg",2020-08-24T11:00:00Z,"Advocates are worried that the elderly, disabled, and chronically ill will be left without reliable access to medicine. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when so many older adults and people with underlying health problems are isolating at home to stay safe, the dangers of being forced to visit a pharmacy are particularly worrying. Its really critical to understand that people that are most at risk of the slowdown of the mail affecting their ability to get medicines and supplies are exactly the population that is most at risk from Covid-19, says Jennifer Goldberg, deputy director of Justice in Aging, a nonprofit that advocates for seniors.
Many of them also depend on the mail for medical supplies like canes, or parts for prosthetics or CPAP machines that help treat sleep apnea. For example, a person who has diabetes might also rely on the mail for a supply of tools for managing their condition like insulin, tubes for insulin pumps, and blood glucose test strips.
A lot of at-home care that happens now requires parts to be sent and replaced periodically, says Aaron Fischer, litigation rights counsel at the advocacy group Disability Rights California. Fischer points out that insurance companies and suppliers have spent years building up a system thats based on the mailso much so that in some places there may be fewer parts available in brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Some medical devices, like insulin pumps, are highly specialized, and local drugstores may not have the right equipment for specific devices or models.
And some medications, like insulin, need to be kept at a certain temperature. Usually, Fischer says, insulin is shipped in insulated containers with a few ice packs. But the medicine cant be out of the refrigerator for weeks at a time. If the mail slows down too much, Fischer worries the medication will be unusable by the time it finally appears at a persons door. Fischer, who has type 1 diabetes himself, says concerns about unreliable mail have made him anxious about whether hell have enough supplies. It's anxiety-producing enough to have a chronic condition that you have to manage every day, he says, and he worries that other people may start rationing insulin to build up an emergency backup supply.
There are benefits to using mail-order services. Refills can be automatic, which makes it easier for people to take their meds every day and comply with doctors orders. For people who dont drive or have access to other transportation, it also removes the barrier of getting yourself to the pharmacy. Thats especially important in rural or tribal areas, where the nearest pharmacy could be hours away. Its not like everybody can just run to their corner drugstore, says David Certner, legal policy director at the AARP. Many seniors have mobility challenges. For those folks, mail-in is critical.
And insurance systems like Kaiser and Medicare encourage using mail-order options by offering customers price deals, like a three-month supply for the price of two. Taking that away, theres an efficiency, reliability and affordability component, says Fischer.
A mail slowdown could be especially devastating for the elderly, many of whom rely on USPS for vital medical and financial information, including updates about Social Security benefits and bank statements. Social Security sends out 350 million notices through the mail each year, so theres a ton of information going out to people thats critical for how they receive their benefits, says Justice in Agings Goldberg. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, 27 percent of people 65 and older dont use the internet. Goldberg points out that older adults frequently prefer to pay their bills with paper checks, rather than using an online payment system. Being able to use the mail to handle basic issues like personal finance is crucial for older people who want to continue living in their own homes and stay out of long-term care facilities, she says."

All around, this has been a tough week. The coronavirus is spreading and worry is running high as infections mount. In economic terms, global markets were repeated declines last night (domestic results here), and the U.S. indices are off again this morning.
There’s been plenty of bad news to read, even in our private market, startup-focused world. Yesterday the impact of COVID-19 on earnings became more apparent, bringing what has, for months, been an external concern to domestic technology companies. The problems are now. The past week’s market collapse into correction territory hasn’t helped,.
But the story so far has largely been public-market focused and with good reason: You can see the public markets contract in real-time. It’s far harder to see into the shifting dynamics of the private market. Today, however, we are going to try, all the same, by digging into some preliminary venture capital data.
I realize that the last few days have been awful. So, at the end of this piece, I’ve excerpted a quote from a recent interview I held with the CEO of Smartsheet, Mark Mader, about tech cycles, downturns, and getting through tough times. It’s perhaps useful today as the downward trend appears to continue.
Let’s start with a brief reminder of how elevated stock prices remain and what that means for tech multiples, and then look at early February VC results from the U.S., China and Europe. With that, in Sanskrit: .

The company has taken steps to minimize the videos reach; but its fact-checks, in particular, appear to have been applied with a curiousif not dangerousreticence. The reason for that reticence should alarm you: It seems that the biggest social network in the world is, at least in part, basing its response to pandemic-related misinformation on a misreading of the academic literature.
At issue is the companys long-standing deference to the risk of so-called backfire effects. That is to say, Facebook worries that the mere act of trying to debunk a bogus claim may only help to make the lie grow stronger. CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg expressed this precise concern back in February 2017: Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas, like showing people an article from the opposite perspective, actually deepen polarization, he said. The company would later cite the same theory to explain why it had stopped applying red flag warnings to fallacious headlines: Academic research on correcting misinformation, a Facebook product manager wrote, has shown that such warnings may actually entrench deeply held beliefs.
Ethan Porter is an assistant professor at George Washington University. Thomas J. Wood is an assistant professor at Ohio State University.
Facebooks fear of backfire hasnt abated in the midst of this pandemic, or the infodemic that came with it. On April 16, the company announced a plan to deal with rampant Covid-19 misinformation: In addition to putting warning labels on some specific content, it would show decidedly non-specific warnings to those whod interacted with a harmful post and nudge them toward more authoritative sources. The vagueness of these latter warnings, Facebook told the website STAT, was meant to minimize the risk of backfire.
But heres the thing: Whatever Facebook says (or thinks) about the backfire effect, this phenomenon has not, in fact, been shown or demonstrated in any thorough way. Rather, its a bogeymana zombie theory from the research literature circa 2008 that has all but been abandoned since. More recent studies, encompassing a broad array of issues, find the opposite is true: On almost all possible topics, almost all of the time, the average personDemocrat or Republican, young or old, well-educated or notresponds to facts just the way youd hope, by becoming more factually accurate.
Yes, its possible to find exceptions. If you follow all this research very carefully, youll be familiar with the rare occasions when, in experimental settings, corrections have failed. If you have a day job, though, and need a rule of thumb, try this: Debunkings and corrections are effective, full stop. This summary puts you much closer to the academic consensus than does the suggestion that backfire effects are widespread and pose an active threat to online discourse.
Weve demonstrated this fact about facts many times ourselves. Our peer-reviewed book and multipleacademicarticles describe dozens of randomized studies that weve run in which people are exposed to misinformation and fact-checks. The research consistently finds that subjects end up being more accurate in their answers to factual questions. Weve shown that fact-checks are effective against outlandish conspiracy theories, as well as more run-of-the-mill Trump misstatements. We even partnered up with the authors of the most popular academic article on the backfire effect, in the hopes of tracking it down. Again, we came up empty-handed.
All those Snopes.com articles, Politifact posts and CNN fact-checks youve read over the years? By and large, they do their job. By our count, across experiments involving more than 10,000 Americans, fact-checks increase the proportion of correct responses in follow-up testing by more than 28 percentage points. But its not just us: Otherresearchers have reached very similar conclusions. If backfire effects exist at all, theyre hard to find. Entrenchment in the face of new information is certainly not a general human tendencynot even when people are presented with corrective facts that cut against their deepest political commitments."

Over the past few months, the insects have rapidly spread north, crossing the Gulf of Oman to infiltrate Iran, Pakistan, and India. The combined damage from locusts, rains, and economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic have now become what the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization has called an unprecedented threat to food security in these regions.
The farmer is hit by the triple threat of locusts, flooding and unusually heavy rainfall in some seasons, and then Covid restrictions, says Lydia Zigomo, Oxfams regional director in the Horn, East, and Central Africa. Which means they can't move their goods to market very easily because of the travel restrictions that have been placed between cities and towns.
The locusts dietary proclivities make it a particularly menacing pest: according to the FAO, an average-sized desert locust swarm can consume as much food as 2,500 people in a single day. In the case of the desert locusts, they're highly polyphagous, which is a nerdy way of saying they're not picky eaters at all, says Rick Overson, research coordinator at Arizona State Universitys Global Locust Initiative. They eat pretty much everything. But that being said, cereal crops are more on the carbohydrate scale and are most susceptible and preferred, and the most heavily damaged economically. Humanitys staple cropswheat, sorghum, millet, ricehappen to be cereal crops loaded with carbs. Once theyve feasted on those carbohydrates, the insects grow bigger faster, accelerating their march.
Even if an East African farmers crops survive the insects, heavy rains exacerbated by climate change might wash away the remaining plants. And on top of that, [farmers] are affected by Covid, says Zigomo. Not so much in this region in terms of the high numbers of infections, but rather the restrictions are impacting measures to try to bring this locust under control, and also impacting the ability of farmers to trade their produce. All of these things are happening at the same time, creating a perfect storm.
If a farmer cant get to market to sell their crops, not only do they lose out on income, but the urban residents who rely on them for food go hungry. So we're talking about 30 to 33 million people being severely food-insecure in this region of Eastern and Central Africa in the coming weeks and months, says Zigomo.
The Covid-19 lockdown has also complicated the fight against the locusts. To be sure, requiring people to shelter in place early in the pandemic is critical for avoiding the even worse economic devastation that would come with runaway viral outbreaks. But Africas fight against the locusts requires constant coordination between the FAO and national governments, and the constant movement of supplies.
Unfortunately, the lockdown coincided with the time when we were importing the bulk of our pesticide equipment and also a number of aircraft and flying crews, says Cyril Ferrand, the FAO's Resilience Team Leader in East Africa. So yes, we have had delays in supply. For example, he says, one pesticide delivery to Kenya was supposed to arrive in mid-March, but only just recently landed in the country.
Luckily, the supply chain for these pesticides and equipment is globally distributed, so a disruption in one exporting country doesnt completely stop the flow of goods. But in the time of Covid-19, deliveries have slowed, leaving crews without the chemicals they immediately need to destroy the swarms before they grow to unmanageable sizes."

India's new contact-tracing app may serve as a lesson in those privacy pitfalls: Security researchers say it could reveal the location of Covid-19 patients not only to government authorities, but to any hacker clever enough to exploit its flaws.
Independent security researcher Baptiste Robert published a blog post today sounding that warning about India's Health Bridge app, or Aarogya Setu, created by the government's National Informatics Centre. Robert found that one feature of the app, designed to let users check if there are infected people nearby, instead allows users to spoof their GPS location and learn how many people reported themselves as infected within any 500-meter-radius. In areas that have relatively sparse reports of infections, Robert says hackers could even use a so-called triangulation attack to confirm the diagnosis of someone they suspect to be positive.
""The developers of this app didnt think that someone malicious would be able to intercept its requests and modify them to get information on a specific area,"" says Robert, a French researcher known in part for finding security vulnerabilities in the Indian national ID system known as Aadhaar. ""With triangulation, you can very closely see who is sick and who is not sick. They honestly didnt consider this use of the app.""
Security researchers like Robert have focused their attention on Aarogya Setu in part due to its sheer scale. The Indian government has declared the contact-tracing app mandatory for many workers and it's already been downloaded more than 90 million times according to government officials.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Unlike many of the apps rolling out across Europe now and soon in the United States, Aarogya Setu traces potentially infected people's movements via GPS rather than Bluetooth data alone. It may represent a cautionary tale about how flawed implementations of contact-tracing appsparticularly those that rely on location datacan lead to serious leaks of sensitive medical information.
""I expect many of the contact-tracing apps to have these types of issues, and I think particularly the ones that rely on GPS are going to be more privacy invasive,"" says Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission lead technologist who reviewed Robert's findings and analyzed other contact-tracing apps. ""When you tie it to something like health status, its not surprising that these types of inferences can be made.""
Robert first recognized Aarogya Setu's privacy problem when he when he analyzed a feature that checks for reports of infected people within a certain radius. He found that by mimicking those requests from his laptop, he could simply spoof his location, altering the queries to ask for the number of infected people in a 500m radius around any latitude and longitude.
That GPS spoofing possibility is troubling enough on its own. If someone lives in a remote area, they could easily be identified as Covid-19 positive. But Robert suggests that the bug could also be used to carry out a technique known as triangulation or trilateration, finding the reported Covid-19 status of someone in a far more targeted location.
""The intended use of the apps is privacy invasive.""
Former FTC Technologist Ashkan Soltani
If a hacker suspects that someone has Covid-19, they could check a series of overlapping 500m circular areas around their target, carefully placing the centers of those circles so that they dont cover their targets home, but so that the edges of the circles create a boundary around it. If each of those 500m-radius areas contains zero infected people, the hacker would then draw new circle, this time positioning its center over the persons home. If the count of sick people goes up by one, the hacker can deduce that an infected person is in that narrowly defined location. If I want to know if the people in a house are sick, I can draw a boundary around it and the application will give me the result, Robert says."

M. Forster published a parable about the solitary endgame of technological progress. In his story, The Machine Stops, the humans of the far future live underground in isolated cells, with all of life mediated through an omnipotent computerthe Machine. In this hive-like complex, Forster writes, people never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete. Contact with others is controlled through buttons in ones cell, which activate Forsters prescient vision of video calling. He describes how one inhabitants room, though it contained nothing, was in touch with all that she cared for in the world. 
We havent climbed inside Forsters Machine just yet, but Covid-19 and the necessary strategies to contain it have certainly narrowed the sensuous aspects of our lives. Touchcontagions fast lanehas become the most ominous of the five senses. Outside the precious seal of the home, every touch must be considered carefully: Do I pick up the basket in the grocery store or stagger quickly around, cradling my canned goods as though theyre a restless baby? Yet we also miss touchs consolations, all those gentle moments of physical contact. We remember the last person we hugged, unthinkingly, outside a bar or leaving a party, drawn together into unexpected intimacy.
With touch now taboo, other senses are being drafted in to compensate. Visual experiences fill in for tactile ones. Early on in the pandemic, the adult site PornHub made its premium content free for locked-down Italians. The business of porn has always been to convert touch into an audiovisual event, commodifying it in the process. This alchemical conversion is a defining feature of the culture of self-isolation.
In the ideal, computer-modeled lockdown, all touches between different households have been paused. Perhaps what we need in this moment, then, is an archive as capacious as PornHub of touching old footage from film and TVthe Love Actually airport scene, the carnival in Grease, Chandler jumping into Joeys arms. Any housebound developers with time on their sanitized hands might consider working on an aggregator for platonic affection. PornHug? ForlornHub? Thank you, Ill be here for the foreseeable future.
In the Covid era, keeping in touch is the new touching. There was an arcane time when I said the word zoom out loud about once a year, but those days arent now. When I teach a virtual class or join a virtual faculty meeting, I brace myself for the almost complete sensory deprivation of the first few Zoom seconds. Im getting to know that lull, that loud silence of the default muting, before peoples audio feeds kick in, one by one.

A wave was developed to attract attention at a distance, and yet, via the webcam, were in each others faces. So are we far apart or intensely close? The dizzying answer is: both.
For practical reasons, Zooms conference settings turn speech into a spectacle. In Active Speaker mode, the person talking floods the visual field; the screen becomes a stage for our temporary overlord. If you choose Gallery Mode, the speakers hutch is framed in glowing chartreuse. Im reminded of William Goldings Lord of the Flies, in which the group of stranded schoolchildren, literally isolated on a desert island, devise the system of the conch to determine who can speak in meetings. Only the boy holding the shell may make a declaration.
All this seeing and being seen is producing a new kind of fatigue. Its tiring to be so relentlessly spectacular. Zoom offers some solutions to this visual overload. Virtual backgrounds, which are meant to limit the power of our digital sight, create a shield against the intrusion of professional life into private spaces. Once youve loaded up your backdrop, you exist for others in a kind of non-place, somewhere thats neither your room nor their room. And to give a full retreat into public-privacy, there is the stop video option, so that a seminar becomes a conversation between stern movie credits or petrified profile pictures. They say that hearing is the last sense to go."

Located in central Milan, it boasts four stars and close proximity to tourist attractions. Not that those things matter much to its recent guests: Theyre forbidden to leave. 
As part of efforts to contain Covid-19, which has claimed more than 34,000 lives across Italy, Milanese authorities have converted the 17-floor hotel into a quarantine facility. It opened March 30 with enough space for 300 patientsmostly people well enough to be discharged from hospitals, but who still test positive and dont have the space to isolate at home.
It feels like a hospital, says photographer Alberto Bernasconi. The smell, the cleaning products, the nurses wearing scrubs and masks. Its completely different from the normal daily life of a hotel.
Bernasconi visited in April, donning full protective gear to capture an inside look. A flurry of medical staff filled the polished reception area, now draped in plastic like a construction zone. When guests arrived, they were sent up to their rooms via a specially-designated Covid-19 positive elevator, not to emerge for weeks.
The stay is free and typically lasts 14 to 21 days, or until patients test negative twicean eternity when youre stuck alone in a 200-square-foot room, unable to hug your loved ones. The only humans they see are the nurses who stop by to check their vitals and take swabs. Meals arrive in paper bags hung on the door handles three times a day. Fresh sheets and towels are delivered once a week. They never leave their rooms at least, theyre not supposed to. The manager told me that there was a party with three people just talking and drinking and having a good time, Bernasconi says. He was really pissed and sent everyone back to their rooms.
Bernasconi visited several patients to shoot their portraits, keeping his distance and limiting talking. The images drip with ennui and anxiety. Everyone just wants to leaveand even more, to return to life as it was before the pandemic, back when Hotel Michelangelo was just a place people crashed after a fun day of seeing the sights."

Now they're flipping the switch.,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-pandemic-ransomware-long-game/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ea7654addad8f0008fac716/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Security_ransom_1217476186.jpg",2020-04-28T16:02:57Z,"The novel coronaviruspandemic has stretched the world's health care systems to their limits, creating a global crisis. New research from Microsoft shows that ransomware attackers are actively making that crisis worse, forcing health care and critical infrastructure organizations to pay up when they can least afford downtime. In many cases, hackers are reaping the rewards of groundwork they laid months ago, before Covid-19 fully hit.
Hackers have known for years that hospitals and other health care providers make perfect targets for ransomware attacks, since there's life or death urgency in getting back up and running quickly. During the pandemic, though, the risk has become even more dire. After a hospital in the Czech Republic was hit by a debilitating ransomware attack in March, the country's cybersecurity oversight agency warned two weeks ago that it was bracing for widespread cyberattacks against critical services in the country. Two Czech hospitals reported attempted attacks a day later, and the United States State Department threatened consequences if the antagonism continued.
The Czech incidents reflect just one corner of a worrying global trend of opportunistic ransomware activations.
""The attackers are definitely being what Ill call rational economic actors, which unfortunately also means vicious,"" says Rob Lefferts, corporate vice president of Microsoft 365 security. ""We see behavior where they will break into organizations and actually lie dormant, both because theyre doing reconnaissance, but also because they are apparently estimating what is the moment in time when that organization will be most vulnerable and most likely to pay.""
An initial attack that might give hackers access to a victim's network. But they'll then wait weeks or months for a particularly opportune moment to actually infect the system with ransomware. Microsoft has been tracking such behavior from groups using a number of prominent strains of ransomware, like Robbinhood, Maze, and REvil. While some ransomware groups had pledged not to attack hospitals during the coronavirus crisis, in practice hackers are increasingly attempting to cash in.
The Microsoft researchers often observed attackers getting their initial network access by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in victims' web infrastructure. They saw some hackers taking advantage of a widely publicized flaw in the Pulse Secure VPN and others exploiting flaws in remote management features like remote desktop systems. Attackers also targeted vulnerabilities and insecure configurations of Microsoft's own products. Attackers could guess passwords of organizations using Remote Desktop Protocol without multi-factor authentication, or exploit known bugs in Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Exchange servers that victims neglected to patch.
Attackers even took advantage of tools used in security to proactively find and plug network holes, including the attack emulation platform Cobalt Strike and malicious techniques in Microsoft's remote management framework PowerShell. This activity often looks legitimate and can sneak past scanners, allowing attackers to lie in wait and do reconnaissance undetected on the network until they choose the moment to actually strike.
While attackers wait for the right conditions to release the ransomware, they often exfiltrate data from their victims' networks. The motive of this activity isn't always clear, though, Microsoft says. It can be difficult to tell the difference between attackers who have IP theft or other intelligence gathering as their main goal and those that just collect what they can as a secondary benefit of positioning themselves for ransomware attacks.
Microsoft's Lefferts emphasizes that attack groups can't be reliably traced by the tools or type of ransomware they're using, because so many groups copy each other or use different techniques against different targets. And he says that while most of the activity simply capitalizes on known vulnerabilities, ransomware groups are generally smart about rotating their infrastructure like IP addresses to make it harder to trace them."

In a recent analysis of neighborhood demographic data, Covid-19 case reports from the department of health, and ridership data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, her research team discovered that in New York City the disease spread quickest through neighborhoods where people lived in overcrowded homes and couldnt telecommute to their jobs. Population density never seems to matter, says Gould Ellen. The higher-density neighborhoods were not the ones hit most by this pandemic. What does seem to be a significant issue is crowding. In other words, its not the density of housing that mattersits the number of people living together in those homes.
While theres still a lot more to learn about the specific transmission dynamics of local outbreaks, she says the same principles should apply to non-urban areas. Meat processing plants are just one example: Prisons, homeless shelters, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships all follow a similar pattern. If you stick a bunch of people in close quarters for long periods of time, the virus will inevitably spread.
Since the outbreaks began, JBS USA has begun offering a $600 bonus and $4 per hour wage increase to its workers. Those who are absent for health reasons, including testing positive for Covid-19 or being exposed to someone who has, are being paideither regular wages or short-term disabilitywhile not working, according to Richardson, the company spokesperson. No one is forced to come to work and no one is punished for being absent for health reasons, Richardson wrote. JBS USA will not operate a facility if we do not believe it is safe or if absenteeism levels result in our inability to safely operate.
As JBS USA and other big meat processors struggle to keep their plants running, the US food supply isnt going to collapse, says Jayson Lusk, a food and agricultural economist at Purdue University. But there are going to be some disruptions that consumers will feel almost immediately. In the last week, wholesale pork prices have spiked sharply, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. Wholesale beef prices are now the highest theyve been in two decades. Grocery stores will probably dampen that some, so consumers wont be exposed to that full cost, says Lusk. But its inevitable that in the coming days well all be seeing higher meat prices in the store.
In some parts of the country its already happening. This week, nearly one-fifth of Wendys restaurants ran out of burgers, The New York Times reported. Kroger and Costco are limiting their shoppers purchase of fresh beef, poultry, and pork. In the near term, such shortages are likely to be sporadic and limited to certain geographic regions, at least for pork, says Lusk. Thats because going into the Covid-19 crisis, pork producers were ramping up production in anticipation of selling huge quantities to China, where African swine fever wiped out half the countrys hog herd in 2019. As a result, the big US pork producers have 10 days worth of meat in cold storage that they can release when and where its needed.
That wont last forever, though. With plants shut down or operating at reduced capacity, pig farmers are already having to euthanize animalsas many as 10,000 a day in Minnesota alone, according to The Star Tribune. Theres less economic pressure regarding beef cattle, because ranchers can continue feeding them on pasture at minimal additional costs. Pork production has less slack in the system. Feeding animals in finishing barns is expensive, and if they get too big, slaughterhouses wont take them because theyll overwhelm processing equipment. You start getting backlogs of piglets in nurseries, then in farrowing houses, and finishing barns, says Lusk. If you cant get market hogs out the door, something has to give. With so much uncertainty, farmers are less likely to keep young animals moving through the system and to continue breeding sows. A half year from now, there are going to be far fewer pigs in the US than this time last year."

From phishing attacks to unemployment fraud, attackers have put new, more exploitative twists on their classic hustles. And now the Federal Trade Commission is warning that those fraudsters have designed scams around state contact-tracing initiatives.
You've probably heard a lot about contact-tracing mobile apps, but state health departments have also been ramping up manual programs staffed by trained volunteers. The idea is to ""trace"" people who have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, and advise all those who may have been exposed to quarantine strictly at home and monitor for possible symptoms. For all of this to work, contact tracers need to get in touch with lots of potentially impacted people, and many states are sending text alerts to call contact-tracing hotlines. But given that scammers are already adept at blasting out misleading SMS text messages, contact-tracing communications have become a compelling communication to co-opt for fraud.
""Theres no question, contact tracing plays a vital role in helping to stop the spread of Covid-19,"" Colleen Tressler, an FTC consumer education specialist wrote in an alert on Tuesday. ""But scammers, pretending to be contact tracers and taking advantage of how the process works, are also sending text messages. Theirs are spam text messages that ask you to click a link. Dont take the bait.""
The malicious text messages can include links that either download malware onto your device with one click or take you to a phishing page that tricks you into inputting personal data or a password. One sample SMS scam provided by the FTC reads, ""Someone who came in contact with you tested positive or has shown symptoms for Covid-19 &amp; recommends you self-isolate/get tested."" It then prompts the target to learn more by tapping a URL. Such malicious texts could also direct you to call a fake hotline to continue the ruse and grab your information there.
""Because there hasn't been a lot of communication yet about what an 'official' contact-tracing notice would look like, users have few ways to ascertain whether what they received is a scam,"" says Jake Williams, a security consultant and founder of the firm Rendition Infosec. ""This is only complicated by the fact that messages might differ across regions, health departments, etc.""
The flurry of new programs and services set up in response to the pandemic can certainly be hard to keep up with. The FTC points out, though, that there are still some basic touchstones you can use to spot a scam. For example, real health department contact tracers will never ask you for your Social Security number, credit card details, or other financial information. And they won't ask you to send money anywhere or participate in any type of transaction.
""In our experience, the most successful scam pretexts do two things. First, they put a user into a state of confusion by introducing a new challenge. Second, they compel the user to act,"" Williams says. ""Covid-19 contact tracing is a great example of something that does both. The actions the victim must take, including clicking a link, downloading a document, or submitting information are plausible.""
No one would fault you for a trap during a pandemic, but there are precautions you can take to minimize your risk. Make sure you have two-factor authentication set up on as many of your online accounts as possible. That way even if a hacker gets one of your passwords they'll still have a tough time actually getting in. Make sure you're keeping up with software and operating system updates to plug as many holes as possible against malware. And look into filters and blocking services if you're really being inundated with junk calls and texts.
The pandemic and corresponding world economic crisis are stressful enough, but as official contact-tracing programs ramp up, it's unfortunately necessary to discern the real alerts from the scams."

So while their article is under review at a journal, the researchers might also publish the paper on a preprint server, like bioRxiv, founded by the nonprofit research center Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, or medRxiv, which was founded by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Yale University, and the medical journal BMJ. These sites are meant to make information quickly accessible, and they also allow researchers to get feedback from members of the scientific community beyond their peer reviewers. While preprints are screened for offensive or nonscientific content, anything that might pose a health risk, and plagiarism, they arent reviewed or edited before they go up.
Experts say these papers are essentially drafts, and caution that readers should be wary about immediately drawing big conclusions from them. Part of the function of a preprint is to alert other people in the community to possibilities that they might want to investigate, says Cassandra Volpe Horii, the founding director of the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach at Caltech. I would say we have to treat any preprints as an informal part of the conversation.
And during the hurry to publish during the pandemic, even articles published in well-respected journals should be approached with some skepticism. Normally with papers, you can sort of trust that theres been a fairly robust peer review process, where other scientists, experts, have weighed in, says Stuart, of Johns Hopkins. Those reviewers would build on their expertise and look at the body of evidence already available in the field to help them evaluate a new study. But with Covid-19, Stuart says, the information is new and changing rapidly. Reviewers are swamped and have to rely on their own judgement more than they typically would.
Retraction Watch, a site that follows scientific papers, lists over 20 Covid-19 papers that have been retracted from preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals since February 2020. Some, like this study on the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks, were retracted because the data analysis in the study wasnt sound. Others, like the study that found hydroxychloroquine was linked to a higher death rate in Covid-19 patients, were retracted because the authors had relied on a private company for the data and never had access to the raw data themselves. In June, scientists urgedPNAS, a high-profile journal published by the National Academy of Sciences, to retract an article about the effectiveness of masks, claiming it relied on poor statistical analysis.
With so many scientists from different fields and specialities jumping into coronavirus research, sometimes they make mistakes because they arent experts in a particular field. Just because someone is expert in one area does not mean theyre expert in another, says Stuart. If a paper seems strange, she recommends looking up the authors in the study and making sure their expertise lines up with the topics the paper covers.
And if a paper isnt published in a journal or on a preprint server at all, but instead shows up on a personal website or as a press release without any data attached, thats probably a bad sign. I think we just need to have some cautious optimism when we see these press releases without data, says Kate Grabowski, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins who works on the NCRC. Press releases might offer hopeful headlines, but without a peer-reviewed study, they dont offer any substantive proof that the news is true.
If a reader wants to dive into reading primary literature, Caltechs Horii says they shouldnt approach a study like a book or a news article. Any sort of expert communication is going to have its own efficient ways of conveying information to a peer group, she says. She compares scientific studies to knitting patterns: They have their own vocabulary and set of rules that readers need to understand in order to be able to read them."

He noticed that students and teachers were lumped together in a Sharepoint ""user group"" and had all been granted the same access to files stored in the system. This meant that students could access anything on the Sharepoint, including each others' data. One file was labeled as containing student usernames and passwords and was simply an unlocked, plaintext spreadsheet of student login credentials for school accounts.
Polk County Schools did not return a request for comment on Henry's research. At the July 2019 meeting where Henry shared his findings, though, members of the school board appeared to support his work. ""I've directed him multiples times to our IT staff,"" Billy Townsend, the school board representative for Polk County's District 1, said. ""I think he's done some very useful things, from what I understand. I think we should take seriously what he's saying.""
Henry also found and reported similar vulnerabilities in the systems of two private Florida universities last year. He says that making all of these discoveries while he was still a student motivated him to pursue a career in ed-tech cybersecurity.
""When I took a look, there was so much that was vulnerablejust a stupid amount of vulnerability,"" Henry says. ""It doesnt feel good. When you participate in a capture the flag hacker competition or do a cool bug bounty, it feels good to find stuff, but you see these flaws in education systems and theres nothing to be proud of as a researcher. You changed a number or you just looked! Im not some genius. It's just very obvious that nobody else is looking.""
After some especially dramatic cyberattacks against schools in the fall, including multiple situations where districts had to cancel class because of ransomware attacks, researchers say that there started to be momentum toward making cybersecurity a priority in school systems around the country. But Doug Levin, founder of the consulting firm EdTech Strategies, which compiles data on K-12 cybersecurity incidents, says all of that ground to a halt when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
""Suddenly everything shifted on a dime,"" Levin says, recalling how schools raced to set up infrastructure for online learning en masse. ""It went into that mode where everything is built with rubber bands and toothpicks. Get everyone working and learning remotely, distribute devices to students, connect to local printers, deal with forgotten passwords, whatever. People should be concerned about the technical decisions they were making. And even with a bit more time to plan for the fall, it's all still very fluid.""
There's no single, comprehensive source of reporting on K-12 digital security incidents in the US. Levin created the Cyber Incident Map to track as many publicly disclosed attacks as possiblecompiled from legal disclosures, news reports, and research findings. But the tracker likely undercounts actual total incidents by a significant margin since so many are kept under wraps and never go public.
In the last three months, Levin has been surprised to see a decrease in the number of public accounts of K-12 cyber attacks, though they're certainly not gone altogether. It's unclear if this actually represents a downtick in the number of incidents or whether other factors are at play. Levin also points out that there may be a new digital infection spike in the fall when students, teachers, and administrators physically go back to school and plug their devices into hardwired networks for the first time in months.
While the pandemic has fueled new exposures, it has also simply accelerated a digitization that was already in progress across K-12 educationa phenomenon seen in virtually every industry. Given the cracks that already existed in schools' digital defenses, it's more vital than ever to take precautions now."

This story originally appeared on WIRED UK.
Criminals working for the hacking group Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), also known as Cozy Bear, have been caught attacking pharmaceutical businesses and academic institutions involved in vaccine development. Officials in the three countries believe these have been attempts to steal intellectual property and information about potential vaccine candidates.
The hackers used custom malware thats not been previously linked to Russia and a number of publicly known vulnerabilities in widely used software, such as VPNs. These have been accompanied with spear-phishing attempts that have looked to gather login details to internet-accessible parts of the organizations targeted.
Theyre so confident in the attacks emanating from Russia that the UKs National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC), Canadian Communication Security Establishment, and various US security agencies, including the NSA and Department for Homeland Security, have decided to publicly call out APT29. The public shaming is the latest in an increasingly hostile approach to hacking by groups working on behalf of Russia and comes at the same time as an admission from the UK government that Russia tried to influence the 2019 general election.
APT29 is widely believed to be linked to the Russian intelligence services and has been involved in a high number of cyberattacks in recent years, including the hacking of the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 US presidential election. On the US hacks, APT29 worked alongside fellow Russian hackers Fancy Bear and APT28.
We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic, Paul Chichester the NCSCs director of operations said in a statement. The NCSC also published an advisory notice detailing the efforts it had seen from APT29 in its attacks on vaccine developments. Officials have not commented on whether the attacks were successful but also have not ruled out that this is the case.
The advisory issued by the cybersecurity groups hints towards there being some success even if this is just scoping out potential elements of organizations that are vulnerable to attack. In recent attacks targeting Covid-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organizations, the NCSC guidance states. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified.
The NCSC also states that APT29 has been successful in using publicly known vulnerabilities to gain initial footholds in the universities and businesses it has been attacking. The advisory lists a number of well-known vulnerabilities that APT29 looked to take advantage of. These include flaws within Citrix networking systems and VPNs. It is believed that once details of the vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed, the state-backed actors have been quick to attempt to exploit them in an attempt to strike before security experts can implement fixes.
Upon gaining access to a system, the group likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access, the NCSC says in its warning notice. The actor is likely to use anonymizing services when using the stolen credentials.
In some of the incidents seen by the NCSC and its US and Canadian counterparts, APT29 has deployed custom malware. They believe this to be the WellMess malware and a new version, called WellMail. The malware has been in use since at least 2018, the NCSC says. WellMess is a lightweight malware designed to execute arbitrary shell commands, upload and download files. The malware supports HTTP, TLS and DNS communications methods, the cybersecurity body says.
Its not the first time during the pandemic that hackers have sought to gain advantage of the ongoing health crisis. There has been an increase in attacks against businesses as employees have moved to work from home, with hospitals and other medical organizations also targeted.
The APT29 attacks against vaccine groups are continuing, the NCSC says. Its advisory concludes by saying: APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in Covid-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.

The Boston area had been inundated with Covid-19 cases, and at the time, tests remained scant. But the university had come to her with an unfathomable question: In four months time, how would they test students and staff when they returned to campus? The university didnt have its own testing lab. So Klapperich, who studies medical diagnostics, was tasked with designing one. 
We had an empty room, Klapperich says. Actually, we didnt even have an empty room. We had a room we had to empty. Her team worked to repurpose the space, in both physical and bureaucratic terms. That meant getting the right clinical licenses to perform diagnostics tests and deliver results, plus trained staff to do it. And then filling the room with a battery of robotic instruments, sequencing machines, reagents and nasal swabs. With all that, Klapperich hopes, the university will begin testing faculty, staff, and students on a regular basis next month, with capacity for roughly 5,000 tests per day.
That testing is at the center of a strategy to aggressively monitor the school for outbreaks, with isolation dorms on a remote patch of campus for anyone who gets sick, contact tracing staff, and apps to let students report symptoms and stay up-to-date on tests. Universities have become a microcosm of the pandemic strategy the government has largely failed to enact. Were all the federal government now, Klapperich says.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, public health advocates have boiled down virus containment to a few simple steps. First, get the virus under control using the blunt tools of isolation and social distancing. And then, as those measures soften: Test, trace, isolate. The process of quickly identifying exposed people, coupled with behaviors that are by now common-sense, like wearing masks, washing hands, and limiting large gatherings, would keep the viruss spread, at the very least, to a much slower creep.
We all know how thats gone. Six months into the pandemic, few places in the US have the virus under control, with the Northeast (for now) one of the major exceptions. But next month, hundreds of thousands of college students will return to campus all the same, often in places where outbreaks are actively raging, or soon could spark. Universities must keep the pandemic at bay, all while trying to maintain for students some of the benefits of being physically on campus: to socialize, to work in labs, to participate in events and activities. All the things that classes via Zoom dont permit.
We cannot keep them locked up in their dorms. Theres no point, says Amy Gorin, a behavioral psychologist at the University of Connecticut involved in reopening efforts there. So how do we approximate the normal experience without compromising on safety?
Large research universities have a leg up in offering tests. They can create pop-up labs that draw from existing resources, as schools like Boston University and UC Berkeley have done, or look to affiliated hospitals for helps. Some smaller campuses have taken a collaborative approach. A number of colleges across New England, including Wellesley, Colby, and Williams, recently signed on to send test samples to the Broad Institute, a research center affiliated with MIT and Harvard that has opened its high-throughput Covid-19 lab to other educational institutions. Others must compete for capacity at commercial labs.
But far more universities have instead opted against surveillance testing, reserving testing for students who show symptoms or have a known risk of exposure. Thats in line with current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says there is not enough evidence from testing on college campuses to determine whether it is useful or not.

Residential college campuses may appear, in some ways, to be well-suited to handling the pandemic. Theyre filled with young people who are less likely to experience severe cases of the disease, and who wont bring their germs home each afternoon to mom and dad. But in other ways, theyre porous, says David Paltiel, a professor of public health policy at Yale University. Even in the sluggish, depopulated days of summer, a number of universities have seen outbreaks in places like frat houses and sports practices. Plus, the risks are uneven. If the virus moves fast within a population of college students, its the older professors, janitors and dining hall workers who bear the risk. We all worry about the safety of students, but the cost of a mistake is likely to be borne by the most vulnerable members of the community, he says."

Rivers, who has called for the creation of a national infectious disease forecasting center in the mold of the National Weather Service, observes that Right now, theres nobody responsible for really recording and archiving who said whatwhat did modelers say, and what happened. What prediction did they make today, and how does it change tomorrow, how does it change the next day, and how does that relate to what actually happened?
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Weather modeling and epidemiological modeling have some important differences. One is that weather forecasts are made many times every day, for every location in the country. This allows for the rigorous evaluation of forecast skill. Pandemic forecasts are made rarely (thank goodness), meaning that we cant know that much about their accuracy, even when we have to rely on them. Another important difference is that weather forecasts dont change the weather, while forecasts of disease outbreaks may influence how people respond and behave, and thus alter the conditions being forecasted.
For these reasons, pandemic forecasting presents a much greater challenge than does weather forecasting. This is why we really dont want to ever have to rely on pandemic forecasts. It will always be much better to stop a pandemic before it starts, which requires effective surveillance and strategies for quick intervention. That fact only makes the absence of the federal government in producing or evaluating coronavirus models more alarming.
In its place, we have a free-for-all. The plethora of pandemic models looks like a big bowl of cherries to political partisans, who can pick and choose whichever results seem most supportive of their favored policies or damaging to their opponents positions. We have seen similar dynamics in the climate debate, where scientific arguments can be just Trojan horses for views grounded in politics, economics, or culture.
Most notably, on April 1, Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force showed a figure indicating that successful social distancing would limit the number of US deaths to between 100,000 and 240,000. Those numbers have, in turn, been laid out by the administration as the metric of policy success in the pandemic: Any five-digit body count, no matter how high, shall thus be counted as salvation. Never mind the fact that these estimates have been widely criticized by experts as being unrealistically high in the first place, including by Trumps own advisers.
The almost complete lack of transparency from the White House is like gasoline poured on a hot fire of politicized science.
In this instance, the White Houses use of coronavirus forecasts appears to be for purposes of evading accountability for poor decisions or justifying decisions already made, in addition to whatever role they had informing policy. Unsurprisingly, the White House has not released details on its projections; and task force member Deborah Birx only referred, in presenting them, to five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial [College London]. The model from the University of Washington also has been frequently cited by the task force, but another with less aggressive projections, which would be far less favorable to evaluating the White House response, was dismissed as an outlier.
The almost complete lack of transparency from the White House is like gasoline poured on a hot fire of politicized science. As a consequence, both supporters and critics of the Trump administrations policies cite bits and pieces of research to support their arguments, but the absence of a broader scientific context for interpreting the pandemic forecasts means that everyone lacks a rigorous, authoritative basis for their views. This is convenient for political battles, but fatal to effective policy development or evaluation.
It is true that the widely cited University of Washington model has been shown to produce deeply flawed projections. Of course, we should expect that any newly developed and untested model deployed in a completely novel context will produce poor forecasts. To expect otherwise is to misunderstand the difficulty of such modeling. That is precisely why it is important to compare side-by-side forecasts from all available models. Looking at a diversity of models can help us to characterize areas of agreement and uncertainty."

For photographer Kennedi Carters family, as well as many others, this meant that Easter was spent in their living room, with the couch as the pew and the television as the pulpit. 
Toward the end of sermons, the congregation would normally get so hyped, says Madison Cater, Kennedis sister. People would start shouting and getting up and running around. That energy just isn't there anymore.
The Carter family portrait has been an annual tradition for the last four years. This is the first time Kennedi photographed them using black-and-white film. I think black-and-white has an ageless quality to it and that's something I wanted to bring into the photos, she says.Photograph: Kennedi Carter
Typically, her Easter Sundays are filled with the aromatic mixture of cinnamon rolls and the chicken that was being prepared for dinner later in the evening. In the past, her mother, Felicia, would twist her hair and decorate the ends with barrettes, a hairstyle that required, at the very least, a moderate amount of hair grease. Madison would habitually rest her head on her mothers lap during the middle of the service, and later realize shed left a massive oil stain on her dress and pretend it wasnt there. She'd feel some kind of way but I always thought it was funny, she says.
This past Easter, though, was much more muted. Felicia didnt do Madisons hair. The family didnt buy new Easter clothes for the at-home occasion. And the egg baskets Felicia usually made for her god-daughters, Jaelle and Jocelyn, didnt exist. The Carters simply gathered in their downstairs living room, slowly trickling in to watch Bishop Clarence Laney, Jr. livestream his sermon from the local Monument of Faith church. Onscreen, he was joined by a handful of choir members, assisting ministers and parishioners from the worship team, all distancing from each other.
I think thatespecially below the Bible Beltwe feel church has to be under a roof and it has to take place in a specific place. But as someone who has not been routinely going, I feel like church is wherever you make it, Kennedi says.

Facebook also did good this week, managing to add safety alerts to its Messenger app to let people know when a scammer or worse might be on the other end of the chat, all without breaking the end-to-end encryption of its Secret Conversations feature.

Apple keeps unreleased versions of iOS a closely guarded secret; even when an iPhone 4 famously leaked before it launched, the software remained a mystery. But it appears that an early version of iOS 14 has fallen into the hands of the iOS jailbreak community, according to a report this week in Motherboard. There had already been some hints that iOS 14 was out there; Apple news site 9to5Mac reported that it had seen leaked code back in March. But the apparent extent of the leak means hackers have ample time to prod the update for vulnerabilitieswhich could be trouble when iOS 14 actually launches.
European airline EasyJet revealed this week that a cyberattack had resulted in the personal information of nine million customers being stolen. Over 2,000 victims also had their credit or debit card information accessed, further exposing them to theft or fraud. EasyJet said that ""highly sophisticated"" hackers were behind the operation, and that it suspects that the target was intellectual property rather than customer data, but it's unclear what it's basing that assessment on.

(Mayonnaise, clearly.) But this holiday, you might not have as many wieners to argue about.
Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy. 
Across the US, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has rampaged through cold, cramped, meat processing facilities, sickening thousands of workers and killing at least 30 of them. With dozens of plants closed or cutting back operations, meat shortages have been forcing some grocery stores to ration grilling staples like ground beef and chicken breasts. At least one sausage factory, in Milwaukee, has had to hit pause on its hot dog production line.
But on the other side of the ocean, inside Europes largest pig slaughterhouse, the only visible sign that theres a global pandemic going on is in the break room, where every other chair has been spirited away to leave conspicuous gaps between any would-be socializers. Otherwise, its business as usual. Thats because, at this meat plant, robots do most of the work.
At 5:20 am, the first pigs start arriving on straw-lined flatbed trucks. While darkness still covers the nearby seaside town of Horsens, Denmark, coveralled workers herd the animals into pens inside a hulking 90-acre facility owned by Danish Crown, the biggest meat processing company in Europe. An hour or two later, automated partitions nudge them, a few pigs at a time, out of the pens and into a gas chamber where a blast of CO2 knocks them out. Moments later, they spill onto a conveyor belt where a worker wearing a waterproof apron and elbow-length gloves cuffs one of each pigs rear feet to a moving production line, which hoists the animal overhead. Another worker inserts a knife into the pigs carotid artery, and an attached vacuum hose siphons out the blood. Thats when the robots really take over.
An infrared laser-emitting robot first measures each pig carcass. Next up, the so-called rectum loosener robot uses computer vision to identify the pigs tail, cuts a 4-inch hole around it, and extracts whatever poop is inside. Then the feces-free carcass moves into a cabinet-like robot, where a large, circular blade splits the pig from sternum to ham. Next, each one moves onto a mechanized, autonomous organ remover, tendon slasher, and finally, the spine splitter. Ten minutes. Six robots. Minimal human supervision. By midnight, when the second (human) shift calls it quits, 18,000 pigs will have passed through this gauntlet of actuated steel and knives.
Danish Crowns Horsens facility isnt just one of the largest pig slaughterhouses in the world, its also, by most accounts, the most modern. (And the most transparentin pre-pandemic times, it hosted hundreds of visitors a week. Today you can still take a virtual tour.) But heavy automation is a feature of all 18 of the companys in-country meat processing facilities. And its one reason that might explain how Denmarks slaughterhouses have so far escaped becoming Covid-19 hot spots. According to a Danish Crown spokesperson, among the companys 8,000 employees in Denmark, fewer than 10 workers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. None of its slaughterhouses there have had to close or slow down production.
There are likely other explanations and contributing factors, toolike Denmarks early adoption of lockdown measures and its robust nationalized health care system. But scientists who study the meat industry say the rest of the world should take note. The new realities of social distancing mean rethinking the layout of all kinds of workplaces, including slaughterhouses. In the US, these facilities are characterized by cramped, loud, icy conditions that make it easier for the coronavirus to stay alive and jump from person to person. Robots could help keep workers safe and meat plants running."

A presenter will speak in the recipients language and address them by name, while explaining some basic concepts in artificial intelligence. The videos themselves will be powerful demonstrations of what AI can do: The face, and the words it speaks, will be synthesized by software.
WPP doesnt bill them as such, but its synthetic training videos might be called deepfakes, a loose term applied to images or videos generated using AI that look real. Although best known as tools of harassment, porn, or duplicity, image-generating AI is now being used by major corporations for such anodyne purposes as corporate training.

WPPs unreal training videos, made with technology from London startup Synthesia, arent perfect. WPP chief technology officer Stephan Pretorius says the prosody of the presenters delivery can be off, the most jarring flaw in an early cut shown to WIRED that was visually smooth. But the ability to personalize and localize video to many individuals makes for more compelling footage than the usual corporate fare, he says. The technology is getting very good very quickly, Pretorius says.
Deepfake-style production can also be cheap and quick, an advantage amplified by Covid-19 restrictions that have made conventional video shoots trickier and riskier. Pretorius says a company-wide internal education campaign might require 20 different scripts for WPPs global workforce, each costing tens of thousands of dollars to produce. With Synthesia we can have avatars that are diverse and speak your name and your agency and in your language and the whole thing can cost $100,000, he says. In this summers training campaign, the languages are limited to English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Pretorius hopes to distribute the clips, 20 modules of about 5 minutes each, to 50,000 employees this year.
Were saying let's remove the camera from the equation.
Victor Riparbelli, CEO and cofounder, Synthesia
The term deepfakes comes from the Reddit username of the person or persons who in 2017 released a series of pornographic clips modified using machine learning to include the faces of Hollywood actresses. Their code was released online, and various forms of AI video and image-generation technology are now available to any interested amateur. Deepfakes have become tools of harassment against activists, and a cause of concern among lawmakers and social media executives worried about political disinformation, although they are also used for fun, such as to insert Nicolas Cage into movies he did not appear in.
Deepfakes made for titillation, harassment, or fun typically come with obvious giveaway glitches. Startups are now crafting AI technology that can generate video and images able to pass as substitutes for conventional corporate footage or marketing photos. It comes as synthetic media, and people, are becoming more mainstream. Prominent talent agency CAA recently signed Lil Miquela, a computer-generated Instagram influencer with more than 2 million followers.

From now on, per a new Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, hospitals can more easily order transfusions of Covid-19 convalescent plasmaa blood product using donations from recovered patients, and containing disease-specific antibodies. It has been proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent, Trump claimed. Its a tremendous number. 
Then FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn added his support. I dont want you to gloss over this number, he told the press. What that means isand if the data continue to pan out[out of] 100 people who are sick with Covid-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of that plasma.
Trump and Hahn were right about one thing: This would be tremendous, if only it were true. Its not.
In fact, as WIREDs Adam Rogers wrote on Sunday, nothing has been proven on this topic: there havent yet been results from any decent-sized, randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma, so no one can say for sure whether it offers any benefits at all. But its somehow even worse than that: Trumps numberthe purported reduction in mortalityis even wrong on its own terms.
But lets not jump ahead. To understand the disturbing implications of this moment for the FDA, its helpful to retrace some recent steps. It was Hahn, the FDA Commissioner, who kicked this issue into overdrive on July 30. Thats when he called on people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate their plasma: You can literally save lives, Hahn claimed, even though he couldnt back that up with evidence, as the government launched an $8 million PSA campaign. The accompanying press release made it clear to all that a clock was ticking: The Trump Administration is imploring Americans to dramatically increase donations of convalescent plasma by the end of August, it said.
We learned more about what had been going on behind the scenes on Aug. 1, at a seminar at the Mayo Clinic. Peter Marks, the head of the FDA section responsible for drug authorizations and approvals, filled in the backstory. From early on in the pandemic, the FDA was overwhelmed by doctors making applications to use convalescent plasma on individual patients. Instead of pulling out the stops to enable a large clinical trial to get reliable data quickly, the agency asked the Mayo Clinic to set up and coordinate an Expanded Access Program, and gather safety information. As the plasma became widely available through this program, and outbreaks shifted around the country, existing clinical trials ran into trouble: few were willing to take a chance on being randomized into the control arm of a study, when the treatment was quite accessible.
By the start of August, thoughand despite the dearth of trial dataPeter Marks was clearly convinced both that convalescent plasma was safe to use, and that what he called the totality of evidence suggested it had real benefits for patients. What made him so confident? He cited four lines of research: First, studies of the use of convalescent plasma in prior outbreaks of disease, including influenza; second, related studies using animals with Covid-19; third, the small clutch of published studies involving human Covid-19 patients; and fourth, an analysis of data from the Mayo Clinic, based on 35,000 of the patients who had participated in the Expanded Access Program. These all pointed in the same direction, he said, and added up to make a compelling case for convalescent plasma.
The Mayo study was pivotal, and ended up the source for the presidents whopper-claim on Sunday that the treatment is proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent, and the follow-up from the White House Director of Communications, claiming that this benefit might, in fact, be as high as 50 percent. (These are REAL American lives that will be saved, she tweeted.) But of course, the Mayo study couldnt prove that."

Over the weekend, Tropical Storm Fausto propelled moisture from off the coast of Baja California up into the Bay Area, spawning rare summer thunderstorms. At the same time, the region has been baking under an intense heat wave that has desiccated vegetation, which all-too-easily combusted when those thunderstorms rolled through. Since Monday, almost 400 wildfires have broken out, most of them sparked by lightning. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated across Northern California, and 350,000 acres have burned so far. Overextended fire crews have contained very little of it thus far, a still more wildfires continue to ignite across the state.
All of this is happening during a pandemic, which has killed almost 12,000 Californians, forcing people to remain sheltering in place at home. And to make matters even worse, in the middle of a heat wave, they cant open their windows because air quality is now astonishingly bad as smoke continues to pour into the Bay Area. (Witness the awfulness in real time with this map.)
Currently, there is a wildfire burning in every county in the San Francisco Bay Area, except for San Francisco, says Kristina Chu, acting communications manager at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. So it's just insane the amount of smoke. The Air District and the Bay Area in general have experienced wildfires in the past, we recognize that. But it hasn't been at this level. And that's why there is so much smoke everywhere.
The district has extended its Spare the Air alert, which in this case directs people to not burn anything, all the way through Sunday. The agency is recommending that residents remain indoors with the windows closed, and that those with air conditioning units should only run them with recirculating air.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Temperatures inland have been regularly soaring over 100 degrees, which brings twin evils. For one: Having to stay inside with the windows closed carries heat exposure risks for the elderly. These risks include heat stroke (which can lead to loss of consciousness), and heat exhaustion (which can lead to dizziness and quick and shallow breathing). Chu says that if need be, residents should seek out cooling centersfacilities where people without AC can go to cool off. (While wearing a mask and keeping socially distant, of course.)
And theres a second evil: Heat leads to the formation of ozone, which conspires with smoke to erode local air quality. Both pollutants togetherand especially if folks are already dealing with preexisting conditionsis very dangerous, to say the very least, says Chu. Even by itself, smoke may carry some risk during a pandemic. Covid-19 is at least in part a respiratory disease, and smoke inhalation may make the body vulnerable to infection by tampering with the lungs ability to expel viruses and bacteria.
Californias firefighters are struggling to contain an extraordinary number of massive wildfires, compounded by logistical challenges brought on by the pandemic. This is a pretty major fire siege that we're in, so regardless of Covid, there are challenges, says Christine McMorrow, communications officer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as CalFire. Because of Covid, we are down some of our inmate crews. Outbreaks in prisons have taken invaluable firefighters out of action; inmates also help with logistical support, like serving food in camps that house crews and other support staff. Accordingly, California officials had to call in firefighting reinforcements from out of state.
These fire camps can be absolutely massive and are usually set up in open spaces like fairgroundsthey contain thousands of first responders, government officials, plus the media milling about. In the spring months leading to fire season, CalFire had to not only scout where to set up these camps should massive wildfires break out in the summer or fall, but also had to figure out how to set them up with adequate social distancing. So essentially, what we're doing is just more, McMorrow says. More tables for eating, more tents and space for the different areas of operation within that fire camp. More hand-washing stations, more places where people can spread out."

Google says it saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams just in the past week. Thats on top of the more than 240 million daily spam messages it sees related to the novel coronavirus, the company says. 
The phishing attacks and scams use both fear and financial incentives to create urgency to try to prompt users to respond, Google says. In other words, same email scam, different subject line. 
These scams include impersonating government organizations like the World Health Organization to try to solicit donations or trick users into downloading malware; pretending to have information about government stimulus payments; and phishing attempts aimed at workers who are working remotely. This scammer pretends to be affiliated with the recipients employer:
Google say its artificial intelligence-powered protections filter such threats, and that it blocks more than 99.9 percent of spam, phishing, and malware from reaching our users using AI and other techniques. The company also says it worked with WHO on implementing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to make it more difficult for scammers to impersonate the who.int domain and prevent legitimate emails from the WHO from being caught in spam filters.
The company says in many cases the malware and phishing threats arent new but just existing malware campaigns updated to exploit fear and confusion around COVID-19. The usual cautions apply: dont click links in emails you werent expecting, report phishing emails, and make sure a URL is legitimate before providing any information, since most scammers try to closely approximate real URLs."

By the end of today, the Covid-19 American death toll will surpass that of Hurricane Maria, the 2017 storm that devastated Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.
And yet, as Americans locked at home prepare to enter their second month living this unprecedented, still-unfolding, and worsening crisisan event that in its suddenness, response, and wide-ranging effects seems to encompass multiple crises, part-Depression, part-9/11, part-grotesque natural disasterthe United States continues to experience a titanic leadership void. For months, as the coronavirus has migrated from an epidemic overseas to a full-blown global pandemic and epic economic calamity, America has waited, hungrily, for leadership and inspiration.
The Covid-19 pandemic is a clear opportunity for history-making leadership; given that the nationand the world beyondfaces a threat and a challenge unlike anything else in modern history, a crisis that is simultaneously unfolding in nearly every community, city, county, province, and state, and country on the planet, the opportunities for leadership would seem to be endless. Yet the scale of the economic and public health calamity seems to dwarf the imagination of most of our nations leaders.

To understand why our leaders have collectively struggled in this crisis, one must understand what makes for successful crisis leadership: Just as detectives weed out suspects by thinking about means, motive, and opportunity, past crises have shown there are traditionally four ingredients required for transcendent leadership: opportunity, boldness, frankness, and capability. Leaders need all four to come together for greatness to be thrust upon them by future historians.
So far, weve not seen anyone assemble all of those ingredients. No single leader has emerged to embody the hope and inspiration in the model of Rudy Giuliani on 9/11, FDR of the Great Depression and World War II, Hank Paulson of the financial crisis, or, during Hurricane Katrinaafter the nation watched the fumbling by George W. Bush and FEMA director Michael Heckuva Job Brownie Brownthe swashbuckling, impossible-to-ignore Rajin Cajun Gen. Russel L. Honoré. Erik Larsons new book about Winston Churchills leadership during the Battle of Britain tops todays nations bestseller charts, even though (and perhaps because) none of us have seen a leader rally the country in the way that Churchills stoic nature and stirring words promised that his nation would never be defeated.
Quite the opposite: The challenge for the country so far in the Covid-19 spring is that one by one, most of the leaders weve traditionally turned to have fallen flatinternationally, nationally, and locally.
Frankness has been in short supply at the White House, for one. After spending weeks downplaying the threat of the emerging epidemic Donald Trump has repeatedly since failed to heed Harry Trumans The Buck Stops Here mantra for the presidency. I dont take responsibility at all, he said at one early coronavirus press conference. His Oval Office address on the crisis was a disaster, the stock market has seen huge plunges as hes spoken, and hes badly fumbled some of the most basic softballs about how to reassure a nation in extremis. His inability to muster the slightest empathy for those involvedhe mocked news that Senator Mitt Romney is in self-isolationremains perhaps the least presidential aspect of his ability to rise to the occasion.
Boldness, in both decisive action and good models of behavior, has been lacking in the national response, too. Coronavirus press conferences, which crowd the nations top leaders together and has featured no shortage of handshaking, send precisely the wrong message at a time when social distancing is the mantra for the countrynot to mention literally endangering those involved from a continuity of government perspective. FEMA director Pete Gaynor, who belatedly was put in charge of the federal governments virus response just days ago, similarly fumbled his public debut last weekend and has spent the week trying to catch up in a nearly impossible Herculean task.
Congress, as is often the case during major crises, seems incapable of stepping into a national leadership void. Its become a bickering, partisan after-thought at best and an institution filled with thoughtless, head-in-the-sand opportunists at worst; senators apparently sold their personalstocks after receiving confidential briefings on the virus impact, and Senator Rand Paul tested positive for Covid-19 on a day where he spent the morning working out in the Senate gym and lunching with colleagues.
That lack of decisiveness and inspiration has also rung true at the local level. New York Mayor Bill de Blasios response to the crisisat a moment when New York faces a historic epidemic and death tollhas had all of the moral authority and urgency of a collapsed, week-old soufflé. Beyond his hemming and hawing, he was roundly criticized for trying to squeeze in one last workout before his favorite YMCA gym closed to the public.
(And, of course, after enduring his rapid reputational descent of recent years, his butt-dials, conspiracy theories, and too many Bloody Marys, its worth nothing that todays Rudy Giuliani is clearly not the bold Rudy of yore: Earlier this month, he tweeted about what an insignificant death toll the novel coronavirus actually had yielded thus far. By last week, he was downplaying the viruss significance, and over the weekend he was suspended from Twitter for spreading misinformation about the virus.)"

Samples scraped from the back of patients noses and throats can now be bundled together and tested for the coronavirus in groups in one of the countrys biggest commercial labs. Quest Diagnostics, which handles tens of thousands of coronavirus tests each day, received authorization for the method, called pooled testing, from the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend. 
The strategy helps conserve resources by running multiple tests using the materials usually required for one. It could also help Quest avoid backlogs and move testing along more quickly. Right now, demand for testing is so high that it takes an average of seven days for Quest labs to get results to patients. 
However, the strategy cant clear all testing roadblocks, and it may not work as well in the areas where its most needed: outbreak hotspots, where testing resources are stretched the thinnest. In those environments, where a high percentage of tests turn out to be positive, pools dont end up saving materials too many are positive, which means more retesting. 
When the positivity rate is high, pooling is not very effective.
When the positivity rate is high, pooling is not very effective, because youre splitting apart way too many pools, and its just not worth your effort, says Peter Iwen, director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory.
Quests method will combine samples taken from four people. If the multi-sample test is negative, all four are considered negative. If its positive, each sample gets retested on its own to figure out who has the virus. The company said in a press release that it will start rolling out pooled testing at its labs in Chantilly, Virginia, and Marlborough, Massachusetts, by the end of the week, before expanding to other locations. Quest did not respond to a request for comment. 
Experts have been interested in pooled testing for months. The method is already commonly used to screen people for sexually transmitted infections, and its used to check for diseases in donated blood as well. Deborah Brix, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told an American Society for Microbiology conference last month that the strategy could dramatically increase the number of tests done in the US each day. 
Back in March, Iwen started exploring pooled tests in the Nebraska Public Health Lab. He was running low on the chemicals needed to run each test and knew that he could conserve them by grouping samples together. He ran some experiments and found that he could do it successfully. It works great, and I can save anywhere from 60 to 70 percent of our reagents, he says. He got approval to move forward from Nebraskas governor under their state of emergency. 
We started pooling, and we were able to keep the lab operating, Iwen says.
Shortages of testing materials is just the type of roadblock a pooled testing strategy can help overcome, says Nikhil Gopalkrishnan, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvards Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. But supply shortages arent the only issue holding up testing. Depending on what the actual problem is, pooling can make a real impact, or it could not, he says. If it turns out that theyre short staffed, and they just dont have enough people, and the limiting factor is that someone has to unscrew all the tubes pooling is not going to help you there. 
Depending on what the actual problem is, pooling can make a real impact, or it could not.
Pooling also doesnt help once the rate of infections in a community starts ticking up. Iwen had to stop using pooled testing in the Nebraska lab a few weeks back because the percentage of tests that came back positive was too high above 10 percent. In any random group of four or five tests, there was a high chance that one would be positive. If the positive rate is that high, pooling doesnt tend to save a significant amount of chemicals or time. 
The new instructions for the Quest pooled testing say that, if 13 percent of tests done at a lab are coming back positive, the lab should drop the pool size down to three. If 25 percent of a labs tests are coming back positive, they shouldnt do pooled testing. Virginia and Massachusetts, home to the first Quest labs set to use pooled testing, positivity rate is about 6 and 2 percent, respectively. In Arizona, one of the hardest-hit states, its around 24 percent. 
Its possible to make pooled testing work in an area with a high percentage of positive tests, Iwen says. If they have information about patients (if they have symptoms, where they live, where they work), they can classify them as high or low risk. You could pool the ones that you think are considered low risk. You could do that in any place, even if their overall rate is very, very high, he says. 
That only works if labs can get good demographic information on the samples theyre testing. But often, labs get samples and have no idea where they came from, Iwen says. 
Despite the limitations, Gopalkrishnan says that the Quest authorization is a good first step toward more widespread pooled testing. Hed like to see bigger pool sizes, particularly in areas where there isnt much spread of COVID-19. Bumping pools up to tens of samples, or as high as 100, could help labs move through samples even more quickly. I think youll see more pooling authorizations come in, he says. 
Iwen thinks that implementing pooled testing properly can help testing move more quickly. This is a process that needs to be considered if were going to do the testing thats been asked of the laboratories, he says. Turnaround time is important, if it has an impact on that, its worthwhile.

 We’ve got to be ready for the long haul If you’ve been marking the pandemic by the pileup of cautious reopenings and rescheduled events, you might think that an end to this global disaster is in sight. Event planners for the Kentucky Derby and Bonnaroo already have new opening days on the books in September. The Olympics are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 23rd, 2021. There’s just one problem: if anyone says that they know exactly when this pandemic will be over, they are lying. 
No one can see the future. The virus is an unknown player, and the best minds on Earth can’t do more than make educated guesses about what comes next and when. Hell, we didn’t even notice the blood clot situation until just recently. 
I know. A guess is not comforting when you’re dreading another week of monotony in the same four walls. End dates are comforting. Reopenings are comforting. Contemplating a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present. But let’s not confuse comfort for truth. 
a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present

When bowling alleys and tattoo parlors reopened in Georgia on Friday, the pandemic was not over. It won’t be over when the stay-at-home order in Michigan (maybe) lifts on April 30th or if the stay-at-home order in the Bay Area actually ends on May 31st. 
The dates politicians are throwing around are not finish lines. They aren’t guesses at an end date for this pandemic, either. Shelter-in-place orders are just time-outs. We have no sure-fire treatments for the virus, no vaccine, and a limited supply of health care workers. To keep as many people alive as possible, we’ve done the only thing we can do to slow the spread: we’ve hid from each other.
The virus’s effects have not been, as some proposed, a great equalizer. The less you have, the harder you’re hit. The federal government has mostly failed at leading a coherent response to the pandemic. Doctors are clashing with the FBI over PPE, then running into the ER with whatever they can scrounge up. Governors are hitting up their private-jet-owner friends to have masks flown in from China to equip their hospitals. Nurses at other facilities are resorting to wearing garbage bags in an unsuccessful bid to avoid contracting the virus on the job. 
People who are already vulnerable are getting hit the hardest. Death rates have soared in black communities already slammed by other public health crises. On the Navajo Nation, experts worry that water shortages are contributing to the virus’s continued spread. The virus has raged through cramped homeless shelters and through the communities that can’t afford to distance themselves. “It’s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,” an ER doctor working in Elmhurst, Queens told The New Yorker. “People hear that term ‘essential workers.’ Short-order cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers—that is the patient population here.” In some US prisons, the vast majority of inmates are testing positive for the virus, leaving incarcerated persons in fear for their lives. One inmate, Sterling Rivers, grimly observed that “Our sentences have turned into death sentences” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Our failures around the coronavirus are systemic failures of public policy.
Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries

Those failures have left the health care system struggling to cope, plunged society into a well of uncertainty, and sent the economy cratering. Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries. Twenty-six million people have filed unemployment claims. 
And so some governors will call an end to stay-home orders in the hopes of resuscitating their economies. In Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee, that time came on Friday. Other states, like California and New York, are taking a longer view, gradually easing some restrictions on movement while enforcing new requirements — masks on, low temps, can’t lose. 
As cases decrease, restrictions will relax. But once we let our guard down, we’ll likely see resurgences of cases, once again straining health resources — leaving us with no choice but to close ourselves off again. That’s what’s happening in parts of China now, where new outbreaks of the same disease have emerged. The open-and-shut economy will likely continue as cases ebb and flow. 
There are paths to victory, but as Ezra Klein notes at Vox, “these aren’t plans for returning to anything even approaching normal.” Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don’t have yet. Scientific discoveries will help defeat the virus — but science can’t do it alone. Public policies will play a huge role, and even with firm health guidelines and speedy scientific developments, it will take longer than we want for us to truly eke out a win.
What does a win look like? It will take widespread tests of everyone who might be sick and careful quarantining of anyone who tests positive. It will take armies of contact tracers to trace down anyone who might have been exposed. These low-tech interventions are the best thing we’ve got while we give researchers the time they need to come up with other solutions.
Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors

Scientists will labor over vaccines and treatments, but the overwhelming majority of their trials will turn up nothing useful. They’ll also keep trying to understand the virus and our bodies’ complicated response to it, in the hopes of developing legitimate antibody tests. Eventually, we may discover something that destroys the virus without wrecking our bodies. But none of that is ready today.
The end is still likely to be a long way away, as journalist Ed Yong writes in The Atlantic: “The pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world.”
Consider this a rebuilding year. It might even turn into rebuilding years, depending on our progress. Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors. Even antibody testing isn’t ready to be called up to the big leagues, at least not yet. 
This is a long game, and focusing on the victory celebrations — like New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s plan to “throw the biggest, best parade to honor” health care workers — won’t get us to the end. 
If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed

If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed. We’ll feel defeated every time a drug fails in testing. We can’t let it get to us like that. The parades, the ballgames, the worship services that we’re looking forward to, those will be there once this is over. What we’ve got to ensure now is that when we get to reopening day — whenever it is — that our concert halls and stadiums and spiritual homes are filled with as many of our human siblings as we can possibly save. 
It still sucks when the goalposts move from April 15th to April 30th, then to May 15th. It feels like we’re Charlie Brown and the end to this is a football that Lucy keeps pulling away. But when it comes to the virus itself, the clock isn’t the statistic that matters. These are the ones that do: numbers of tests, numbers of new infections, and numbers of bodies in the morgues. 
When the numbers of tests go up and confirmed cases and deaths go down, then our playbook will change. But it won’t be the end of the fight — not yet. 
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars

We play this through to the end — there is no other option. Victory might look like a vaccine. It might look like a robust testing regime or a new treatment. It might look like us cobbling together a sense of normalcy and still watching for repeated outbreaks. Whatever form it takes, we’ll fight our way there with masks, thermometers, and soap, buying some time along the way. We’ll adjust our playbook as the virus adapts. We’ll position ourselves farther apart. We’ll do it again, and again when the next waves of this virus come. We will be exhausted when we get there, but we will get there. But if we don’t pace ourselves for the long haul, it will be that much harder to get through.
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars. All we can do is get through today, pushing our leaders to get the people on the front lines the resources and time they need to get us through this. We need politicians who will stop telling us the comforting things we want to hear and start acting to keep as many of us alive as possible."

 On January 8th, I asked The Verge’s science team to keep an eye on early reports of a new virus that had recently emerged in China. When I dropped an article about that new virus from The Washington Post in Slack, someone joked that 2020 was off to a strong start, clearly jinxing the entire year for the rest of humanity. Whoops. 
Jokes aside, this past decade

, six and a half months has featured a disturbing flood of terrible, horrible, no good, very bad news. More than half a year in and not only do we still not know when this will all end, we’re also seeing a tsunami of new cases in the US and record-high hospitalizations.

Studies provide glimpse at efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and CanSino: A top COVID-19 vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response and didn’t produce severe side effects, according to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet. The study focused on a vaccine candidate made by Oxford University and Astra-Zeneca and involved nearly 1,000 patients. Another study, also published in The Lancet, found that a vaccine produced by Chinese company CanSino Biologics produced an immune response but wasn’t as effective in people over age 65. Both drugs will now have to complete phase three trials and be tested on hundreds, if not thousands more people. (Matthew Herper, Damian Garde, and Helen Branswell / Stat) </li>

Some Vaccine Makers Say They Plan to Profit From Coronavirus Vaccine: Executives from pharmaceutical companies testified before Congress on Tuesday and four of them were optimistic that the world would have a vaccine by late 2020 or early 2021. Two, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, said they would produce the vaccine at cost. Another two, Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer, did not. (Katherine J. Wu / The New York Times)</li>
<li>
In related news: On Wednesday, Pfizer and German company BioNTech announced that they were jointly receiving $1.95 billion from the US government to develop 600 million doses of a vaccine. They join other companies who have already received commitments of federal funding. Moderna is getting $483 million, Johnson and Johnson is getting $456 million, and AstraZeneca is getting $1 billion.</li>
<li>
Notes of caution — While most of the executives put a rosy timeline before Congress, other experts are more skeptical. Fauci told The New York Times that families were not likely to see a vaccine until next year. “I think it’s going to be sometime in 2021. I don’t know whether that’s going to be the first quarter of 2021, the first half — it’s difficult to say,” Fauci said.</li>
</ul>
Immunology experts have also been cautious, and so have other pharmaceutical executives. “I think when people tell the public that there’s going to be a vaccine by the end of 2020, they do a grave disservice to the public,” Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said in an interview hosted by Harvard Business School last week. “I think at the end of the day, we don’t want to rush the vaccine before we’ve done rigorous science.”

Want to help researchers find a vaccine? The National Institutes of Health (NIH) created a new network called the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) that will help connect volunteers with some of the large clinical trials that are needed to test potential coronavirus vaccines. 
“Each of the Phase 3 clinical trials that the COVPN will conduct will require thousands of volunteers,” NIH director Francis Collins said in a statement. “Community engagement, particularly with the communities most vulnerable to COVID-19’s severe outcomes, will be critical to the success of this research endeavor.” 
If you want to volunteer, you’ll be asked to complete a short survey of personal questions, including where you live. If you’re a good candidate for one of the many studies going on across the country, a researcher will reach out to you and give you more information on the study. You can then decide whether you want to participate.

But epidemiologists caution thatprivacy concerns asidethe scheme will be limited use in combating Covid-19 because of the technologys constraints, inadequate testing for the disease, and users reluctance to participate.
The Apple-Google proposal, announced Friday, is designed to record when two people come near one another without revealing their identities or location. It relies on Bluetooth technology, a short-range wireless protocol often used to connect phones to devices such as headphones.
Apple and Google say they will create software allowing phones to broadcast unique, cryptographically generated codes via Bluetooth. The codes wont include identifying information or location data, and the cryptography is designed to make it impossible to tie the codes to a particular person.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Other phones would record these codes when they come nearby, perhaps within 10 or 15 feet. Each phone would store the codes it receives for 14 days. When someone reports a Covid-19 infection, their codes will be uploaded to a central server. Other phones would periodically check this list to see if they had received any of those codes, indicating that the owner had been close to a person who is infected.
Apps that use the contact tracing scheme could automatically alert public health authorities and provide users with information regarding testing and self-quarantine. Before the Apple-Google announcement, dozens of research groups and cybersecurity professionals had proposed similar digital contact tracing efforts, some of which also used combinations of Bluetooth and cryptography to guard user privacy.
The plan is designed to automate the laborious process known as contact tracing, through which public health officials seek to control the spread of an infectious disease by identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person, then testing and isolating those people so they cannot spread it to others.
The scale and nature of the coronavirus pandemic make digital tracing appealing. An analysis published in the journal Science on March 31 suggests the coronavirus spreads so quickly through people who are contagious but not sick that it would be difficult to contain through conventional manual tracing alone.
It is the way of the future, says Michael Mina, an assistant professor at Harvards Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Why do we have individual people going to peoples homes, putting themselves at risk, when we have all of this digital information?
Nonetheless, epidemiologists caution that digital contact tracing may not be a panacea for the coronavirus outbreak, in part because in much of the world, tests are reserved for those with clear symptoms. In the US, fewer than 3 million people have been tested, according to the Covid Tracking Project; thats less than 1 percent of Americans. The effectiveness of contact tracing relies on identifying people who appear healthy but are carrying the virus; if those people arent tested, their contacts wont be recorded.
Why do we have individual people going to peoples homes, putting themselves at risk, when we have all of this digital information?

The only way that these sort of things can be effective, if we take that model from other countries, is if you test far more cases than come up positive, says Sham Kakade, a computer scientist at the University of Washington and a coauthor of PACT, a similar set of contact tracing protocols. This kind of alert also needs to be adjusted to how many tests we can give.
Another hurdle for the Apple-Google approach is convincing users to participate. The companies say they hope to make available next month software known as an application programming interface (API). Public health authorities would create apps that connect to this API, allowing phones to share their codes.
Sensitive to concerns about user privacy, the tech companies say users will have to install one of these apps to become part of the system. But many users may not use the apps, eroding the value of the system.
To be effective, contract tracing apps need roughly 50 percent to 70 percent of a population to use them, according to an analysis by researchers at the open-source contact-tracing project, Covid-Watch. Otherwise, symptomatic people wouldnt know where they contracted the virus and asymptomatic people would continue spreading it unknowingly.
Singapore introduced such a contact tracing app on March 20. There, in a society considered far more disciplined, and with fewer privacy concerns, than the US, fewer than one-fourth of smartphones have downloaded it nearly a month later.
In the US, anxieties over big tech and government surveillance could further inhibit adoption. One can imagine all sorts of people, whether it's people who have family members who've been in trouble with the law or are undocumented, who will avoid any kind of contact tracing, says Susan Landau, a cybersecurity policy expert at Tufts University. For many of these people, she says, contact tracing is actually scary for them rather than beneficial.
The only way that these sort of things can be effective is if you test far more cases than come up positive.

Even if testing is adequate, some researchers worry that the scheme will report too many contacts, potentially overwhelming public health officials with people who think theyve been exposed to the virus and prompting users to question the value of the system. Bluetooth signals typically reach about 30 feet, far wider than the 6 feet considered an acceptable distance to not spread infection.
Apple and Google say app makers can fine-tune the system to report only closer contacts.
Even if an app only recorded contacts within 15 feet, for example, Bluetooth cant easily distinguish if an infected person was within 6 feet for a length of time, or behind a glass wall, or in the apartment next door, or wearing a mask and gloves."

The crew at Bessemer released their new, yearly cloud report this week. It’s a useful lens into how venture capitalists are thinking about cloud and SaaS startup performance metrics. Bessemer’s cloud and SaaS exits include Twilio, Shopify, PagerDuty, Box, and a few others, so they’re worth listening to at least a little on the topic.
I bring all this up as I finally got the chance to read the 2020 report (here, if you want to dig through it yourself, and here’s the 2019 version for reference). I’m going to chat with Bessemer’s Mary D’Onofrio about some numbers from the presentation next week, but this morning I wanted to discuss the report’s SaaS and cloud startup scorecard.
Bessemer likes to invent metrics, something that I approve of. In 2019, the firm debuted a G.R.I.T (“ARR growth, retention, years of runway, and efficiency”) score that was a bit complicated. This year the report included a six metric rundown of “good, better, and best” startup cloud and SaaS startup performance.
Let’s chew over the set of SaaS metrics that investors, before COVID-19, were looking for. Next week we’ll find out if Bessemer has changed any of them in light of the new economic collapse cum malaise.
TechCrunch has a general rule against screenshots of text, but today there’s no way around it. Here’s the pertinent summary slide from the Bessemer report:"

Henry Chu, 41, insurance underwriter, New York City: My wife was scheduled to be induced on Tuesday March 24th. Last Sunday afternoon, a friend of ours in New Jersey whose wife was also pregnant said he wasnt going to be allowed in the delivery room because of the Coronavirus. I started Googling for news about our hospital, Mount Sinai. As of March 17, it said that one partner was going to be allowed. But that Sunday, New York Presbyterian announced its going to be limiting partners. I started getting nervous. My wife was pretty calm about it, but I figured other hospitals would follow suit. I kept searching on Twitter Mount Sinai Mount Sinai. Then we got a note on Tuesday from our doctor saying they were going to start enforcing the no-partners policy. Then we started freaking out. The day of our delivery it went into effect.
On Tuesday, we brought our other two daughters along to the hospital. It was very eerie. The roads were quiet. Even the ER entrance was very quietwe were expecting a line of ambulances to get in, but there was almost no one. Outside the main entrance, I hugged her. She hugged the kids. I couldnt even walk through the door. I watched her walk up to the reception, then someone escorted her away. It was such a weird feeling. It didnt feel right.
The doctor said they understood it was a unique situation, so they allowed us to FaceTime during labor. They set up the iPad so I could witness the birth, but its not the same. The girls watched their mom, talked to their mom. I sent them away for the actual delivery. The angle wasnt great. I didnt even realize when the baby came out. I could see my wife, but not the baby. They ended up picking up the iPad and showing me our baby. Once the baby was out, I called the girls over too to see. I got choked up. It was relief.
We were hoping theyd be released Wednesday. Theyre trying to get moms and babies out of that environment as quickly as possible, but there was something with the babys glucose levels so they kept them for another night. When I pick her up, I cant even go inside. Ive got to wait outside.
All I know is I will never be able to say that I was there holding my wifes hand the day she was born.
Ryan Carroll,high school senior, Loudon County, Virginia: It started small for me. I heard about people being infected in China, then the first cases in Italy. Even when cases reached the US, I never thought it would impact my day-to-day life.
On Thursday, March 5, I attended the meeting for my high school bands annual spring trip. My band director assured us that he would keep us updated on whether we would be able to go on the trip that year. This is when it started to become real for me. Three days later, our trip was canceled. Now, I know that I will never perform with my band ever again.
On Wednesday, March 11, I walked out of my high school for the last time ever. I will never attend my school again as a student. We had no idea that schools would closefirst until March 20, then until at least April 10, and then for the remainder of the year. I attended a bonfire in my schools parking lot that night. I left early, because I wanted to get up early to go to the gym the next morning. Im convinced I saw friends and faculty for the last time ever that night. On Thursday, March 12, I did not go to the gym. It had closed overnight, along with most other noessential businesses.
I will not have a senior prom, a senior trip, a senior picnic. I will not walk across a stage at my high school graduation and hug my principal and receive my diploma. I will probably not be hugging, or even shaking hands, for months.
Aliza Goldberg,communications specialist, Virginia: I have been with my boyfriend for three years; he lives in London now. Wed lived together for a year and half, and then I got this job in Virginia, so we knew it was going to be long-distance for a while. I hadnt seen him since mid-December, when I started the new job. After March, my hope was that wed have a sense of normalcy in our relationship and could start doing long weekends visiting each other. Id booked a flight for the 19th and was supposed to return on the 25th.
I work in communications, so I read the news everyday. I have a masters in international affairs. Id been following this since before it was relevant to my daily life. I was aware of what was happening. I still had this romantic vision of being quarantined with my boyfriend in London. That was when the UK was not taking this seriously at all. Everyone was saying if you dont have underlying issues, youll be fine. I was thinking, Im 28, Ill be fine. That felt like it was so long ago. It was just last Monday."

The moderators were keen to operate best practices from a public health perspective, but werent always sure howespecially when there was limited official health advice available. Several of us have science backgrounds so we can moderate some content but none of us are pandemic experts, Emilia says. This is a wedding planning subreddit!
They first automatically redirected all coronavirus-related posts to the pinned Daily Discussion thread, but the automoderator didnt catch every post and some people got upset when their posts were removed or redirected. It sounds easyall coronavirus threads in one placebut there were a lot of nuances we didnt anticipate because we got so many different variations on the topic, Emilia says.
By March 15, the moderators were struggling to keep up with demand and the public health situation in the US and Europe had changed significantly. The mods introduced a daily COVID-19 Megathread, which is now the first thing people see when they visit the subreddit. Comments are divided into months of the year, so members can easily find other wedding planners working to a similar timeline.
Although the moderators say that many subscribers have been kind and thoughtful to one another, the response from the community hasnt always been positive. After all, most of the subreddits active users are currently planning weddings, and are having to face difficult decisions over what is supposed to be a joyful occasion. Weddit as a community is going through a lot of emotions, and these emotions have changed over time as the situation has changed, says Maeve. Disbelief, sadness, and anger are three emotions we see a lot. Lots of anger. Sometimes this gets directed at the moderators. People upset or unclear about why their post was moved, upset about no megathread, upset about having a megathread, upset that were not explicitly saying you should postpone or cancel your wedding, upset that were allowing people to imply you should cancel your wedding, the whole gamut, Emilia says.
A particularly controversial topic, especially when official advice on social distancing and gatherings was unclear, was whether couples should go ahead with their weddings or cancel. In one instance, a user whose comment had been deleted wrote to the mods that, Blood is going to be on your hands if you continue to censor any dissent toward brides proudly refusing to cancel and in doing so, risking countless lives. But in that case, the mods explain, they had removed the post because its language did not meet the subreddits number one rule of constructive criticism and respectthe user had told the person who posted to get the fuck over themselves and fuck those bridezillas who think their wedding is worth people literally dying.
Even apparently anodyne posts can cause schisms. In the past couple of weeks, many Wedditors have been sharing pictures of the dresses they didnt get to wear in an attempt to lighten the mood and maintain a celebratory atmosphere. But dress pictures on r/weddingplanning have always been surprisingly divisive, with some users complaining that the subreddit is overwhelmed with dress posts and that the new wave of dress posts is just copycat spammers trying to reap karma.
Its been a tough time for the moderators, who didnt exactly expect to be sifting through posts about a pandemic when they took on the r/weddingplanning mantle. They all say that they are pleased to have the support of each other. Addy, who is also a moderator on some sport subreddits, says the vibe there is notably different: There, its been quieter and more about finding anything to fill the unexpected gap in content, which is a huge contrast from dealing with the (very understandable) stress and crises on r/weddingplanning. She says that r/weddingplanning is usually her moderator oasis compared to dealing with the rivalry, sexism and racism on the sport forums. Its so sad to now see r/weddingplanning as the more emotionally taxing place to moderate (although still extremely light on the bigotry, thankfully), she says."

The second is his enthusiasm for such devices. For more than a decade, Snyder, a biology researcher at Stanford University, has been using consumer wearables to determine whether these kinds of biosensorsand the data collected from themcan help track the onset of infections or illness.
Now Snyder and his team are launching a new research project. Its one that he hopes will eventually alert people that they might have viral illnesses, including Covid-19, up to two to three days before symptoms of the virus show up. The team of about a dozen researchers has just started soliciting participants for the study, after what Snyder described as a fast-tracked approval process through Stanfords Institutional Review Board. Theyre using software algorithms that have been trained on health patterns shared as part of a previous study, and theyre opening this new study up to data from different brands of consumer wearablesFitbit, Apple Watch, and more.
Its an ambitious study, one made all the more complicated by how rapidly this particular virus spreads, the myriad symptoms of the novel coronavirus, the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, the lack of available testing (which could make it challenging to confirm if and when the study participants have contracted Covid-19), and the inconsistencies in biometric tracking across different brands of wearable devices.
But Snyders group is not limiting the study to tracking just Covid-19, nor is it not alone in its efforts. Researchers at the University of California San Francisco have equipped health care workers with smart Oura rings, which track heart rate and nighttime respiratory rate, with the goal of building an algorithm that would help track Covid-19. And Scripps Research Translational Institute will be sucking in data from Fitbits, Apple Watches, and other wearables to help with real-time surveillance of contagious respiratory illnesses. In some cases, these disparate research teams might eventually merge data.
Wed like to impact the current pandemic by detecting Covid-19, but were also hoping this is a general detection tool, because even before Covid-19 that was the goal, says Snyder. In the next phase, maybe well be able to tell you, Your heart rate is up, maybe you dont want to go into work that day.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Snyder believes that heart rate is the physiological signal that will be most significant in this newly-launched study, which Fitbit has donated 1,000 activity trackers for. Based on previous studies, including one that focused on collecting heart rate and oxygen saturation levels during airline flights, Snyder says his team has been able to detect when people are fighting some kind of infection before theyre symptomatic because their baseline heart rates have gone up.
I know some people are focused on [tracking] skin temperature, and theres no question that has value, but wearables are sampling heart rate more frequently, he says. Even if a wrist wearable doesnt record a baseline heart rate or active heart rate with 100 percent accuracy, its the variation in measurementsthe delta, as Snyder puts itthat will be most telling.
Stanford hopes to attract thousands of participants who either have been wearing a smartwatch for awhile and can share past data, or who will start to wear one now and establish a baseline for heart rate. The study is device-agnostic; if its not a Fitbit, an Apple Watch or Garmin watch with heart rate sensors will work too. Based on all of this data, the goal is to build a new algorithm that could spot unusual patterns in heart rate data, possibly tipping people off to when their bodies have started to fight an infection.
Theyre not starting from scratch. That report Snyder published back in 2017, the one that showed a correlation between deviation patterns in physiological signals and the bodys inflammatory response, helped pave the way. Snyders team gathered 2 billion measurements from 60 people, all who were wearing consumer smartwatches. A postdoctoral scholar, Xiao Li, developed an algorithm for that study, called the change of heart algorithm. Snyders latest research will build off of this.
Scripps Research is doing something similar. In late March it put out a call for Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, or Amazfit wearers to download a Scripps-designed mobile app and join a new prospective study called Detect. The researchers say they plan to track participants heart rate, sleep, and overall activity patterns to try to detect the emergence of influenza, coronavirus, and other fast-spreading viral illnesses.
Again, its not the first time Scripps has launched this kind of study. But now theres an added urgency and increased interest on the funding side because of Covid-19. Earlier this year, Scripps, in collaboration with Fitbit, published the results of a two-year study on influenza tracking. The researchers analyzed Fitbit data from more than 47,000 users in five states, paying particular attention to increases in resting heart rate and abnormal sleep patterns; then compared that sensor data to weekly estimates of flu-like illnesses at the state level as reported by the CDC. The Fitbit data significantly improved flu-prediction models, the researchers concluded."

Ive researched seven centuries of pandemics. Yet ever since late January, I have been gobsmacked by the Covid-19 crisis. This surreal disbelief began with the news of China imposing a draconian quarantine on its peoplefirst in Wuhan, where the epidemic began, and then 14 neighboring cities, and then throughout the nation. It is, without doubt, the largest quarantine ever erected, and one that would be barely recognizable to the people who first created quarantine policies in the Middle Ages.
Howard Markel is the George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the author of Quarantine! and When Germs Travel.
Nonetheless, when comparing the ever-changing story of Covid-19 to pandemics past, I feel like quoting Yogi Berra: Its déjà vu all over again, albeit a nightmarish blend of several déjàs vu into one. In every epidemic, certain ideological, political, sociological, and economic chords are always struck, others only on occasion. With the coronavirus, technology and globalization are ensuring that nearly all epidemic chords are struck at once. Among them:
Epidemics are framed and shapedsometimes advanced and sometimes hinderedby how a given society understands a particular microbe to infect and spread to others.
People have always tried to avoid those deemed sick and contagious to others, long before we had a good understanding of the microbes that cause infectious diseases. The Old Testament as well as treatises by Thucydides, Hippocrates, and Galen all contain suggestions to avoid those afflicted with runny noses, coughs and sneezes, weird rashes, and many other symptoms. But because their understanding of the cause and spread of these diseases were so different (and scientifically untenable), their responses were feeble and ineffective.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
We forget that the scientific appreciation of microbial infections and their spread is a new phenomenon in the history of humankind. Not only was there swift identification of the causative coronavirus in question but, within hours of receiving its genome, scientists at the NIH were able to figure out which protein would make for the best vaccine product. Modern surveillance, public health measures, testing, and laboratory work all made for quick analysis and action.
The economic losses associated with epidemics can have a strong influence on public response.
The recent collapse of the Dow Jones Industrial Averages and virtually every other financial market last week is but one example of the losses nations, companies, and individuals incur during an epidemic or pandemic. The closure of seaports, airports, and other means of travel costs a fortune, as do closures of schools, factories, and other places of work. The 2003 SARS epidemic cost the world economy somewhere in the tens of billions, and we can expect a much larger loss this time with Covid-19. Moreover, todays global market and the connectivity of various stock markets and bond issues, in which massive sell-offs can be accomplished in seconds, amplify financial panics into losses that were unimaginable only a few decades ago.
From the political to the purely mercenary, secrecy and concealment has almost always contributed to the further spread of a pandemic and hindered public health management.
In 1892, Hamburg was the largest seaport in the world and sent off dozens of ships filled stem to stern with travelers, goods, cargo, and steerage immigrants. Struggling to contain a cholera pandemic that came Germanys way via Asia, India, and Eastern Europe, the politicians in control decided to conceal their problem and send off ships, business as usualonly to spread the disease further.
In 2003, China suppressed information regarding its SARS-coronavirus problem for nearly six months and only admitted to it after cases sprouted up in Hong Kong, Toronto, and elsewhereall to devastating effect.
With Covid-19, information and case reports were suppressed by President Xi Jinping and his autocratic government for over a month, thus giving the virus a running head start to global dominance. In todays global village, an outbreak anywhere has the potential to travel everywhere. In the 21st century, borders mean very little to microbes, and we need an international pandemic preparedness and containment collaborative with real powers, budgets, and action.
Widespread media coverage has been an essential aspect of any epidemic.
Even before the dawn of modern printing presses, journalists, scientists, scholars, and others have been writing about epidemics. Whats different today is that Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and a wide spectrum of sources has the ability to amplify and misdirect the flow of information, for better and for worse. The uninformed mass opinion that everybody is entitled to their own facts is a dangerous, if not deadly, way to interpret a pandemic."

So how'd it end up in the research literature?",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-is-nothing-like-the-spanish-flu/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e68175cac94e900085c0f5b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Ideas-spanishflu-613476154-2.jpg",2020-03-13T12:00:00Z,"Unfortunately, the two purported sources for the 2.5 percent fatality rate were published more than 40 years ago and their authors are no longer with us. I was able to reach public health expert Niall Johnson, however, primary author of a 2002 study that produced the oft-quoted estimate of 50 to 100 million deaths during the 1918 pandemic. He confirmed that the case fatality rate must be higher than is often given."" Historian John Barry, who wrote the comprehensive 2004 book The Great Influenza, agreed that 2.5 percent is much too low. The CFR was possibly around two percent in the U.S. and some other parts of the developed world, he said, but fatality rates were much higher elsewhere. Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Jennifer Leigh recently toldThe Los Angeles Times that the overall fatality rate for Spanish flu may have been closer to 10 percent.
We can calculate a range of plausible global fatality rates for the Spanish flu by varying the number of infections from 25 to 75 percent of the world population in 1918 and the number of deaths from 25 to 100 million. If we do so, we find that a reasonable estimate for the global case fatality rate of the Spanish flu is 6 to 8 percent. To be clear, this means that 6 to 8 percent of those who were infected died. Global mortality of the Spanish fluwhich is to say, the proportion of all people everywhere (infected and uninfected alike) who died from the diseasewas probably between two and four percent. A conflation of mortality across the world and fatality among the infected may partly explain some of the pervasive statistical confusion surrounding the Spanish flu.
Despite the mathematical impossibility of the Spanish flu killing at least 50 million with a 2.5 percent fatality rate, this phantom statistic has drifted far and wide, materializing everywhere from blogs, Twitter, and The New York Times to the most prestigious medical journals. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published somecommentaries repeating the incongruent figures. I contacted the journals editors and statistical consultants, pointing out the mistake and explaining what Id discovered about its possible origins. A few days later I got a reply from Jennifer Zeis, director of media and communications: ""Authors relied on different sources of information, which would yield discrepant values. There are published sources for each number, even if they are inconsistent.""
Of course estimates differ; the pandemic in question happened more than a century ago and we dont have anything close to complete or accurate records of its casualties. But that does not explain away a glaring mathematical incongruity, nor does it justify an abdication of scholarly responsibility. When errors slip past the safeguards of peer-reviewed research literature, they should be promptly corrected, especially when they have potential to breed misunderstanding and panic. Spanish flu has become synonymous with a viral apocalypse and, now, with the Covid-19 pandemic. This false equivalence depends largely on a spurious statistic that should never have been published. It is certainly possible, perhaps even inevitable, that a pandemic on the scale of the Spanish flu will happen again. But the latest estimates of Covid-19s fatality rate, infectiousness, and its response to public health measures indicate that in relative terms it will not match the devastation of 1918. The Spanish flus global mortality rate of 3 percent would translate to more than more than 230 million deaths today.
There are many additional reasons not to make blithe comparisons between the current crisis and the 1918 pandemic: stark differences in healthcare infrastructure and medical technology; the ravages of the first World War; the unusual tendency of the Spanish flu to kill young adults; and the fact that many, if not most, people infected with influenza in 1918 died from secondary bacterial infections (as mass-produced antibiotics did not yet exist). The global fatality rate is just an average and the CFR of any pandemic varies immensely by age, population, and geography. During the Spanish flu, for instance, it ranged from less than one percent in some areas to 90 percent in one Alaskan village. What gets lost in superficial analogies is that, despite some valid and instructive parallels between the two pandemics, there are many more differences. We cant use half-contrived statistics about a century-old pandemic to predict what will happen today.
When WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Mar. 3 that the novel coronavirus had a global case fatality rate of 3.4 percent, he was simply reporting known deaths divided by known cases, not an intelligent estimate or a definitive number. Infectious disease mathematician Adam Kucharski and his colleagues recently calculated that the true case fatality rate in China is between 0.3 and 2.4 percent; other researchers have concluded that the global CFR is likely similar. These estimates will continue to change with time and increased testing. Some experts anticipate that, if widespread testing were deployed, the global fatality rate would remain at or below two percent. Theres also a possibility, however, that the final global fatality rate will be higher than current data indicate. Near the start of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, CFR estimates were 10 times too large. During the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, however, early CFR estimates were nearly three times too small."

This is what science can tell us so far.",https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-immunity/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e98beddd036ef00088bfc29/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_antobodies_6b35cff987_o.jpg",2020-04-17T20:43:49Z,"One of the many unknowns about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is how we might become immune to it. When you get infected with viruses, along with other baddies like bacteria, your immune system fights back by producing proteins called antibodies. These stick around for the long haul, and your body is prepared to churn out more of them if you come into contact with the pathogen again. 
It's how vaccines work: By introducing a dead or weakened version of a virus to your immune system, you trick it into producing antibodies in response. Then if you come into contact with the real virus, your body will be ready.
Viruses vary widely in terms of the immune response they elicit. For instance, if you got chicken pox as a kid, you are likely to be immune to reinfection for the rest of your life. With whooping cough, immunity might last for up to 20 years, and for the H1N1 flu strain, up to 10. With the seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold, immunity fades after a few months, which is why you can pick up new infections year after year.
But when it comes to SARS-CoV-2, because this is such a new infection, were not sure how long those antibodies hang around for, says Dr. Seema Yasmin, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative.
Our best bet may be to compare it to the original SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV. In patients infected with this virus, antibody levels peaked between two and four months after infection and offered protection for two to three years. I think the glimmer of hope might be that theres so much genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, adds Yasmin.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Speaking of genetics, another virus to consider as a comparison is HIV. This virus is so difficult to treat because it mutates like mad as it multiplies. The human body might develop an antibody, but it's one that will become less effective as the virus changes. Some good news on the coronavirus front is this virus does not seem to mutate anywhere near as frequently as HIV mutates, says Yasmin. That means it stays much more consistent, and it means we have far less of a moving target.
Discovering more about how immunity to this new coronavirus works will be key to fighting the pandemic. The more people who become immuneeither from beating an infection or from receiving a vaccinethe closer we get to herd immunity, or the point at which most members of the population have antibodies. Then well start to slow and eventually stop the pandemic.

TechCrunch surveyed Chicago venture capitalists who remain optimistic despite the current crisis. COVID-19 could be good for Chicago, they told TechCrunch throughout their survey responses.
It’s clear from the responses below investors in Chicago are interested in startups in and out of the city. As explained in the responses, the partners and associates are happy to invest in worthwhile companies no matter where the company is located. That said, they see Chicago as a fantastic place to experience big city life with a much lower cost of living than what’s available in NYC, San Francisco or Seattle.
Here’s who we surveyed:
<ul><li>Guy Turner, partner, Hyde Park Venture Partners</li><li>Constance Freedman, founder and managing partner, Moderne Ventures</li><li>Katie McClain, partner, Energize Ventures</li><li>Bess Goodfellow, principal, Hyde Park Angels</li><li>Rachel Stillman, associate, 7WireVentures</li></ul>VCs are optimistic that COVID-19 will result in a win for Chicago
Guy Turner sees a possible outcome where Chicago and other cities in the region benefit from the COVID-19 fallout. He said, “In this sense, COVID could reaccelerate Chicago and other midcontinent cities’ startup communities with more availability of talent and cheaper operating costs. Might COVID result in tech flight to ex-urban or suburban communities around the midcontinent, or otherwise in third- and fourth-tier cities around the country?” He later notes this warning: “Related to the 2020 COVID recession, I would expect the availability of local capital for seed and post-seed stage financing to reduce somewhat.”
Constance Freedman of Moderne Ventures notes on COVID-19: “I think Chicago is poised to come out well. The city is affordable to begin with like 50% more affordable than the West or East Coast hubs Chicago has long been known for banking, real estate, health care and insurance. I think these sectors and others are poised to do well. The largest opportunity for us (and any major city) is how to close the education gap, which leads to closing the income gap and from there the sky is the limit!”
Rachel Stillman of 7WireVentures is optimistic, too, in part saying, “We believe that Chicago will remain a technology hub and may actually stand to benefit from the shift to more remote work. As talent recruitment becomes democratized through location-agnostic roles, many of the functions that have been characterized by scarce talent pools (e.g., engineering, data science, product) will benefit from national recruitment capabilities. Additionally, strong candidates that prefer to remain in the Midwest were historically pushed to move to the coasts for career advancement.
Chicago VCs to continue regional and national focus
Nearly all the investors surveyed stressed their firms focus is not on just Chicago, but startups nationwide. None expect COVID-19 to change that mission.
Katie McClain of Energize Ventures said, “We expect to maintain a balance of investing in companies across geographies that are not limited to Silicon Valley. With many more firms going remote and relocating to areas outside of the West Coast since the start of the pandemic, we see a big opportunity for non-Bay Area companies to emerge. Were excited about what that could mean for cities like Chicago and the Midwest in general.”
Guy Turner sees a similar outcome, noting, “We expect to maintain the same geographic focus after COVID, however, we are likely to be more open to teams and companies with a remote or partially remote working structure. In the past, we mostly avoided ‘virtual’ teams, but the last six months have proven at scale that companies can be innovative and productive with a largely remote culture.”
Guy Turner, partner at Hyde Park Venture Partners
How much is local investing a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
We are geographically focused on the “midcontinent” in which we include the Midwest, Toronto and Atlanta. We are indeed investing remotely right now, but are maintaining our geographic lens so that we sustain a focused sourcing, talent and co-investing network post-COVID. Early-stage investing is a very personal and network-driven business, so we want to be near and accessible to find and work with the best founders. Focusing on specific geographies has allowed us to do this and will again after COVID. Chicago represents about 40% of our activity historically and will likely continue to.
Long term, do you expect to be more or less locally focused?
We expect to maintain the same geographic focus after COVID, however, we are likely to be more open to teams and companies with a remote or partially remote working structure. In the past, we mostly avoided “virtual” teams, but the last six months have proven at scale that companies can be innovative and productive with a largely remote culture. Most “virtual” companies still have an HQ with several key leaders, and we seek companies that call a city in our geography HQ. The best way we’ve found to filter for the center of mass of a remote or virtually run company is to ask the question, “Where do you hold your holiday party or off-sites?” This usually coincides with the city where one or more founders live.
What do you expect to happen to the startup climate in Chicago longer term, with the shift to more remote work, possibly from more remote areas. Will it stay a tech hub? (Will there be tech hubs? What is a tech hub now?)
We remain optimistic that the decade of progress in Chicago’s march toward “tech hub” status will not be interrupted by COVID. Indeed, it was the higher unemployment and dropping rents of the financial crisis that helped spark the growth of the Chicago startup community, in what is otherwise a fairly traditional and conservative business community. One of the first companies we invested in paid $12/square foot/month in the Chicago Merchandise Mart in 2012. Depending how you count, that space reached $40 to $60/square foot in the 2019 peak.
In this sense, COVID could reaccelerate Chicago and other midcontinent cities’ startup communities with more availability of talent and cheaper operating costs. Might COVID result in tech flight to ex-urban or suburban communities around the midcontinent, or otherwise in third- and fourth-tier cities around the country? The new virtual work trend may enable more of that at the margin, but it’s hard to see it taking off at scale. In the long run, startups will still have to fly to sell their products or have employees fly in for HQ events post-COVID. That means most startups will want to have some center near a top 10 or top 20 airport. Young people (founders, tech talent, etc.) still want to date, experience nightlife and have fun with lots of other young people i.e., city life.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
Chicago has always been a logistics hub and is now becoming a logistics tech hub with companies like FourKites, Shipbob and Forager. COVID highlighted the fragility and importance of our food supply chains, making the role and potential of these companies increasingly visible. This will be good for Chicago and the broader Midwest.
In the short term, what challenges are facing Chicagos startup scene?
Related to the 2020 COVID recession, I would expect the availability of local capital for seed and post-seed stage financing to reduce somewhat. While we were fortunate to raise our third fund late last year, some of our peer funds were still raising or planning to raise their next fund. A few are likely to come out smaller or to be significantly delayed in their next raise given the effects of COVID on most venture portfolios’ valuations and exit horizons. This means seed and post-seed rounds will probably be harder for local startups to raise for a few years. On the other hand, angel activity remains very strong given the rebound of public markets, and coastal funds continue to show strong interest and deployment in Series A and later in Chicago.
Likewise as in every other geography COVID has significantly slowed down the growth of most startups while aiding a small few. Chicago is no exception, though there are some restaurant tech startups (Tock, Chowly, etc.) and logistics startups (FourKites, Shipbob, Forager) that have come out on top. This is my mental model for what the startup opportunity set looks like during COVID versus normal times but just as true anywhere else as here:

Less related to COVID, Chicago has always been strong in sales talent but weaker on product and product-led growth talent. This is improving with each successive generation of successful startup outcomes like Grubhub, Cleversafe, Braintree, GoHealth, etc. But it’s a long journey.
Who are some founders (who youve invested in or otherwise) that are leaders in the community?
<ul><li>Garry Cooper at Rheaply: Series A stage and has been very involved in social justice efforts locally.</li><li>Amanda Lannert at Jellyvision: late stage and very active angel.</li><li>Mike Evans at Fixer: co-founder of Grubhub and now runs a startup B-corp.</li></ul>A lot of Bay Area founders and developers are looking to relocate. Why Chicago or even the Midwest?
The answer is pretty simple. The cost of living in Chicago in particular housing is about half or less that of the Bay Area/SF and NYC. If you go to a Minneapolis, Indianapolis or Cincinnati, you’re talking a quarter or a third. If you are starting a startup or a career in tech, that is a massively different paradigm under which to build a nest egg. You just can’t in most major coastal cities. Chicago is also a beautiful place with all the benefits of a top three U.S. city culture, arts, career opportunities, education, accepting culture, etc.
Constance Freedman, founder and managing partner at Moderne Ventures
I think as a society we do not quite know how COVID is going to impact us all long term but what is becoming clear is that we are going to need to all figure out how to live with COVID for the foreseeable future, which could be many more months or, more likely, years.
What does that mean for the startup scene in Chicago? First, what does it mean for cities broadly? There will be a repositioning of sorts as workplaces everywhere evaluate what “work from home means” and where, when and how we go back to the office.
We are social people and we need social interaction so there will be a return of some kind how and when is unclear.
Where do people want to live? Data is showing us that migration to the suburbs and second home markets are up all those millennials who would never buy a home and move to the suburbs are buying homes and moving to the suburbs (or moving back in with their parents as the case may be); moves into the expensive first-tier cities are down. People who say, Why am I living in a 300 square foot apartment with four roommates in NYC [or SF or insert equally crazy expensive city here] when I cant even enjoy the city I am in? are asking the right question. COVID has provided an opportunity for those who are still employed to reassess their quality of life and make changes.
I think this has big impact on the most expensive cities in the world and less impact on the secondary and tertiary markets. Short term, there is not much change but long term, as the Silicon Valley startups expand work-from-home, headquarters may also move.
World-class startups still need world-class feeders, so I dont expect expansion to reach all that far, but perhaps density or proximity to work becomes less important for those who work there. This may give more cities a change to rise, including Chicago.
So what does this mean for Chicago startup ecosystem? I think Chicago is poised to come out well. The city is affordable to begin with like 50% more affordable than the West or East Coast hubs. If I live in Chicago I can afford space, I can enjoy my city and I have good transportation if I want to bail out of the city and move to the suburbs. Chicago has a strong ecosystem of universities and capital that can sustain it and may become more appealing to those (tech people and investors) who moved out to go to the coasts in the first place and now realize they dont need to be there. As people migrate to live where they really want to live, with the lifestyle they want to have, near family they want to be with, they begin to look for more local opportunities and that may bring some great talent back to Chicago and other markets outside of the coasts.
Chicago has long been known for banking, real estate, health care and insurance. I think these sectors and others are poised to do well. The largest opportunity for us (and any major city) is how to close the education gap, which leads to closing the income gap and from there the sky is the limit!
Katie McClain, partner at Energize Ventures
How much is local investing a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
When we look at investments, we focus on diversifying our portfolio and that includes diversity across geographies. While we dont necessarily have a filter for local founders, we are intentional about making sure about half of our investments are in companies outside of the Bay Area. Our portfolio includes startups based in Chicago, Austin, Boston, New Jersey and Switzerland, just to name a few. For us, its important to be closer to the customer and we love it when we can find them close to our hometown. Weve actually just recently invested in a Chicago-based company that were very excited to announce soon, so stay tuned!
Long term, do you expect to be more or less locally focused?
We expect to maintain a balance of investing in companies across geographies that are not limited to Silicon Valley. With many more firms going remote and relocating to areas outside of the West Coast since the start of the pandemic, we see a big opportunity for non-Bay Area companies to emerge. Were excited about what that could mean for cities like Chicago and the Midwest in general.
From that, what do you expect to happen to the startup climate in Chicago longer term, with the shift to more remote work, possibly from more remote areas. Will it stay a tech hub? (Will there be tech hubs? What is a tech hub now?)
We believe the shift away from traditional tech hubs like New York, Boston and San Francisco presents a great opportunity for Chicago as people are discovering they can be efficient, innovative and collaborative in other pockets of the world. This could play out positively for our city in a number of ways, from creating jobs to enabling new opportunities for investors to back Chicago-based companies. Its important to note that we believe certain sectors with centers of gravity in Chicago like energy, industrials and manufacturing are here to stay. However, how far that reach might extend beyond the Loop and into the broader ecosystem is still a work in progress.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
There are several industries that have a particularly strong presence in Chicago namely finance, renewable energy, manufacturing and industry (its no coincidence that Energize plays in a bit of each of these arenas!). On the finance side, I think it is easier for that sector to transition to a more remote, distributed environment. For more asset-based industries like energy, manufacturing and commodities, we see this as more of a challenge. However, the highly distributed nature of our new world is accelerating adoption of digital technologies in these sectors, and this is what were most excited about!
For example, a company like Beekeeper, which provides a digital communication and collaboration tool for frontline workers, presents a compelling value proposition for energy and industrial businesses in Chicago that have had to entirely alter on-the-ground operations due to COVID-19. Another example of this is a drone software provider: DroneDeploy has seen five times as many flights among its energy customers this year given the spike in demand for remote services. There is a strong presence of essential industries in Chicago that we believe are here to stay, but how they operate will be different and that is where technologies like these can play an important role in shaping the future of work and driving innovation.
In the short term, what challenges are facing Chicagos startup scene?
Not having as strong of a reputation for its startup scene as cities on the coasts, Chicago can sometimes be overlooked by big-name investors who tend to stay local. In addition, now that many coastal VCs are retrenching, early-stage Chicago companies that would typically rely on them will need to find other sources of capital to fill the gap. That said, its more important than ever to raise awareness about rich and diverse startup ecosystem weve developed here.
Who are some founders (who youve invested in or otherwise) that are leaders in the community?
We havent invested of any of these founders, but if you would like intros we could possibly arrange: Jennifer Holmgren (LanzaTech), Matt Silver (Forager), Michael Polsky, the leading local energy entrepreneur who founded Invenergy (our anchor investor) and chairs Energizes investment committee.
A lot of Bay Area founders and developers are looking to relocate. Why Chicago?
Chicago offers access to a high-quality, diverse pool of corporates and potential customers, particularly in industries like energy, critical infrastructure and manufacturing that are beginning to adopt emerging technologies at an accelerated pace. You also cant beat those Midwestern values stereotypes aside, were proud to be among neighbors who bring a grounded, get-it-done mentality! We believe Chicago is the perfect nexus of talent, grit and opportunity upheld by a committed community of investors and operators.
Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?
Energize is very bullish about the digital transformation we see happening right now. Companies in established industries are adopting technologies faster than ever before, and thats not constrained to the West Coast. The core of our thesis is accelerating digital innovation in energy and heavy industry, and were seeing that play out across the globe. Innovation at scale is happening right here in Chicago, and were excited to be a part of that ecosystem. Lastly: If youre building a company that provides software or business model innovation to help propel this exciting transformation, wed love to hear from you!
Bess Goodfellow, principle at Hyde Park Angels
How much is local investing a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
HPA focuses on the Midwest, so the pandemic hasnt altered that focus; however, we certainly have engaged remotely with entrepreneurs more than before. We’ve completed 13 new deals this year already. Three deals were announced the past few weeks (Chowbus, Cohesion and Dispatch) and another new deal will be announced next week.
Long term, do you expect to be more or less locally focused?
The same.
What do you expect to happen to the startup climate in Chicago longer term, with the shift to more remote work, possibly from more remote areas. Will it stay a tech hub?
Absolutely. The macro trends are favoring many of the tech companies helping to accelerate growth, which is essential for the health of the tech community. We are optimistic that the companies that are hitting headwinds will be supported by those growing rapidly. Thankfully, we are seeing that already in our portfolio.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
Digital health, direct-to-consumer and e-commerce are doing really well in Chicago.
Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?
We’ve seen recent success with Sprout Social and GoHealth going public. Other Chicago-affiliated companies like Tempus, Livongo and FourKites are emerging as clear industry leaders in their respective categories. We expect to see more of our portfolio and those throughout Chicago continue to do what hardworking Chicagoans do, and fight through this pandemic to emerge even stronger!
Rachel Stillman, associate at 7WireVentures
How much is local investing a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?
We have been and remain supporters of the Chicago community and continuously advise and meet with entrepreneurs in this ecosystem. With that said, we continue to have a national geographic focus as we are interested in growing great founders and teams first and foremost.
Long term, do you expect to be more or less locally focused?
Our focus long term with regard to local investments will remain the same, and we will continue to be actively engaged and supportive of the Chicago early-stage health care and technology ecosystem. We acknowledge that travel restrictions and adherence to social distancing guidelines may inhibit our ability to conduct onsite visits with founders outside of our local market, but we will continue to be creative about conducting remote diligence of management teams.
From that, what do you expect to happen to the startup climate in Chicago longer term, with the shift to more remote work, possibly from more remote areas. Will it stay a tech hub? (Will there be tech hubs? What is a tech hub now?)
We believe that Chicago will remain a technology hub and may actually stand to benefit from the shift to more remote work. As talent recruitment becomes democratized through location-agnostic roles, many of the functions that have been characterized by scarce talent pools (e.g., engineering, data science, product) will benefit from national recruitment capabilities. Additionally, strong candidates that prefer to remain in the Midwest were historically pushed to move to the coasts for career advancement. Decentralized (and remote) work will now allow for more investment in Chicago talent, both in recruitment efforts and capital investments. Chicago will continue to have strong universities and innovation ecosystem drivers 1871, Matter Health, the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship that will produce and attract exciting technology companies. Entrepreneurs will still seek a sense of community and a place to ideate and engage with like-minded creators, and Chicago will continue to fulfill that need within the technology ecosystem.
Are there particular industry sectors that you expect to do uniquely well or poorly, locally?
We have seen a rise in the quantity and growth of companies across digital health and health care IT. Exits and liquidity events of successful digital health companies such as Livongo will drive a new wave and generation of technology founders equipped with capital and domain expertise. Ecosystem aggregators and incubators such as Matter Health will continue to support early growth from ideation to creation of healthcare solutions. Therefore, we remain bullish on the local healthcare ecosystem and believe it has yet to reach its full potential.
In the short term, what challenges are facing Chicagos startup scene?
Historically, Chicago has received a lower amount of venture capital dollars relative to competing major metropolitan cities. With less initial funding, founders in Chicago may focus more on pragmatically growing companies with financially sound strategies (versus the growth at all cost mentality of the coasts). Additionally, less capital makes it harder to recruit talent in some cases, as companies located in coastal cities may have the financial resources to offer very attractive packages, particularly to technologists, who then will leave the Chicago market. Given the workforce changes driven by COVID-19, we have started to see a shift in companies’ willingness to recruit from remotely located talent pools. Companies located in coastal markets with deeper capital pools will be able to afford to pay a higher premium for quality talent in Chicago, enabling these top talent recruits to remain in the city. Over the past two years, Chicago has attracted an increased amount of venture dollars and incited the development of new venture firms and additional funds, with venture capital deployed to Chicago companies exceeding $2 billion in 2019. With Chicago reported to be one of the strongest cities for venture capital returns, we believe that firms seeking opportunities to maximize ROI will continue to invest in Chicago and further fuel the growth we’ve observed in the city.
Who are some founders (who youve invested in or otherwise) that are leaders in the community?
There are several prominent founders across the Chicago startup community; we have highlighted two across our portfolio but note that these alone certainly do not capture the full market of founders across this highly impressive ecosystem.
Across 7wireVentures investments, Stephen Smith, founder and CEO of NOCD, is a leader we are incredibly proud to have within our portfolio. Faced with the challenges of receiving appropriate obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment himself, Stephen was inspired to found NOCD, a specialty telehealth platform that identifies and manages people with OCD by delivering personalized therapy. In addition to servicing people with NOCD, the company has scaled to create high-profile local jobs in the Chicago market and the Midwest.
Additionally, we are incredibly proud of two of our co-founders, Dave Jacobs and David Greenberg, who built and scaled Homethrive alongside our team through the 7wireVentures hatch model. Homethrive is a tech-enabled platform supporting aging-in place by providing seniors and their caregivers personalized insight, advice and validated resources for key nonclinical services. The company has created over 40+ jobs in Chicago and supported hundreds of family caregivers across Chicago, the Midwest, and the country. The “Dave’s” (as they are referred to at 7wire) have been pivotal in the ideation, development and successful growth of the company.
I would also be remiss not to mention my long-time business partner, Glen Tullman, executive chairman and founder of Livongo. Despite the success we have had over the years exiting multiple companies, Glen and I both have committed to remain in Chicago, a city and technology ecosystem we both believe in. Glen has committed his career to improving the safety, empathy and efficiency of the U.S. health care system. His vision and efforts to bring together health and technology were pivotal in scaling Livongo to what is now a $13 billion+ company and as a result, created hundreds of jobs across the Chicago health care and technology ecosystem.
A lot of Bay Area founders and developers are looking to relocate. Why Chicago?
While other major cities may offer a concentrated hub of technology experts, Chicago uniquely embodies the culture of strong “Midwestern work ethics.” The city attracts and grows talent pools influenced by Midwestern values and humility, with an unwavering willingness to work thoughtfully. As a result, the Chicago technology community is tightknit but still welcoming to outsiders, and deeply values collaboration and shared ideation. For founders and developers looking to relocate, Chicago offers a community of bright-minded individuals at a cost of living discount relative to its large metropolitan city companions.
In addition to the strong culture, Chicago offers a unique talent pool characterized by a combination of corporate-bred individuals bringing institutional knowledge, and a growing pipeline of employees raised in startups. Illinois is home to 66 of the Fortune 500 companies (the number four state in the U.S.), while a new wave of successful Chicago-based technology companies have complemented the candidate pool with technology talent from the likes of Salesforce, Groupon, Livongo, Grubhub and Braintree.
Finally, founders located in Chicago stand to benefit from the proximity and local access to their target customers, many of which are not residing in the coastal cities but here in the Midwest. In the early stages of building a company, it is fundamental to intimately understand and know the problems of your customer. There is no better strategy to learn and share the values of your target clients than to live among them in the Midwest."

The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will evaluate new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients with COVID-19 in the immediate term, and other viral pathogens in the future, according to a statement from the Gates Foundation.
As part of the initiative, the three partners committed to “equitable access, including making products available and affordable in low-resource settings.”
That’s an issue right now as healthcare systems struggle with access to testing kits and potentially high-cost therapeutics developed by private industry. The government agencies tasked with responding to the outbreak apparently lack the resources to engage in such an initiative and are relying on the private sector to help.
The immediate goal for the new accelerator is to catalyze the evaluation and development of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients with COVID-19. 
Right now, there aren’t any broad-spectrum antivirals or immunotherapies available to combat the spread of emerging pathogens — and certainly none approved for use on COVID-19, according to the Gates Foundation statement.
Gates and Wellcome, a non-profit foundation, are each contributing up to $50 million to the accelerator, with the Gates Foundation money pulled from its $100 million commitment to finance a COVID-19 response made in February.
Viruses like COVID-19 spread rapidly, but the development of vaccines and treatments to stop them moves slowly, said Mark Suzman, chief executive officer of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, in a statement. If we want to make the world safe from outbreaks like COVID-19, particularly for those most vulnerable, then we need to find a way to make research and development move faster. That requires governments, private enterprise, and philanthropic organizations to act quickly to fund R&amp;D.
The new accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, government and private sector funders and other organizations along with regulators and policy-setting institutions, according to a statement, and will focus on everything from drug pipeline development through manufacturing and expanding production and distribution.
For the Gates Foundation, the cross-disciplinary approach was one of the lessons learned from its approach to containing the Ebola outbreak in 2014.
According to a statement from the foundation, the accelerator will operate as a joint initiative of the funders and will pursue a three different strategies. It will identify compounds and potential novel therapies, work with industry partners, and coordinate with regulators to get treatments into market.
This virus is an unprecedented global threat, and one for which we must propel international partnerships to develop treatments, rapid diagnostics, and vaccines. Science is moving at a phenomenal pace against COVID-19, but to get ahead of this epidemic we need greater investment and to ensure research co-ordination,” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, in a statement. “The Therapeutics Accelerator will allow us to do this for potential treatments with support for research, development, assessment, and manufacturing. COVID-19 is an extremely challenging virus, but weve proved that through collaborating across borders we can tackle emerging infectious diseases."

Here’s your Daily Crunch for March 16, 2020.
1. Alphabets Verily launches its California COVID-19 test screening site in a limited pilot
Alphabet-owned health technology company Verily has launched the COVID-19 screening site that was first described by President Trump as a broadly focused coronavirus web-based screening and testing utility developed by Google.
After a flurry of blog posts by Google and Verily over the weekend as well as Trump’s subsequent claim that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to apologize it became clear that the screening and testing site was a Verily project, limited in scope to California residents, with a specific focus on a couple of counties for now.
2. Stock markets halted for unprecedented third time due to coronavirus scare
The morning after the Federal Reserve cut its interest rates to near zero at the urging of the president, all of the indexes posted major losses. For the third time in the past two weeks, the Dow hit its emergency circuit breaker as the market opened; the S&amp;P also halted trades.
3. Microsoft Teams goes down just as everyone starts working from home
The technology giant left a cryptic message on Twitter, stating that it has received reports that impact associated with TM206544 is ongoing. Perfect timing.
4. The latest Powerbeats bring Pro-style updates to a tethered design at $149
After several weeks’ worth of leaks, the latest version of Apple/Beats Powerbeats arrives this week. But there will be no Powerbeats 4 not for now, at least. Instead, the companys somewhat confusingly doing away with the numbering scheme in favor of the simpler Powerbeats name.

It was the evening of October 12, 1768, and Dimsdale was preparing the empress of Russia, Catherine the Great, for her procedure. From a technical perspective, what he planned was simple, medically sound, and minimally invasive. It required only two or three small slices into Catherines arm. Nevertheless, Dimsdale had good reason for his concern, because into those slices he would grind a few scabby pustules teeming with variolathe virus responsible for smallpox and the death of nearly a third of those who contracted it. Though he infected Catherine at her behest, Dimsdale was so concerned about the outcome that he secretly arranged for a stagecoach to rush him out of St. Petersburg should his procedure go awry.
What Dimsdale planned is alternatively called a variolation or inoculation, and while it was dangerous it nevertheless represented the pinnacle of medical achievement at the time. In a variolation, a doctor transferred smallpox pustules from a sick patient into a healthy one becausefor reasons no one at the time understooda variolated patient typically developed only a mild case of smallpox while still gaining lifelong immunity.
Twenty-eight years later, Edward Jenner improved this proto-vaccination when he discovered he could use a safer, sister virus of variola called cowpox to inoculate his patients. But its the original variolationnot Jenners vaccinethat first established the efficacy of the crazy, and at the time ludicrously dangerous idea upon which nearly all vaccines rely: The intentional infection of a healthy person with a weakened pathogen to bequeath immunity.
Modern immunologists have advanced this life-saving concept to such a degree that if they find a vaccine for Covid-19, it will pose no risk of widespread infection. Inoculums today induce the production of antibodies while being incapable of large-scale reproduction. But that wasnt the case when they were first discovered. When Dimsdale variolated Catherine, his process merely gave her immune system the upper hand. He knew she would sicken.
By now we are so familiar with the life-saving concept behind vaccines that its easy to forget how insane, genius, and unethical these first inoculations must have been. Even Dimsdale, who had performed the procedure thousands of times, was clearly skeptical he could talk his way out of a noose should Catherines variolation end poorly.
And yet the idea to intentionally infect a patient with a lethal virus to help them did first occur to someoneand it was perhaps the greatest idea in the history of medicine.
It was not Jenners idea, nor was it Dimsdales. But it may have been a single persons. Remarkably, variolation may not have been independently discovered. Instead, the earliest documentation suggests it began in Chinaprobably in the southwestern provinces of either Anhui or Jiangxibefore spreading across the globe in a cascading series of introductions.
Chinese sea merchants introduced the procedure to Africa, brought knowledge of it overland to India, and carried it along the Silk Road to Turkey, which is where 18th century European ambassadors finally learned of the technique and brought it home. The timing and paths of variolations introductions around the world suggests the idea spread out of one place, at one time. Perhaps from one person.
According to one legend, recounted in Yü Thien-chhihs Collected commentaries on smallpox written in 1727, the first inoculator was an eccentric and extraordinary man who had himself derived it from the alchemical adepts.
Who was this eccentric and extraordinary man who invented immunology with one of the greatest ideas and boldest experiments in medical history?
His or her name is not only long lost, but it was probably never written. However, legends and ancient Chinese medical treatises make it possible to construct a plausible biography for someone who Ill simply call the extraordinary man, after Thien-chhihs legend, or X for short."

Keeping the lights on was no easy task.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-google-meet-weathered-work-from-home-explosion/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f31df6e25cd361f9f68895f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Gear-Google-Meet-Growth-1192090100.jpg",2020-08-11T19:24:08Z,"Samantha Schaevitz was in the home stretch of a fellowship at Huridocs, a human rights nonprofit, when she got the call. Schaevitz works on site reliability engineering at Google; theyre the ones who keep steady the ship when things get choppy. And by February of this year, as large portions of Asia shut down in an attempt to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, Google Meet found itself taking on water. They needed Schaevitz back at work.
Google launched Meet in 2017, as an enterprise-focused alternative to its Hangouts chat service. (Google has been steadily phasing out Hangouts and pushing users to Meet and Chat, part of its forever-muddled messaging platform strategy.) As the coronavirus spread and more countries issued stay-at-home orders, people flocked to video chat services for work and to check in on family and friends. Google saw Meet undergo 30-times growth in the early months of the pandemic; soon enough, the service was hosting up to 100 million meeting participants each day. That's a lot.
Amid all the profound changes people have made in response to Covid-19, the infrastructure that undergirds the internet experienced a shift in usage patterns, too, as people traded office hours for home isolation. The companies that handle these systems have mostly been able to manage users' new needs. You essentially took the peak and extended it over a far longer period of the day, says Ben Treynor Sloss, Google vice president of engineering. The usage went way up, but it was mostly that the use looked more like peak most of the day, rather than that the peaks went up dramatically. Some services, though, saw usage spike well beyond normal.
Google prepares for emergencies on a regular basis through its disaster and incident response tests, or DIRT. In these exercises, around 10,000 employees at a time will simulate handling some sort of crisis, ranging from a localized natural disaster to a Godzilla attack. The Covid-19 pandemic, though, turned out to exceed even the companys most dramatic scenarios.
We had typically simulated a regional-level event, says Treynor Sloss. Wed never done DIRT for a global-level event, in part, if Im being honest, because it didnt seem likely. There was also a practical concern: Convincingly mocking up an incident with worldwide impact risks downgrading the experiences of actual Google users, a cardinal sin in the world of DIRT.
All of which meant that Schaevitz, who led the incident response for Google Meet, and the teams involved had to figure things out on the fly. Especially as it became clear that they were taking on far more new users than their most ambitious early projections.
In the beginning, we started planning for a doubling of our footprint, which is already huge. Thats not the normal growth curve. We soon realized that wasnt going to be enough, says Schaevitz. We kept trying to make progress on building more runway so that we would have time to figure out a solution if things would arise on a longer time horizon rather than just every day waking up and being like, whats newly on fire today?
Complicating the challenge was that the Google engineers involved in the response were themselves working from home, spread across four offices in three different countries. All the people who worked on this, and this is a large number of teams, even the people working on it in the same place have actually never been in the room together since this started, says Schaevitz, who is based in Zurich, Switzerland. On a technical level that proved manageable enough; as you might imagine, Google prioritizes web-based tools that can be accessed from anywhere. But coordinating the 24-hour-a-day operation remotely required setting up redundancies for more than just bandwidth; in a blog post detailing the response, Schaevitz describes how everyone in an incident response role was assigned a standby, basically an understudy who could step in if the principal got sick or had to take time away. (An especially prudent measure during a global health crisis.)"

Bring Back Blogs,"To ensure readers get the latest, best information on Covid-19, pandemic experts need to go back to the early days of Web 2.0.",https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-expert-twitter-only-goes-so-far-bring-back-blogs/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e9a429db1d67d0009c2cdf9/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/feature-pandemic_blogosphere.jpg",2020-04-23T15:00:00Z,"Late last monthI did an interview with GQ about technology and the coronavirus pandemic. This is a little bit flippant, I told the reporter, but in terms of closing things down for public health, one of the big boosts they could make would probably be shutting down Twitter. I dont fully believe this anymore. Though Twitter is still overrun with toxic anger and fear-based nonsense (now more than ever), it is also, in one crucial way, beginning to play an important role in our response to the pandemic. But it needs help.
Lets start with whats going right: So-called Expert Twitter seems to be rising to the occasion. Pandemics are immensely complicated, and understanding them requires knowledge from obscure technical fields, like epidemiology, genetics, virology, and immunology. Identifying smart ideas and leading experts in these niche sub-disciplines is a daunting objective. Twitter is helping.
Cal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University and the author of Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World (2019).
The platforms commercial success is built on its eerily effective ability to filter through the avalanche of content generated by its 330 million users to find those gems that prove irresistible. It accomplishes this in a manner thats largely agnostic to what the tweets actually say. The services timeline algorithm takes into account your relationship to the tweets authornot just whether you follow them, but also how often you like or retweet themas well as the engagement the particular tweet has been generating from others. It combines these metrics to find tweets that fall into that perfect intersection of your affinities and sticky communication. In normal times, this algorithm serves to make Twitter almost destructively addictive. During the pandemic, however, when our affinities have turned toward a desperate craving for useful information, the dynamics of this algorithm now serve a crucial purpose: helping to surface otherwise hard to find niche experts.
Its how, for example, so many now know about Trevor Bedford (@trvrb), a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, whos using computational algorithms to understand how the virus is spreading. Or Cameron Kyle-Sidell (@cameronks), an emergency room doctor in New York City whos been leading the call for drastic changes to standard intubation protocols. Or, Hendrick Streeck (@hendrikstreeck), the Director of the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn, whose pioneering field studies of a German coronavirus hotspot are radically changing our understanding of how the virus spreads (hint: youre not likely to get it from the jogger passing you on the sidewalk).
We can use Twitters follower count metric to quantify the astounding rate at which these previously unknown experts have exploded into prominence. In mid-February, after Trevor Bedford first began tweeting extensively about Covid-19 related genomic tracking, he had 10,000 followers. By mid-April this number had grown to 211,000, giving him roughly the same audience as longtime New York Times columnist David Brooks.
This distributed expertise triage is not just useful but also a relatively new capability. If this pandemic had struck even as recently as ten years ago, we would have been stuck listening to whichever experts an overwhelmed media corps happened to have in their rolodex. Today we can be significantly more informed, but this vision of an information-rich pandemic response is not flawless. Twitter was optimized for links and short musings. Its not well-suited for complex discussions or nuanced analyses. As a result, the feeds of these newly-emerged pandemic experts are often a messy jumble of re-ups, unrolled threads, and screenshot excerpts of articles. We can do better.
We need to augment social platforms with a surge in capacity of the original Web 2.0 technology that these upstarts so effectively displaced: blogs. We need WordPress-style sites featuring both easy-to-update static pages and chronological posts. These sites could be hosted by institutions with some degree of public trust and a reasonable technology infrastructure, such as universities, medical centers, and think tanks. Some mild gatekeeping could be performed on the experts granted blogs by these institutions, and, critically, IT support could be provided so that the experts could start publishing with minimal overhead. If possible, there would be a similar look-and-feel to these sites hosted at various institutions, providing the sense that they all belong to the same cohesive extended information network."

According to news reports, Birx was frustrated at the agencys tally of coronavirus deaths, as she and colleagues worried that reported numbers were up to 25 percent too high. However, if some people inside the Beltway think the counts are inflated, others think theyre too lowand the seemingly simple task of tabulating bodies has become an intensely political act.
It's a bizarre situation, because in some sense, there's nothing more inherently impartial than a tally of objects. This is why the act of counting is the gateway from our subjective, messy world of confused half-truths into the objective, Platonic realm of indisputable facts and natural laws. Science almost always begins with counting, with figuring out how to measure or tabulate something in a consistent, reproducible way. Yet even that very first rung on the ladder to scientific understanding is slippery when the act of counting gets entangled with money or power.
The arguments over the number of Covid-19 victims are just the latest battles in a political war over countinga war that's several decades old and has been waged on several fronts. Even under normal circumstances, 2020 would have seen some major fighting over counting: of votes in the Presidential election and of citizens in the U.S. Census. The pandemic adds a third high-stakes tally with profound political repercussions. As it happens, all three counts present parallel questions that Democrats and Republicans attempt to answer in diametrically opposite ways. And, at this point, it is far from clear which side will prevail.
The arguments over the number of Covid-19 victims are just the latest battles in a political war over countinga war that's several decades old and has been waged on several fronts.
Counting is harder than it looks, especially when it comes to the sorts of tabulations that determine whether powerful people get to maintain their power. Like voting. With rareexceptions, there's no controversy about how to count a given vote; once a ballot has been inserted in the ballot box, it's pretty obvious how it should be tallied. Instead, the fights tend to be over whose votes get counted and whose don't.
In the past few years, the Republican Party has been pushing for anti-voter-fraud measures, such as purging voter rolls and tightening identification requirements to cast a ballot. Democrats, on the other hand, have been trying to broaden the voting base, making absentee ballots more widely available and attempting to restore voting rights of ex-felons. This isn't a coincidence. These schemes to restrict or expand the franchise will hurt or help voters who face the greatest barriers to voting: poorer citizens; minorities; non-native-English speakers; those who have the least success with (and least inclination toward) engaging with their local governmental agencies. These voters tend to lean Democratic, so erecting barriers to voting disproportionately hurts Democrats, while removing impediments helps them.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Even a tally as seemingly straightforward as the decennial Censusa Constitutional obligation to count every head in the United Stateshas been subject to political skirmishes over the past several decades. The central issue in these fights, such as the latest one over whether or not to include a question about immigration status, also tends to involve the question of counting minorities, non-native English speakers, immigrants, and people in the lower income brackets.
Unlike a vote, which is a purely political creation, a Census is an attempt to measure a property of the natural world: how many humans reside in a certain territory. Yet Census statisticians have long known that no matter how hard they try to count the population, they fail; just as certain animals are harder to spot than others, certain segments of the population are harder to count. People who rent properties, for example, are, by virtue of their lack of fixed address, more difficult to track down. People distrustful of government because of their immigration status, for another, are also less likely to return a questionnaire. In the 2010 Census, this led to people identifying as Hispanic being undercounted by an estimated 1.5 percent; African-Americans by 2 percent; Native Americans living on reservations by almost 5 percent. White people, on the other hand, were overcounted by almost 1 percent."

Feathers only declining market is New York City, which is still reeling from Covid-19 and losing residents, while the cities that havent been as impacted are not seeing the same kind of exodus. Reno suspects that the economic crisis is making Feather more appealing. Home rentals tend to increase during any type of recession or depression pretty significantly, he says. The same could be true with furniture as well. A lot of people are realizing they actually care about flexibility, and it's also more financially prudent for them now to not have to buy it.

Everset, a New York-based furniture rental startup, also lost some of its expected local customer base in the city, like students who ordinarily would be moving into Manhattan. However, its business is nonetheless also up. Everset had to hire extra employees in order to cater to a new genre of customeraffluent people who left New York for the suburbs and nearby rural enclaves and want a no-hassle furniture set delivered. People are fleeing the city to rent homes in Westchester, New Jersey, Long Island, and Connecticut. We are getting a lot of demand from people who need furniture in those situations, CEO Gavin Steinberg says. It's changed our business a little.
While many traditional rental car companies are struggling, peer-to-peer rental platform Turo is weathering the collapse of travel because some of its renters are now using its cars in lieu of public transit for local errands, and as places to get some alone time. San Diego-based host Jon Wilson says his business hasnt dropped significantly, but the demographics of his renters abruptly shifted. Generally tourists account for 65 to 75 percent of my booking. This has done a complete switch, he says. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, locals have accounted for 90 percent of all my rentals.
This change is happening all over the platform. The marketplace changed dramatically from being the majority of folks using Turo for travel to the majority of people starting to use Turo for local mobility, CEO Steve Webb says. The company also recently surveyed users about the shifts in their behavior and found that 13 percent of riders were actually using the cars as mobile workspaces. I didnt expect it to be that high! Webb says. Even higher: A quarter of the respondents cited a desire for personal space as their motivator.
That doesnt mean that people arent seriously rethinking the drawbacks of renting versus owning, especially as they use this moment to rethink their consumption habits more broadly. Boston College sociology professor Juliet Schor, who studies consumerism, says there has already been an observable spike in car sales in China post-lockdown. I think that has to do with fears about renting and a lot of unwillingness to go on public transportation, she says. As The Wall Street Journal recently noted, automakers are reporting increased interest in car ownership in the United States. However, the vast economic uncertainty that has accompanied the pandemic means that people are unlikely to make a lasting jump away from rentalsplunking down the money to purchase something outright is often simply not feasible.
Some people see renting as an attainable way to access experiences and things they couldnt buy outright right now. Andrine Robinson, a Turo user who lives in Atlanta, cited its affordability as the main reason shes using it through the pandemic. It gives us that option of splurging a little bit, giving us the lavish lifestyle on an economical budget, she says. In an uncertain springtime, ephemerality should be the rental economys biggest weakness, as people crave stability and a sense of ownership. But the rental economy companies succeeding right now have managed to turn that weakness into the crux of their sales pitchif you dont know what tomorrow holds, rentals that make today a little easier can look like a logical choice."

President Donald Trump said hes taking antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine and zinc because he believes the drugs could prevent COVID-19. 
Heres my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it, he said today in a White House roundtable with restaurant executives. Trump said hes been taking the drugs every day for a week and a half and that he has not had any COVID-19 symptoms. People close to the president, including one of Trumps valets and Vice President Mike Pences press secretary, recently tested positive for the virus. 
Side effects include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness
There is still no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine can prevent someone from contracting or getting sick from the coronavirus. Its a possibility a number of research groups are running clinical trials to see if the drug could protect health care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus from getting sick but no data from those studies is available yet. 
Trump said hes following the lead of frontline workers. You look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative, he said. While there are clinical trials looking specifically at using the drug as a preventive for health care workers, it is still not clear how many health care workers are taking the drug. Side effects of hydroxychloroquine include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness.
Trump spent weeks promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His administration reportedly pushed the Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to authorize the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of the hospital, based on meager evidence. While early data showed that hydroxychloroquine may help some patients, additional studies found that it wasnt effective and could have dangerous side effects, especially in people with severe symptoms. Trump stopped touting the drug after that data was publicized. In April, the FDA warned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside the hospital or a clinical trial.
While Trump says that he is taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, that cant be independently verified. All the public has is his word, and neither henor his White House has been reliable sources of information during this pandemic. Among other things, Trump has spent the pandemic publicly recommending treatment strategies for COVID-19 based on limited evidence. In late April, he appeared to suggest that Lysol injections could cure the disease. No therapies have been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. 
At time of publication, more than 90,000 people in the United States have died of the disease.

This week, a person incarcerated in King County Jail in downtown Seattle was taken to the hospital after they were suspected of having the new coronavirus. The county says there are no cases currently in the jail, but the new virus remains a huge concern for correctional facilities, particularly in outbreak hotspots like King County. With 85 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the county is home to the largest known hotspot of cases of the new coronavirus in the United States. 
Its only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus enters a US jail or prisons, says Tyler Winkelman, co-director of the Health, Homelessness, and Criminal Justice Lab at the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute in Minneapolis. All prisons and jails should anticipate that the coronavirus will enter their facility, and they need to have plans for monitoring and treating anyone who has symptoms, he says.
People regularly cycle in and out of jails and prisons, people who work in them leave and return daily, and visitors regularly stream through. Viruses of all kinds have multiple entry points, and those that enter tend to spread fast. Outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in these facilities, and during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases.
We know the coronavirus spreads quickly in closed spaces, like cruise ships, nursing homes and jails and prisons, Winkelman says. Many people who are incarcerated also have chronic conditions, like diabetes or HIV, which makes them vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19. 
One way to reduce the impact of the virus on jails and prisons, Winkelman says, is to avoid holding people for low-level offenses. In Iran, officials temporarily released tens of thousands of people determined to not be a risk to the public from prisons in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. People who arent a risk to public safety shouldnt be held in a jail just because theyre not able to pay a bond, he says. We are increasing their health risk by keeping them, he says. This is a time to make sure we have as few people at risk as possible. 
In Sonoma County, California, the jail is screening people at booking for symptoms and asking them about their travel history and contact with people who may be sick. Those types of screenings are critical, Winkelman says. It is essential that correctional staff are working with officials to make sure no one ill is entering a facility.
Some jails and prisons in the US may be prepared to screen, monitor, and treat people suspected of having COVID-19. But others are far from equipped to handle it. Health care centers in correctional facilities are often substandard and understaffed, which may mean people held in them arent monitored regularly enough. Symptoms need to be addressed quickly, not once a week or twice a week, Winkelman says. Isolating people suspected of having the virus could also be a challenge in some facilities the Hennepin County jail has four isolation rooms and set up some spaces for quarantines, but other places might not have the same capabilities, he says. 
Homer Venters, former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system, wrote in The Hillthat jails and prisons need to prepare now. [They] need to have a plan in place to identify and house together people with suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 and those who are at high risk of serious illness if they become infected, he wrote. Many facilities struggled to do so during the outbreaks of H1N1, he said, because jails typically house people based on the level of security they need not their health status. 
Standard public health interventions, like flu shots, are even more important during disease outbreaks if fewer people get the flu, they can stay out of health care facilities and leave more resources available for those who really need it. We dont want there to be outbreaks of multiple illnesses at once, Winkelman says. Many jails and prisons, though, dont regularly provide flu shots. Over half of US jails did not receive H1N1 vaccines when they became available. Under 10 percent of people in Maine correctional facilities received flu shots in 2011, which contributed to outbreaks. 
People in jails and prisons also may not be able to regularly wash their hands, which may promote the spread of disease. Hand sanitizer, which contains alcohol, is usually considered contraband. 
COVID-19 outbreaks in and around jails and prisons dont just have health impacts for people within the justice system. If public health officials recommend that courts not meet during outbreaks, people might be held for longer than necessary. It might be challenging for people on probation to meet with supervisors or fulfill community supervision requirements if there are restrictions on movement in an area. It may also mean that there would be less programing and movement within a facility. Likely, at some point, visiting would be shut down, Winkelman says. That can increase isolation and anxiety during a period of incarceration.
Vulnerable communities like people held in prisons and jails are often most at risk during public health emergencies they have fewer protections from an outbreak, and may face more significant fallout from any disruptions in daily life. But protecting communities from infectious diseases means protecting everyone, including those who arent as able to protect themselves. Jail and prison health care is public health. Its community health, Winkelman says.

Amazon is building a lab to test its workers for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Its the latest effort by the company to protect workers who are growing increasingly panicked as the virus spreads through Amazon warehouses. 
More than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed cases in the US, according to data compiled by the Financial Times, several with multiple instances of the virus.
In a blog post announcing the effort, Amazon says that a shortage of testing capacity is making it difficult to keep people safe and to get the economy back up and running. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence, the company said. Unfortunately, today we live in a world of scarcity where COVID-19 testing is heavily rationed.
Amazon is reallocating its own specialists to build the lab, and hopes to begin testing soon. A team of Amazonians with a variety of skills from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers have moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative, said Amazon. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our front-line employees soon.
We are not sure how far we will get... but we think its worth trying
Amazon has remained open throughout the pandemic, making it easier for many people to safely follow shelter-at-home orders. But that has put hundreds of thousands of front-line warehouse workers and delivery drivers at risk. To meet surging demand, Amazon announced plans to increase pay and hire an additional 100,000 workers back in March. The company has also been distributing masks, conducting employee temperature checks, and spraying disinfectant on work stations.

Airlines slashed routes, public transit use plummeted, ridership on Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing platforms dropped and shared scooter companies pulled products from city streets. Meanwhile, e-bike sales bloomed and on-demand delivery, including services using autonomous robots, exploded.
Transportation companies have been forced to adapt quickly to this new reality. Uber, for example, found itself in a position where it felt both right to lay off thousands of employees as it planned to inject $170 million into micromobility startup Lime.
The upshot: Along with the pain, crises can also be a catalyst for innovation. TechCrunch spoke to seven venture capitalists about how COVID-19 affected their portfolio and investment strategy, and asked their advice for startup founders as well as where they think the next and overlooked hot opportunity will be:
How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? 
Early-stage venture capital is about investing in the steady growth and potential of a business over time. Were in it for the long term, and the economy will eventually rebound. Were preserving dry powder for existing investments, but at the same time, Im reminded that some of the best venture-backed businesses were founded and funded during recessionary times (e.g. Google, Salesforce, Instagram). So were keeping our eyes open for promising young startups too.
What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?
COVID-19 is an existential event in all of our lives and businesses. Stay positive and be empathetic protect your employees and communicate often, maintain the financial health of your business and know you need to adapt to the change that will continue to happen."

Talks have included everything from long-term rent delays to a universal basic income (UBI). But if policymakers want to do more than just keep the floor from falling out and start laying the groundwork for an actual recovery, then they ought to be discussing a different UBI as well: Universal Basic Internet.
Just as the electrification of America brought the nation out of the Great Depression, the Wi-Fi-cation of the nation can ease us out of the COVID-19 collapse. Consider that in 1932, a mere 10% of rural Americans had electricity. As a result, a divide in opportunity emerged: On one hand, city-dwellers had the modern infrastructure required to enjoy a standard of living that would allow them to fully pursue the American Dream; on the other, millions of Americans were literally in the dark (or, at least, candle-lit dimness).
That’s why the electrification of American became a central plank of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Great Depression recovery plan. But his plan wasnt just to turn the lights on, it was to empower communities by making them the owners of their newly generated electricity. So under FDRs guidance, Congress created the Rural Electrification Administration (REA).
The REA didnt just barge into rural towns, install electricity and leave. Instead, the REA took two critical steps to make it a truly transformative agency: (1) it employed and empowered community members and (2) it taught people how to make the most of their newfound light. On step one, the REA relied on local partners to organize cooperatives that would supply the labor to build their community’s own electricity system.
By engaging community members, the REA turned users into owners and, consequently, did much more for rural America than would have been possible under federal auspices alone. On step two, the REA launched an “electric circus” that sent REA staff to educate new electricity users on how best to operate equipment, perform chores, cook and, of course, stay safe. This circus was more like a civic service program that facilitated a knowledge transfer from those who knew electrified life to those being exposed to the possibilities generated by electricity for the first time.
If the Great Depression showed rural America had been left in the dark, COVID-19 has revealed the plight of the millions of Americans left offline. Forced to shelter in place, Americans have been reintroduced to the centrality of high-speed internet to learning, working and simply living. But there’s an expansive digital divide between those with high-speed internet and those left searching for access to affordable broadband. Approximately 28% of Americans in rural areas do not have access to or cannot afford broadband the rate is 23% in urban areas.
The digital divide exists on a racial dimension as well whites are more likely than blacks or Latinx residents to report having broadband access at home.
America needs Universal Basic Internet. Achieving UBI requires a coordinated federal effort that, like the REA, (1) involves local stakeholders as a way to increase employment and civic pride and (2) creates an internet circus of trainers to increase digital literacy around the nation. This approach to closing the digital divide will go a long way in helping the nation recover from the COVID collapse.
FDR was rightfully proud of the REA. He realized that the federal government had to get involved because the private sector had failed to provide an essential service for Americans.
He noted that it is particularly important that extensions of rural electrification be planned in such a way as to provide service on an area basis. The practice has been too frequent in the past for private utility companies to undertake to serve only the more prosperous and more populous rural sections. As a result, families in less favored and in sparsely settled sections were left unserved.
Sound familiar?
The government has delegated providing access to internet to the private sector for far too long. Only the more prosperous have been able to enjoy the full benefits of high-speed internet. The disparity in access can be explained by economics: Its not cheap to ensure every American has the connectivity required to thrive. Way back in 2010, the National Broadband Plan estimated that closing the digital divide would take at least $24 billion. If the upfront costs werent daunting enough, the costs of building out a broadband network rise as the distance to reach end users increases; in other words, the least dense areas are the most expensive to serve. So it comes as no surprise that private actors have opted to instead service dense, urban areas.
Thats why the government must and can seize this crisis to close the digital divide. In the words of Rahm Emanuel, a crisis is an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before. House Democrats just released a $3 trillion stimulus plan surely, theres a couple billion to spend on a Universal Basic Internet plan.
To those worried that the spending wont generate enough of a return, the math makes clear that closing the digital divide will generate a digital dividend. There’s no easy to way to measure the impact of broadband access on the economy, but several studies indicate that this is exactly the sort of investment we should make in a time of crisis: some have estimated that doubling broadband speeds adds around 0.3% to GDP growth; others forecast that every broadband-related job generates between 2.5 and 4.0 additional jobs; and, yet another study determined that a 10 percentage point increase in broadband access could increase GDP per capita by $13,036. Simply put, theres a high ROI — return on internet — associated with increasing broadband access.
President Lincoln, who guided the nation through its most trying times, stated that “[t]he legitimate object of government is to do for the community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot do as well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities.”
The digital divide is not a problem any American can solve alone. So, its time for the government to bring the internet circus to town after town and make sure that Universal Basic Internet becomes a reality."

The retail giant is nothing if not an essential business for many in the U.S. and abroad, as everyday tasks like going to the supermarket and drugstore have become hazardous. 
While the company has continued providing necessary supplies for many, its labor policies have entered the spotlight certainly not a first for Amazon. While the company has consistently batted away suggestions of unfair or unsafe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of workers this week have planned mass protests of policies. 
Workers’ rights group United for Respect says more than 300 Amazon employees from 50 facilities plan to take part in the protest. The organization writes, Amazons response to the Coronavirus outbreak has unnecessarily put the lives of Amazon employees at increased risk and exposure, citing a large number of facilities where employees have contracted the virus. 
The organization calls for additional transparency around confirmed COVID-19 cases, more sanitation and various additional benefits, including two weeks of paid sick leave and health for part-time, drivers, temporary and contracted associates.
Amazon sent a strongly worded denial to TechCrunch, calling reports of the protests overblown and reiterating its record.
Reports of employee participation in todays event organized by labor unions are grossly exaggerated,  Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski said in the statement. Already today more than 250,000 people have come to work today, even more than last week to serve their communities. We couldnt be more grateful and proud for their efforts during this time. The union organizers claims are also simply false whats true is that masks, temperature checks, hand sanitizer, increased time off, increased pay, and more are standard across our network because we care deeply about the health and safety of our employees. We encourage anyone to compare the health and safety measures Amazon has taken, and the speed of their implementation, during this crisis with other retailers.
Last week, two additional employees reported firings they believed were tied to their public criticism of Amazon policy. In March, a Staten Island employee who was critical of working conditions was also fired. 
Amazon denied the connection. We support every employees right to criticize their employers working conditions, it told TechCrunch, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies."

If so, it wouldn’t be the first time the Lagos-based payments company’s plans for going public were postponed; the tech world has been anticipating Interswitch’s stock market debut since 2016.
For the continent’s innovation ecosystem, there’s a lot riding on the digital finance company’s IPO. After e-commerce venture Jumia, it would become only the second listing of a VC-backed African tech company on a major exchange. And Interswitch’s stock market debut when it occurs could bring more investor attention and less controversy to the region’s startup scene.
TechCrunch reached out to Interswitch on the window for listing, but the company declined to comment. The tech firm’s path from startup to IPO aspirant traces back to the vision of founder Mitchell Elegbe, a Nigerian electrical engineering graduate whose entire career has pretty much been Interswitch.
Africa’s tech scene is still fairly young, but it does have a timeline with several definitive points. An early one would be the success of mobile money in East Africa, with the launch of Safaricom’s M-Pesa in 2007. Another is the notable wave of VC-backed startups and founders that launched around 2010.
Interswitch CEO Mitchell Elegbe (Photo Credits: Interswitch)
With Interswtich, Elegbe pre-dated both by a number of years, founding his fintech company back in 2002 to connect Nigeria’s largely disconnected banking system. The firm became a pioneer of the infrastructure to digitize Nigerias economy.
Interswitch created the first electronic switch whereby Nigerian financial institutions could communicate and thereby operate ATMs and point of sales operations. The company now provides much of the rails for Nigerias online banking system."

The world has changed for everyone, and nowhere is this more true than in fundraising.
Ive been investing in technology companies for over twenty years, and Ive seen how venture capitalists respond in bull and bear markets. I’ve supported companies through the downturns that followed the dot-com bubble and the global financial crisis, and witnessed how founders adapt to the new environment. This current pandemic is no different.
A growth company that only a few months ago was shopping for a $20 million, $30 million, or even $40 million Series B, with a choice of potential investors, must now acknowledge that the shelves may well have emptied.
VCs who were assessing potential new deals at the beginning of the year have had to abruptly adjust their focus: Q1 venture activity in Europe was under its 2019 average, and the figures for the coming months are likely to be much worse as the pipeline empties of deals that were already in progress.
The simple reason for this is that VCs are having to rapidly reallocate their two principal assets: time and capital. More time has to be spent stitching together deals for portfolio companies in need of fresh funding, with little support from outside money. As a result, funds will be putting more capital behind their existing companies, reducing the pool for new investments.
Added to those factors is uncertainty about pricing. VCs take their lead on valuation from the public markets, which have plummeted in tech, as elsewhere. The SEG index of listed SaaS stocks was down 26% year-to-date as of late March. With more pain likely ahead, few investors are going to commit to valuations that founders will accept until there is more certainty that the worst is behind us. A gap will open between newly cautious investors and founders unwilling to bear haircuts up to 50%, dramatic increases in dilution and even the prospect of down rounds. It will likely take quarters not weeks for that gulf to be bridged and for many deals to become possible again."

The news comes as the company is under scrutiny for failing to be more transparent about the wider number of infections among its warehouse workers. 
A spokesperson confirmed the reports of the death, telling TechCrunch, We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Randall, Ohio. Her family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting her fellow colleagues.
According to the company, the worker in North Randall, a village outside of Cleveland, was sent home from work on April 30. She received a positive test a little over a week later, on May 8. Amazon says it notified fellow employees of the death and has provided counseling to colleagues. 
The overall number of Amazon workers who have tested positive for the virus remains a mystery. The company stands by its decision not to disclose such information. We dont think that number is super valuable, it has said previously. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, it added: 
Our rates of infection are at or below the rates of the communities where we operate. We see that in our quarantine rates as well. Quarantine rates are a critical part to understanding whats happening in the workplace it shows that our hard work around social distancing is paying off. Unlike others who hide beyond HIPAA, we alert every person at the site anytime there is a confirmed diagnosis. This alert to employees is a direct text message noting when the person with the confirmed diagnosis was last in the building.
The lack of transparency is one of a number of sources of criticism surrounding Amazons COVID-19 response. 
While the company has repeatedly maintained that it has done all it can to protect the employees in its fulfillment centers, potential exposure to the virus among warehouse workers is difficult to avoid, even with the proper PPE. Earlier this month, a letter from 13 state attorneys general demanded that Amazon disclose the number of workers who have been impacted by the virus.
We have requested but not received information on how many of the Companies workers have been infected with COVID-19, and how many have died from it, the letter reads. Please provide a state-by-state breakdown for each Company with this information.
Earlier this week, The New York Times noted one particularly hard hit warehouse in northeastern Pennsylvania, where more than 100 workers have apparently tested positive for the virus. The exact figure is unknown, as Amazon will not disclose it. Yesterday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that at least 30 workers at the nearby Kenosha warehouse have tested positive for the virus. 
As more housebound Americans rely on Amazon for deliveries, workers have largely fallen under the essential services guidelines issued by many states. In mid-May, the company extended its $2 an hour hazard pay bonuses through the end of the month. Amazon confirmed that it will return to standard salaries, come June, stating: 
To thank employees and help meet increased demand, weve paid our team and partners nearly $800 million extra since COVID-19 started while continuing to offer full benefits from day one of employment. With demand stabilized, next month well return to our industry-leading starting wage of $15 an hour.
The company has been subject to additional scrutiny over the firing of several employees that have raised public concerns over its treatment of workers during the crisis. While Amazon has repeatedly denied the firings were retaliation, the reports were enough to warrant another letter, this time from a number of high-profile senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders."

But the wheels of the world keep turning, albeit slower than during normal times.
But where the world has faced challenges, the cybersecurity industry remains largely unscathed. In fact, some cybersecurity businesses are doing better than ever because cybersecurity has emerged as one of the few constants we all need even during a pandemic.
The vast majority of the global workforce is (or has been) working from home since the start of the lockdown, and the world had to quickly adjust. Tech companies pushed their technology and services to the cloud. Businesses had to shift from not just securing their office network but also preventing threats against their highly distributed employees working from their own homes. And, hackers are retooling their attacks to be coronavirus themed, making them far more likely to succeed.
All of these things and more need security. Or, as one investor told us: “Many of these trends were already underway, but COVID-19 is an accelerant.” That’s helped cybersecurity firms weather the storm of this pandemic.

Ariel Tseitlin, Scale Venture Partners
Security budgets haven’t been affected nearly as much as broader IT spend. We continue to see existing portfolio companies raise follow-on financings, and we continue to meet with companies for new potential investments. The big change in my criteria for new investments is that a company must be able to continue growing in the current environment. We don’t know how long this downturn will last, so I don’t buy into the promise of “as soon as the economy recovers, growth will resume.”
Shardul Shah, Index Ventures
On Microsoft’s last earnings call, chief executive Satya Nadella said: “As COVID-19 impacts every aspect of our work and life, we have seen two years worth of digital transformation in two months.” This acceleration has actually created momentum for a number of cybersecurity businesses, which is why the best companies continue to draw significant interest from investors.

With the economy staggering and so much general uncertainty, it seems caution would be the watchword of the day, especially in the enterprise. But enterprise investors aren’t necessarily looking at what’s going on right now.
As startups make their way into the enterprise, they often grow from a single product to a platform offering, which means such investments tend to be a long haul that can take a decade or longer to mature and exit or IPO. The bigger the approach, the longer the sales cycle, so even though sales motion could be stalling now, it doesn’t mean VCs are just giving up on these types of investments.
Savvy investors understand that this is going to be a long game, and the current situation driven by a worldwide pandemic won’t necessarily change their approach significantly.
We asked a number of enterprise investors if they have changed their approach in light of the pandemic and its knock-on economic impacts, how the current environment has changed their relationship with existing portfolio clients and how well those clients are coping with the new reality.

With the pandemic having such a huge impact on the economy, how has this changed your investment approach and the types of companies you are more likely to invest in?
We remain committed to our five core thesis areas: security &amp; infrastructure modernized, financial services rebuilt, work reimagined, data interconnected, and community activated. We break out each of our thesis areas into anywhere from 10-20 sub-sectors.
We have been continuously reprioritizing which sub-sectors will likely see business growth as well as opportunities to make a positive difference to a world grappling with COVID. There are still many unknowns and we closely watch company formation and funding to see where there might be particular concentration of entrepreneurial activity, which we take to be a positive sign that a market is robust and ready for significant investment.
Within enterprise software, we’ve unsurprisingly seen an acceleration in enterprise demand for communication and collaboration software. We’ve historically maintained a thesis that enterprise communication is an untapped, shadow set of data about workplace productivity and knowledge. With swaths of workers working remotely, capturing insights from these conversations provides a significant opportunity. This applies to industry verticals as much as it applies to functional software that sells across industries and focuses on a particular type of communication. We believe the key is that both employees and employers find these insights to be beneficial.
Lastly, we’ve also seen a growth in software and data that help enterprises navigate disruptions in supply, demand, or other aspects of their business."

For example, a recent flurry of extension rounds from Silicon Valleys hottest startups like Stripeand Robinhood seem to signal that the investment type has suddenly become cool.
Extensions evolving from unloved to hot is not the first time that a type of VC deal has gained, or lost luster. In past times, for example, raising consecutive rounds from the same lead investor was often perceived as a negative signal; why couldnt the startup find a new, different lead investor? Today, in contrast, venture capitalists are using inside rounds to double-down on winning startups, a way of helping ensure returns for their own backers.
The recent phenomenon of extensions becoming vogue is a tale of the times, in which the best startups get to play offense, and startups that cant show accelerating growth are left behind. Lets explore what has changed.
TechCrunch first wrote about the new extension-round trend after seeing what felt like a wave of the deals crop up. Some were large, like MariaDBs huge $25 million add-on to its Series C, or Robinhoods biblical $320 million addition to its Series F.
But most were smaller events like Sayari adding $2.5 million to its Series B, or CALA adding $3 million to its seed round. Even more recently, Eterneva raised another $3 million on top of its seed round, and also out this week was a million pounds more for Edinburgh-based Machine Labs seed round.
One reason for the growth of extension rounds in 2020 has been runway — making sure that a startup has enough. Upstarts often raise on an 18-month cadence. But because of COVID-19 and its constituent economic disruptions, many have reduced costs in a bid to bolster how long they have until their cash stores reach zero."

There are, however, some silver linings among the horrors of the deadliest pandemic in recent memory.

The simple truth of the matter is the world wasnt prepared for a virus of this magnitude. Its something thats played out in country after country, as the novel coronavirus has continued to devastate communities across borders. 
In spite of early warning signs, many nations the U.S. certainly included were caught off-guard, lacking the proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and other necessities required to battle the virus for a prolonged stretch. For many, taking on COVID-19 has required improvisation and resourcefulness both, thankfully, qualities found in good volumes among the maker community that helped give rise to 3D printing technology. 
If youve followed the technology even in passing over the last decade, youre no doubt aware how much time evangelists spend justifying the usefulness of 3D printing beyond the the confines of desktop hobbyists. The defensiveness is certainly understandable. Consumer 3D printing has all of the trapping of an overhyped boom and bust. The truth of the matter is that it simply wasnt ready for the mainstream moment many investors and members of the press were ready to thrust upon it. 
But even as desktop 3D printing companies begun to scale back or shutter at an alarming rate, the industry has continued to have success stories among those who have further innovated and targeted the right market. Formlabs jumps out amongst the desktop market, with Carbon presenting a success story on the industrial side of the fence. What unites both beyond innovation is a focus on real-world case uses."

It has also become a growing and vibrant homegrown startup ecosystem. The region has sprouted 19-plus unicorns, several exits and even a billion-dollar, single-round financing. The coronavirus pandemic, however, is having an outsized impact on Latin Americas startup activity compared to other regions, judging by Q1 2020 activity numbers and this is just the beginning.
When including the U.S., Western Europe (WEU), U.K., China and Latin America, the global startup innovation landscape experienced a 27% drop in Q1 2020 in terms of the number of deals completed compared to the previous quarter. Giving some comfort to venture capitalists and startup founders alike is that the amount of invested capital remained essentially constant. The average deal size increased across these regions up a matching 27%. So, from a global perspective, the venture capital community did fewer but larger deals, on average, during the quarter where COVID-19 started wreaking major havoc in the economy.
Looking at each of these innovation hubs individually, we see different levels of impact from, presumably, COVID-19 between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. Deal count for the U.S., WEU and U.K. each went down approximately 20% each. Fairly modest, all things considered. Chinas deal count, however, suffered almost a 50% drop while Latin Americas deal count went down almost 60%.
We also see a stark difference between these regions from an invested capital perspective. The U.S., WEU and U.K. each invested approximately 28% more capital in Q1 2020 as compared to Q4 2019, while Chinas and Latin Americas invested capital both went significantly down. China deployed a bit over one-third less capital and Latin America deployed a very significant two-thirds less."

The pandemic has also spurred many to find new ways to work and keep society moving amid physical distancing, stay-at-home orders and mass hospitalizations. For years, robotics and automation have been a looming presence in a number of fields ranging from shipping and fulfillment to construction sites and operating rooms. But the novel coronavirus could well be the disruption that accelerates the adoption of these technologies.
These changes take time, but because COVID-19 wont be disappearing any time soon, it seems likely that this era will transform many of the robotics- and automation-curious into full-fledged converts. How different would this moment be if we were bolstered by a workforce that couldn’t transmit viruses or call in sick?
Following recent surveys exploring COVID-19s impact on media, fintech startups and esports, along with an earlier exploration of robotics investments, weve asked the category’s top VCs to discuss how the pandemic will impact their portfolio companies:
How has COVID-19 impacted automation and the robotics investing landscape?
We just closed on a fresh $1 billion and are actively making new investments in automation. COVID-19 revealed that our just-in-time manufacturing and logistics infrastructure cannot react to unexpected change. We expect the best practices of tech companies: rapidly adopting new tools and quickly iterating on their products and processes to become common in the realm of manufacturing and logistics. Engineers will be handed credit cards to try the latest tools, building on open source will be widely embraced, and making bets on products from startups will become the norm in this industry which has its roots in the industrial revolution.
COVID-19 will also encourage employers to rethink workspace layouts; keeping workers at a distance makes for a safer work environment. Automation enables that distance, and we continue to seek amazing teams aiming to empower human workers through automation. COVID-19 has created a period of uncertainty relating to demand, which will impact manufacturers’ ability to purchase automation to meet that demand. We encourage automation startups to revisit their assumptions on customer purchasing patterns, knowing that automation will become a priority in our new normal."

Gina Bartasi, founder and CEO of NYC-based fertility center Kindbody, has pointed to macroeconomic trends responsible for the industrys consistent growth, such as the increase in single mothers by choice and the fact that heterosexual couples are waiting to have children and waiting to get married, and more and more same-sex couples are having children, which is relatively new.
Regardless of the increasing demand, disasters can disrupt fertility services: On March 17, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine directed U.S.-based fertility clinics to avoid initiating new treatments, push back nonemergency surgeries and shift care to telemedicine.

Relatedly, when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in August 2005 and created the nation’s costliest natural disaster, it was also one of five times since 1987 that frozen embryos were evacuated and protected during a natural disaster.
According to a study done by University of Wisconsin, following Katrina, displacement contributed to a 30% decline in birth cohort size. Black fertility fell, and remained 4% below expected values through 2010. By contrast, white fertility increased by 5%.

Department of Health in Washington State has reported the first death in the U.S. related to the coronavirus. 
10 with 9 posters participating
Health officials in Washington state reported three grim new features of the coronavirus situation in the US Saturday. They reported the countrys first death, the first case in a healthcare worker, and the first possible outbreak.
In a press briefing held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer at Public Health of Seattle and King County, announced that there are three new presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the county, including the person who died. All of the cases appear to be from undetected spread of the new coronavirus in the community. The cases were identified because the state just recently gained the ability to do its own testing.
Two of the cases are linked to a long-term care facility called Life Care in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle. One of the cases is in a healthcare worker at the facility, a woman in her 40s who is said to be in satisfactory condition. She has no known travel outside of the US. The other is a resident of the facility, a woman in her 70s. She is in serious condition.The cases likely represent the start of an outbreak at the facility, which has approximately 108 residents and 180 staff. So far, 27 residents and 25 staff have reported some COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Duchin said.
An outbreak of COVID-19 at a nursing home is particularly alarming since the data on the disease so far has clearly shown that the people most at risk of getting infected and having life-threatening disease are the elderly and people with underlying health conditionssuch as cardiovascular disease, lung conditions, and diabetes.
We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, Dr. Duchin said.
A team from the CDC is on its way to the facility to help manage the situation. This team is expected to arrive in Kirkland Saturday night.
The countrys first reported COVID-19 death was also in King County. The person who died was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. He died in a local hospital in Kirkland, but he was not a resident at Life Care and has no immediately known links to the facility. Health investigators are trying to track down how he was infected. (In an earlier press conference, President Trump had identified the person who died as a woman. That is incorrect. It was a man.)
The new informationa rapid escalation of the situation in the USfollows news of potential community spread in four separate areas of the US: two areas in California, and one in Oregon in addition to the Seattle and King County area.
This escalation raises our level of concern about the immediate threat of COVID-19 for certain communities, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said in the briefing. Still, the risk to the general public not in these areas is considered to be low, she said.
The new information brings the countrys tally to 69 cases and one death. That includes 47 cases in repatriated citizens (44 from the Diamond Princess and 3 from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began)."

A lot has happened during the COVID-19 lockdowns in terms of human behavior.
E-commerce seems to have grown at the same rate in the last two months as it did in the last seven years. PipeCandy has been analyzing the segments within e-commerce that stand to gain the most with this “once in a generation” change.
Image Credits: PipeCandy
One segment that has dominated the news and the M&amp;A cycles within e-commerce is direct-to-consumer. The segment moved from being a disruptor of old-guard CPG companies to a channel strategy that every CPG company is now embracing. With lackluster IPOs of the likes of Casper, the closing of disruptor brands like Brandless and Walmart’s decision to not pursue D2C acquisitions, the era of hyper-funded digital natives is over.
So what’s up with digital natives now? How has COVID-19 played out for the segment?
Firstly, a comparison that some of you may not take very kindly. We are comparing actual retail sales from the U.S. Census Bureau with unique visitors from our sample of nearly 1,000 digital native brands. The directionality alone tells the story, even if we can’t compare the same metrics.
Image Credits: PipeCandy
What’s interesting about furniture is that people are buying storage units and shelves and tables for their home offices. Also, they are spending on mattresses. The rest of the furniture categories aren’t finding traction. That said, this observation is limited to D2C.
Now let’s see some D2C categories and their traffic growth trends over different slices of time.
Image Credits: PipeCandy
What you see above is a set of D2C category median growth rates of April 2020 compared to average growth rates in various time slices in 2019. We took April 2020 as the anchor month and compared against (1) the monthly average for every brand in the previous year and, (2) the month where they had the peak traffic.
The idea was to see not just whether these brands grew in April 2020 but also to see if they hit their peaks they hit in 2019. We have a few other cuts in our report (Q1 2019 versus Q1 2020, accounting for launch PR-linked peaks, etc.).
Fitness, pets and grocery registered healthy growth compared to 2019 averages, while the declines in furniture, apparel and kids have been minimal (when compared to the carnage we see in retail). But, when we see the data cut for peak 2019 versus April 2020, we see fitness and pets as categories have been resilient. We are still not back to the glory days of D2C in several other categories. Several categories and companies have been having a second lease of life. So what seems like a jaded performance when compared to the peak of 2019 is actually good news for several brands. They’d have been counted out but for COVID-19.
One way to truly size up the impact of COVID-19 is to look at the traffic numbers of these brands in 2019 and project the trends for 2020 assuming it would be a normal world from the vantage point of December 2019 and compare them with how things actually panned out between January and April 2020. We did consider and account for blips in numbers due to launch/PR activities in our forecasting model. The more positive the deviation is of the actual from the forecast, the better the category is doing.
I can only hypothesize that a certain virus caused the change in the trajectory.
Without, further ado, here is what we found:
Image Credits: PipeCandy
Kids, cookware and kitchen tools, apparel, fine jewelry, fashion, women’s health, mattresses, furniture and skincare actually deviated negatively from the forecast. This is not to say that these categories declined. We are actually saying that these categories didn’t keep up with the growth trends they orchestrated in 2019. That said, the devil is in the details. For instance, within furniture, there is a category of D2C brands that sell shelves and office furniture. Consumers did invest in them heavily, presumably to allow participants in the Zoom call to absorb more the titles of the books stacked in those shelves than from the calls themselves.
Wine/spirits, grocery, fitness, baby care, pets and nutraceuticals did better than anticipated. Basically, anything that helped numb the reality (alcohol), sweeten the reality (food), distract from the reality (baby care and pets), survive the reality (fitness) or hallucinate an alternative reality (nutraceuticals) did well.
A summary of our findings (free) and a detailed report on the impact of COVID-19 on direct-to-consumer brands (behind paywall) can be found on PipeCandy’s website.
I will leave you with another interesting conclusion we arrived at, through further research that is currently underway: The spotlight category in e-commerce is not direct to consumer it is the mid-market and large pure-play e-commerce companies. It is one segment where the compounded quarterly growth rate of active companies is better than the 2019 average.
We will have more to share in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!"

In this COVID 19-era, “well” is a relative term. Lyft’s net losses did dramatically improve from the year-ago quarter (a loss of $398 million versus $1.1 billion in Q1 2019). However, Lyft was clear in its earnings call: COVID-19 had a profound impact on its customers and its business and the future was uncertain.
“It is impossible to accurately predict the duration and depth of the economic downturn we face,” Lyft CFO Brian Roberts said during an earnings call Wednesday afternoon. “Our business may be impacted for an extended period of time. So we must be prepared to adapt accordingly.”
The difficulty of predicting what will happen has hamstrung thousands of companies trying to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, Lyft withdrew its previously provided revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for full year 2020 because of the vast unknowns.
“Given this fluidity, it is impossible for us to predict with any certainty our results,” Roberts said. After the requisite warnings, Roberts did eventually provide an outlook for the second quarter and it isn’t pretty. The outlook focused on adjusted EBITDA, which doesn’t give the most complete financial picture. It provides enough to understand that even with considerable cost-cutting measures, Lyft will suffer losses nearly four times wider than the first quarter.
Roberts said Lyft can manage to keep its second quarter adjusted EBITDA loss under $360 million if rides on its rideshare platform remain at April levels which were down 75% year-over-year for the remainder of the quarter. Lyft reported Wednesday an adjusted EBITDA loss of $85.2 million in the first quarter.
There are some early signs of a recovery. Ridership in the week ended May 3 was up 21% from the lows experienced in mid-April, according to Lyft. However, Lyft can’t afford to simply hope rideshare will return. It has to and already has enact a plan that will allow it to navigate the pandemic and come out as a survivor. In other words, Lyft will be judged at how well can stem the losses and find new revenue streams.
Work to cut costs has already started.
The company put together an aggressive plan to strengthen its financial position, Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green said during the earnings call. Lyft reduced its more than 5,000-person workforce by 17% and furloughed nearly another 300. Lyft also initiated a three-month pay reduction for all salaried employees, ranging from 10% for its most non-hourly team members, up to 30% for its senior leadership team and board members.
“Every other expense line is being scrutinized and no stone will be left unturned,” Green said.
The company expects to be able to cut its annualized fixed costs by $300 million by the end of the year. The reductions are based on its original expectations for 2020. Lyft has also ended rider coupons once ridership began to decline in mid-March and paused adding new drivers in nearly all markets.
“This reduces costs we incur associated with onboarding new drivers and helps protect utilization and earnings opportunities for existing drivers during this time of lower ride demand,” Green said.
Lyft reduced its 2020 capital expenditure plan by $250 million. And its sought out cost savings on the insurance front. (The company’s primary auto insurance policies expire at the end of September; Roberts said they’re considering the best options to reduce future volatility, as well as lower overall costs.)
The company is also shifting attention and resources to projects that executives believe will improve its unit economics. Finding those revenue streams will be tricky. Lyft has already provided a few clues of where it’s headed.
The company will continue with its Essential Deliveries pilot that launched April 15. The initiative lets government agencies, local non-profits, businesses and healthcare organizations request on-demand delivery of meals, groceries, life-sustaining medical supplies, hygiene products and home necessities.
Green said the company will evaluate any future opportunities based on how it performs. But he quickly added “that we have no interest in launching a consumer food delivery service. And so, we will not be doing that.”
Green also seemed cautiously optimistic about a new lost cost product called “Wait and Save,” that allows Lyft optimize the marketplace and be more efficient with matching drivers and riders."

The size and scope of the move is not clear at the moment, but the moves are clearly significant as the well-funded A.R. startup struggles to adapt to the harsh reality of the current pandemic. 
The layoffs also comes as the hardware maker has increased focus on enterprise applications. Late last year, it announced the release of the Magic Leap Enterprise Suite, a $3,000 package designed to take on the more lucrative business side of augmented and mixed reality, joining the likes of Microsofts Hololens. 
The open letter attempts to strike a hopeful tone, both in terms of its IP portfolio and the role its technology might play as more organizations actively explore virtual interactions. 
The post-COVID economy will be one of resiliency and the ability for businesses to operate across vast distances and connect with their customers in ways that mimic physical interactions, founder/CEO Rony Abovitz writes, but benefit from the speed and scale of high-speed networks, will be critical. Spatial computing will very much be part of that coming economic change.

After reporting a 13% year-over-year drop for global smartphone shipments, the firm is back with even worse numbers for China. Shipments dropped 18% year-over-year for Q1 in the worlds largest smartphone market. And once again, the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame. 
It tracks that China was hard hit for Q1, as it was the first to suffer from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The first known case dates back to mid-November, with its eventual spread having a major impact on both local buying habits and the global supply chain, much of which is headquartered in China. The 72.6 million shipments puts the number at its lowest point since 2013.
The figures could have been worse, of course. While an 18% is pretty massive for an industry that had struggled to grow well before the virus emerged, Canalys says the figures were saved from a further skid due to the smartphones current status as an essential product.
The smartphones status as an essential personal item has stopped the market falling further during the pandemic, Canalys VP Nicole says in a statement. The Q1 performance was also buoyed by Chinas well-established ecommerce channel for smartphone distribution, and the fact that most Chinese businesses were able to resume work rapidly after two weeks of nationwide travel restrictions. Unfortunately, the same conditions do not apply in any other major markets in the world.
Still, analysts are cautious about the markets ability to rebound in China, let alone the rest of the world, with a number of countries still very much in the throes of the pandemic."

Strikes began today at six warehouses and are set to continue through end of day Tuesday. 
The company has drawn international criticism for its decision not to disclose official COVID-19 infection rates among workers, but a representative for Berlin-based labor union Verdi (Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft or German United Services Trade Union) says theyre aware of at least 30 to 40 workers in the Bad Hersfeld factory in Central Germany who have been infected with the virus. 
Other striking factories include Koblenz, Leipzig, Rheinberg and Werne. Germany represents Amazons largest non-U.S. market, and is one that has seen its fair share of worker protests. Strikes were planned for Prime Days in both 2018 and 2019. But the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for the online retail giant.
As it has done with other recent criticism, the company denied suggestions that its working conditions are unsafe and pointed to various COVID-19-related initiatives. 
The majority of our associates does not participate and we see no impact on customer orders. The fact that more than 8,000 of our over 13,000 permanent associates in Germany are with us for more than five years proves that we are a fair employer, a spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Everything the union demands is already in place: Wages at the upper end from what is paid for similar jobs, career opportunities and a safe working environment,. The facts are: By end of June, we will have invested approximately $4 billion worldwide on COVID-related initiatives getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.
Here in the States, the company has drawn criticism from media and politicians alike for its action on COVID-19, including the firing of multiple workers who have been vocally critical of its policies."

The impact of COVID-19 was lessened slightly by IT departments and individuals adapting to the new remote working realty, but the numbers were far from ideal overall, due in no small part to issues with the supply, as the virus hit China and other parts of Asia. 
According to numbers from Gartner, Q2 has seen the beginning of a rebound. It’s not a huge bump, mind, but at 2.8% year-over-year, its a notable increase after a rough first quarter. There are a couple of reasons for the growth here. First is the aforementioned interest in upgrading home setups for work and school. Second is from retailers, which have reopened in a number of locations and have begun to refill shelves after being cut off via the supply chain.

Lenovo stayed at the number one spot, with HP following close behind. The companies saw 4.2% and 17.1% increase in shipments, respectively. Dell, Apple and Acer rounded out the top five. All told, the U.S. market is up 3.5% for the quarter, as well. Mobile computers in particular saw the biggest growth, helping to curb some of the attrition among desktops. 
Notably, Gartner believes the growth will only be temporary, so take the good news where you can get it, PC makers. [T]his uptick in mobile PC demand will not continue beyond 2020, as shipments were mainly boosted by short-term business needs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa says in the release."

The big story: COVID-19 vaccine trials show promise
Two vaccine trials one conducted at the University of Oxford, and another by researchers in Wuhan both had promising results, with a vaccine leading to an increased antibody response, while also appearing to be safe for human use.
The Oxford team is now ready to move on to phase three trials these are the large-scale human trials that come before approval. However, my colleague Darrell Etherington warns against getting prematurely excited about these results:
It is very early to make too many assumptions about what these early trials indicate, however. For instance, we still dont really know how effective antibodies are in patients that have recovered from having COVID-19 once, so a lot more investigation is required by scientists in better understanding the efficacy of antibodies, and potentially vaccines, over the long term.

Yesterday news broke that Uber’s CTO Thuan Pham would leave the company (confirmed), and that the American technology giant is contemplating a huge staffing cut to reduce its cost structure. COVID-19 has changed how much people move around, hampering the ride-hailing company’s business.
If the cuts come to pass at the scale The Information reports is possible, they would be the steepest layoffs that we’ve heard of at Uber. And they would cap a reversal in fortune the company, which after a somewhat rocky IPO was enjoying fresh momentum in the later parts of 2019 and the start of 2020.
This morning we’re going back in time to rewind through Uber’s post-IPO financial timeline. The company reports earnings on May 7, 2020, a little over a week from today. With that event coming up, we’d best be caught up.
It’s hard to choose where to start today. We could go all the way back to Uber’s May 2019 IPO, for example. Instead, we’re going to kick off a month later (it will be clear why in a moment). Also we must be somewhat summary in the following, so not everything that happened is included. We’re only talking about the bits we need most. Let’s go:"

We’ve explored the theme a few times recently, once from a venture-capital perspective, and another time building from a chat with the CEO of Claris, an Apple subsidiary and an early proponent of low-code work.
Today we’re adding notes from a call with Appian CEO Matt Calkins that took place yesterday shortly after the company released its most recent earnings report.
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. You can read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.
Appian is built on low-code development. And, having gone public back in 2017, it is the first low-code IPO we can think of. With its Q2 results reported on August 6, we wanted to dig a bit more into what Calkins is seeing in today’s market so we can better understand what is driving demand for low, and no-code development specifically, and demand for business apps more generally in 2020.
As you can imagine, COVID-19 and the accelerating digital transformation are going to come up in our notes. But, first, let’s take a look at Appian’s quarter quickly before digging into how its low-code-focused CEO sees the world.
Appian had a pretty good Q2. The company reported $66.8 million in revenue for the three-month period, ahead of market expectations that it would report around $61 million, though collected analyst estimates varied. The low-code platform also beat on per-share profit, reporting a $0.12 per-share loss after adjustments. Analysts had expected a far worse $0.25 per-share deficit.
The period was better than expected, certainly, but it was not a quarter that showed sharp year-over-year growth. There’s a reason for that: Appian is currently shedding professional services revenue (lower-margin, human-powered stuff) for subscription incomes (higher-margin, software-powered stuff). So, as it exchanges one type of revenue for another with total subscription revenue rising a little over 12% in Q2 2020 compared to the year-ago quarter, and professional services revenue falling around 10%, the company’s growth will be slow but the resulting revenue mix improvement is material.
And most importantly, inside of its larger subscription result for the quarter ($41.4 million) were its cloud subscription revenues, worth $29.6 million for the quarter and up 30% compared to the year-ago period. Summing, the company’s least lucrative revenues are falling as its most lucrative accelerate at the fastest clip of any of its cohorts. That’s what you’d want to see if you are an Appian bull.
Shares in the technology company are up around 45% this year. And with that, we can get started."

Some shuttered. Hipcamp, a San Francisco-based startup that provides private land for people who want to go glamping or camping, found itself in a similar spot. (even though its entire sell is about getting you away from crowds).
Bookings took a precipitous drop as people sheltered-in-place, and we actually encouraged people to cancel, founder Alyssa Ravasio said in an interview. The startup conducted a round of layoffs back in April, citing economic uncertainties. One employee tells TechCrunch that 60% of the company was laid off in two weeks. Hipcamp did not comment directly on the number of layoffs.
Months later, Hipcamp is in a far better spot. When stay-at-home orders lifted, bookings spiked with people eager to get outside, which the CDC says is a safer activity than being inside a place with less ventilation. Ravasio says that Hipcamp has even brought back some employees it originally laid off. The startup is currently hiring.
Off this new momentum, Hipcamp today announced that it has acquired Australia-based landsharing startup Youcamp, marking its first expansion into an international market. With the new business, Hipcamp will acquire Youcamps existing 50,000 listings, bringing its total to 420,000 listings.
Hipcamp declined to disclose the financials of the deal at this time.
Youcamp, founded by James Woodford, was born in New South Wales in 2013. Similar to Hipcamp, Youcamp worked to draw urban-based adults to the great outdoors. For its 7 years as an independent company, Youcamp racked up listings by working directly with private landowners.
Ravasio says she made her first big international bet in Australia partly because of revenue predictability.
Expanding to the Southern Hemisphere also helps us account for natural seasonality with outdoor recreation. Between the US and Australia, its an endless summer, the founder said.
The entire team at Youcamp will join Hipcamp, adding five to Hipcamps staff, bringing its employee base to a total of 35
Along with the acquisition announcement, Hipcamp shared that it is officially launching in Canada . The startup already had a number of Canadian hosts, but it will now increase the total by partnering directly with private landowners.
The company declined to share profitability or growth statistics, but instead pointing to aggregate usage numbers as some sort of cumulative revenue parallel. To date, Hipcamp has helped people spend 2.5 million nights outside across 6,000 hosts in the United States. Australia, and Canada.
In July 2019, Hipcamp got a tranche of new capital from investors, including but not limited to Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark, Slow Ventures, Marcy Ventures (co-founded by Shawn Carter, or Jay-Z) and Dreamers Fund (co-founded by Will Smith). The round valued the startup at $127 million.
Hipcamp, which has been dubbed by the New Yorker the Airbnb of the outdoors, is more optimistic than it was in March, as shown by this appetite for acquisition. The progress mirrors what we’re seeing out of the actual Airbnb, which has found bookings increasing year over year as people look to stay at properties for local holidays."

With a virus this infectious, she adds, no precaution is superfluous in any circumstance.
But those precautions are only helpful to a point, according to Unroe. These outbreaks are continuing and theyre going to continue in nursing homes, she says. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about how and why the virus has spread so quickly in some homes, but not in others. Based on early data, she says: Its about the size of the facility and the amount of spread in your community.
Nevertheless, Unroe warns that while researchers are working furiously to figure out solutions, they still dont have all the answers: It's a turbulent time and we're trying to make clinical and operational decisions with incomplete information.
As San Francisco starts to reopen, SFCJLs Cmiel is nervous. This scares me to death, she says. I actually think we need to tighten up now that the city is reopening. If community transmission of the virus starts to increase in the city, nursing home residents will be at an even greater risk. But how long can people go without seeing their loved ones, or getting exercise or intellectual stimulation? Its this constant balance, adds Cmiel, between the safety and health of our residents and the needs of the families.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
A much more far-reaching approach to keep older people safe from Covid-19 would be to care for them in their homes, keeping them out of long-term residential settings. Two initiatives in California, Community-Based Adult Services and Multipurpose Senior Services Program (CBAS and MSSP, respectively), serve thousands of low-income seniorsthe majority of whom are people of color. The programs provide essential services like at-home nursing care, physical and emotional therapy, meals, and transportation that are on-par with the support received by residents in senior homes.
Out of the nearly 10,000 seniors served by MSSP, only three have died of Covid-19 so far, says Claire Ramsey, a senior staff attorney at Justice in Aging, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income seniors. This is a way safer way to provide care, she comments. Chodos notes that seniors who receive care in their homes also have lower rates of depression, and experience slower cognitive and physical decline. And home care is also usually what seniors would prefer, says Unroe: People should be cared for where they want to be cared for. Almost anyone would say that is in their homes.
Advocates say that nursing homes are necessary, but they shouldnt be the default care solution for seniors who need some assistance. There should be a continuum of care, and institutional care should really be reserved for people who need it, who cant be successful and safe in their own homes, says Ramsey.
But the economic effects of Covid-19 are forcing states to cut budgets; both California and New York have proposed cuts to programs that provide low-income seniors with at-home help that keeps them out of institutions. In the Golden State, Governor Gavin Newsoms revised budget will eliminate both CBAS and MSSP and reduce the hours of in-home care MediCal funds by 7 percent. New York state already has decided to limit eligibility to the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program, which pays for home nursing aides for disabled or chronically ill New Yorkers. Ramsey says that without these programs, many seniors will have no choice but to move into long-term care facilities. You are literally going to have more people die if you do this, she adds.
Another worry is that even if seniors arent forced into high-risk living situations, other cuts could jeopardize their overall health. Californias proposed budget would also cut eligibility for MediCal and eliminate optional MediCal benefits like podiatry, physical therapy, and diabetes prevention programs. Those benefits are important for keeping people healthy and alive, regardless of the threat from the novel coronavirus. One of the things were very worried about is how bad these are cumulatively for people, says Ramsey. Its really death by 1,000 cuts.

Yet here we are in 2020, and even lucky modern humans cant help but think the world is coming to an end. And really, the hints are there: the climate catastrophe, plagues of locusts, the Covid-19 pandemic and the attendant economic recessiona little more than a decade after the 2008 crashall of it the subject of cable news and social media reports, day in and day out. Its enough to make a person give up caring. Why not, if we're going to hell in a handcart? Let's just enjoy tomorrow, says Matthew Flinders, founding director of the Sir Bernard Crick Centre for the Public Understanding of Politics at the University of Sheffield.
Of late Flinders has been exploring the notion of crisis fatigue, or the idea that after years of constant bad news, perhaps weve grown numb to warnings from politicians of yet more bad news. In particular, he was worried that the British public would balk at shelter-in-place orders during the Covid-19 pandemicfinally issued in late March after the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, initially dilly-dallied in its response.
As the crisis drags on, might that fatigue set in across societies? And now that scientists have been thrust into the spotlight during the pandemic, might the distrust spread toward their leadership as well? What happens to society when so many crises collide? WIRED asked Flinders for his thoughts on how we got to this point, and how we might chart a path forward.
This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
WIRED: To begin, go over your thinking during the pandemic about the potential for crisis fatiguewhere it comes from, and how we might combat it.
Matthew Flinders: I would say that the phenomenon of crisis fatigue can exist at a number of different levels. For me, crisis fatigue is a very natural human response: The whole nature of crises is that they're new and shocking. And inevitably, as soon as you've thought about and lived with the crisis for a while, it becomes the new normal.
Originally, I started thinking about crisis fatigue specifically in relation to lockdown, because there was a big debate about how long realistically you could expect the British public to abide by very strict lockdown and social distancing rules. There was a strong perception coming from the behavioral sciences that you could only really expect the public to be in lockdown for two or three weeks. And this assumption was very critical, because it meant that the government tried to avoid going into lockdown for as long as it could in order not to use up that period too early, but almost to save it to flatten the peak.
Now, of course, what's happened is that it looks as if that strategy was not only wrong, but also the British public haven't fallen into crisis fatigue in quite the way I'd originally expectedbecause, if anything, the British public have been overwhelmingly compliant with social lockdown. The latest social surveys bizarrely show that the public is still so fearful they don't want to come out of lockdown.

I think what nobody is really understanding is that it is impossible to see this crisis as a completely separate entity to any other of the wave upon wave of crises that seemed to have crashed down upon the shores of the public for a least two decades. And what I think is interesting is that, particularly among the younger generations, the existence of some form of existential crisisbe it fiscal, environmental, democratic, medicalis the new normal. In many ways, the respite that you get now, between the next crisis crashing down on you, is increasingly small. And I wonder if that, at a deeper social psychological level, has some explanationparticularly for the UK. We went from one crisis around Brexit, which was an existential crisis about our position in the world. And just as we sort of resolved to get Brexit done, within days any sense of relief or calm was destroyed by the launch of Covid."

Health officials were so concerned that hospitals would be overwhelmed by patients that in March much of the world went into an unprecedented lockdown to flatten the curve, or to slow the rate of new infections to give facilities time to muster a response. Regions that acted quickly, like the San Francisco Bay Area, have so far succeededthose that stalled, like New York City, saw their hospitals flooded with patients. It got so bad in NYC that one hospital had to bring in a refrigerated semi-truck trailer to hold the dead.
Caring for so many extremely ill patients has taken an extraordinary emotional and physical toll on health workers from every nation. WIREDs video team reached out to 16 of themincluding doctors, physician assistants, paramedics and epidemiologistsand asked them about their experiences treating Covid-19 patients. Some of them saw their first coronavirus patients just days before filming began; others had already been battling the disease for weeks or months. Some had seen just a few patients, others hundreds. All, though, are dealing with a pandemic the likes of which the modern world has never seen.

Theyre having to make brutal decisions, like when to pull patients off ventilators, and where to allocate precious resources. They have to think twice about once-ordinary treatment regimens: Using aerosolized medications to treat asthma or wheezing could help spread the virus through the air. These health workers must take time away from their families, and they cant even see all of their patients. One doctor in Los Angeles, who travels to his clients homes, had to tell an 84-year-old patient he sees monthly that he could no longer enter the mans house, lest he bring the virus with him. Thats even with strict sanitization practices in place: This doctor wipes his car clean between patients; another puts all of his clothes in the wash and masks in the oven when he returns home, and then showers, a decontamination process that takes up to 45 minutes. Still others opt to shower at their workplaces.
Its taking a personal toll on them, too: Some people say they cant sleep, and even when they do, they have Covid-19 nightmares. Yet still they persist, support each other, take pride in their ability to help others in their communities, and steel themselves for what could be an even more punishing second wave of Covid-19 come winter.

This year is particularly bad, and timed terribly with Covid-19.",https://www.wired.com/story/saharan-dust-plumes-are-blowing-into-the-us/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ef3b90fab5844e130e245c7/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_dustcloud-1221952759.jpg",2020-06-25T11:00:00Z,"It doesn't help matters for any budding hurricanes that the dust in the SAL is absorbing heat from the sun as it travels across the Atlantic, creating still more atmospheric stability. Even worse for hurricanes, they need a calm environment in order to start spinning, but the SAL is barrelling in with 50-mile-per-hour winds. It tilts and it bends the tropical cyclone vortex as you go up in height, and it decouples and disrupts the storm's internal heat engine, as we call it, says Miller. What the storm wants is just a nice vertically-aligned vortex that it can transfer heat and moisture from the surface upward and out.
Forecast models can predict where the dust might land in the Americas, just like scientists would do with an approaching hurricane. Miller reckons that the plume currently working through the southern US could eventually make it to him in Colorado, albeit in a diminished form. Thats because of gravity: As the plume makes its way across the Atlantic, the larger particles fall out first, leaving the smaller particles to make landfall.
Air sampling stations throughout the US gather this particulate material for scientists to study. What we typically see is that the concentrations are highest in the southeast, more towards Florida, says Jenny Hand, senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. And as it moves farther north, the concentrations will go down, just as it sort of settles out, diffuses, and gets moved around. But we do see those impacts up into the Ohio River Valley pretty regularly in our data.
So what does that mean for respiratory health, especially with Covid-19 being a respiratory disease? Yeah, it's not good, says Hand. Especially now.
When you inhale dust, it travels deep into your lungs, triggering an inflammatory immune response. If your lungs are healthy, maybe this will manifest as a mild cough. But for others who have chronic inflammatory lung conditions, such as asthma or emphysema, this extra burden of inflammation can tip them over into severe breathing trouble, says Dr. W. Graham Carlos of the Indiana University School of Medicine and Eskenazi Health. We know, for example, that in many parts of the world that are afflicted with sand and dust storm events, such as the Middle East, we see more asthma and asthma attacks. He advises that people with respiratory conditions stay indoors until the plume passes. If you have to go outside, he says, wear an N95 mask: That type of mask filters those fine particles, fine enough to travel in the air across the Atlantic Ocean.
Carlos adds that researchers cant yet say whether inhaling the Saharan dust might predispose people to contracting Covid-19, or make the illness worse. I would caution, though, that Covid is also an inflammatory condition in the lungs, and that's in fact why people are needing ventilators and hospitals are surging, he says. So this could add insult to injury. In other words, you might have a low-grade inflammatory condition from the dust plume, and then if you were to get Covid on top of that, it may be worse.
As the weather cools in Africa starting in mid-August, that temperature differential between the desert and the forests to the south will weaken, zapping the SAL conveyor belt. The dust clouds will stop rolling across the Atlantic. Then we can all go back to just worrying about Covid-19 and microplastics and a melting Arctic."

These notions are especially true for social upheavals, where engaging the past involves questions more taxing than the ones Marie Kondo gave to us for spring cleaning: Do these relics make us feel good? When these relics are garments of clothing, we can say no, and away they go. With society, the relics that weigh us down can feel too complex to grasp or, more often, too inconvenient for us to want to engage with.
Nearly halfway through 2020, the world remains engulfed by the most explosive pandemic in over a century. Simultaneously, and not unrelatedly, neofascist populism manifests in unfamiliar settings, threatening democracy. In the United States, the last few months have delivered several visible test casesinvolving deaths of African Americans at the hand of law enforcementthat have served as public referenda on the value of black lives, again. Covid-19 and uprisings have left our status quo in peril, and a public looking for answers.
C. Brandon Ogbunu (@big_data_kane) is an assistant professor at Brown University who specializes in computational biology and genetics.
But the overlap of the pandemic and the protests against police violence is of a certain type: not quite familial, but instead, more like mirror images. Covid-19 and the uprisings are a kind of twin, where the features are identical but opposite. This manifests in their respective relationships with the past and future.
In the case of Covid-19, much of our obsession was, and remains, with future projection. This is the essence of the debate over the relevance of predictive models of disease, where citizen-scientists (of varied background and expertise) have sparred on social media, and less often in the scientific literature. The points of contention often involve the veracity and ethics of predictions. Some of the debates are justified: Erroneous calculations can drive bad policies and cost thousands of lives. Elaine Nsoesie, a computational epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, says, We shouldnt be too confident about our predictions of what will happen in the future. We should acknowledge uncertainty especially in the models that we develop. Unfortunately, the politicization of Covid-19 science has made productive debates about model projections untenable, as conflicts of interest now perniciously manifest in which ideas are entertained, almost independent of the science underlying them.
Our obsession with the Covid-19-shaped future is about far more than what the curve will look like in six months. The pandemic has also forced us to reconsider how we communicate, work, and learn. For example, higher education must now rethink how to maintain research activities, deliver high-quality instruction, and provide the informal social experience that college has historically provided. And there are new, important conversations about labor that have arisen.

According to the analyst firm, the category (including phones, tablets and PCs) is currently on track to decline 13.6% for the year.
COVID-19 is, naturally, largely to blame here. The virus has permeated virtually every sector of society, and hardware is certainly not immune. Phones are projected to take the biggest hit, down 14.6% from 2019. That list includes both dumb and smartphones, the latter of which now comprises most handset purchases. Smartphones as a category are down 13.7% year over year.
The smartphone market has been on a slide for recent years. But 2020 was going to be the year smartphone makers turned things around (for a little while, at least), thanks to the arrival of 5G. Like so many other things in this world, however, COVID-19 has put a damper on those figures, with the technology only expected to represent 11% of phone shipments for the year. 
Interestingly, PC shipments werent impacted as strongly as might have been expect. The decline is still sizable at 10.5%, but a push to implement work from home models for many employees has helped lessen the slide. In particular, laptops, Chromebooks and tablets appear to be the least impacted of the bunch."

It means hate-mongers cannot use these mainstream forms of social media to reach new audiences and harass their targets into silence. Because many of the men who were expelled rely on their own names to draw attention and donations, it will be difficult for them to sneak back onto these platforms and develop the same prominence they had before. Already this week, other racist and sexist communities and accounts that produce borderline content have been deleting old videos and increasing moderation. Do not mistake this for a chilling effect, though; its more like an acknowledgement that hateful instigation and harassment of women, people of color, and LGBTQ users will no longer be hidden under the guise of free speech.
Though Twitter and Facebook were not a part of Mondays anti-hate measures, the purge built off weeks of smaller actions that theyd taken. On Tuesday, Facebook followed up with bans and account removals for individuals associated with the Boogaloo faction, an anti-government group that has been showing up to Black Lives Matter rallies heavily armed and dressed in Hawaiian shirts. It also comes amid two public health crises: Covid-19 and systemic racism. Covid-19 appears to have led all the tech companies to move more aggressively, and concertedly, in recent months; and it laid the groundwork for their taking more action against racist content, as the nation wakes up to the urgency and ubiquity of white supremacy.
Not so long ago, before the pandemic hit, each platform would only tend to its specific user base, keeping up with a triple bottom line by balancing profits with social and environmental impact. Now, having witnessed the terrifying results of unchecked medical misinformation, the same companies understand the importance of ensuring access to timely, local, and relevant facts. After accepting that truth with regard to medical misinformation, its impossible to ignore that unchecked racist and misogynist content is terrifying, too, when its left out there for anyone to discover at any time. Sadly, we know the violence it brings in its wake. Sadly, we know that the twin crises of racism and Covid-19 are deeply intertwined.
Without a strategy for how to curate content, tech companies will always be one step behind media manipulators, disinformers, and purveyors of hate and fear.
We have seen purges before from YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. To maximize the benefits of this kind of action, though, we need a plan for what comes next. We cant let the gains from this great expulsion dissipate as political pressure mounts on tech companies to enforce a false neutrality about racist and misogynist content.
In April 2018, Zuckerberg addressed Congress and told them he would soon have 20,000 people working in security and content moderation. But without a strategy for how to curate content, tech companies will always be one step behind media manipulators, disinformers, and purveyors of hate and fear. Moderation is a plan to remove what is harmful; whereas curation actively finds what is helpful, contextual, and, most importantly, truthful.
Truth needs an advocate and it should come in the form of an enormous flock of librarians descending on Silicon Valley to create the internet we deserve, an information ecosystem that serves the people.The blessing and curse of social media is that it must remain open so we can reap the most benefits; but openness must be tempered with the strong and consistent curation and moderation that these librarians could provide, so that everyones voice is protected and amplified.
It is the duty of platform companies to curate content on contentious topics so that their systems do not amplify hate or make it profitable. Tech companies that refuse to adapt for the culture will become obsolete.

But it's still not justified.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-is-paying-way-too-much-for-remdesivir/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f0f7236b62e19a8767ef20e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/OpEd-Remdesivir-1209490986.jpg",2020-07-17T11:00:00Z,"Two weeks ago,news came out that the United States has secured the entire current global supply of remdesivir, one of the two drugs shown so far to be effective at treating Covid-19. Even for the richest nation in the world, this will be a massive expenditure: more than half a million treatment courses priced at $3,120 each for most hospitals, without any government attempt to negotiate a better price. In other words, the US healthcare system is poised to spend on the order of $1.5 billion for this medication. What justifies such a high price, especially given remdesivirs cost of production is roughly ten dollars per course?
Scholars and pharmaceutical executives defending remdesivirs price primarily anchor their arguments on three key points: (1) the drug provides substantial value, and thus is worth the price; (2) companies need to recoup the cost of research and development investment in the drug; and (3) high prices for remdesivir today incentivize future development of Covid-19 treatments. None of these arguments holds up.
Rohan Chalasani (@rohanchalasani) is a medical student at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Walid Gellad (@walidgellad) is a physician and policy researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, where he directs the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing.
Remdesivir certainly has value, but the data right now supports a price lower than what its maker, Gilead Sciences, Inc., is charging. A clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health found that the drug shortens recovery times for many Covid-19 patients. However, remdesivir has not yet been proven to reduce mortalityto save lives. While the NIH trial found a numerical improvement in survival, the difference did not reach conventional thresholds of statistical significance or certainty; and a smaller study published in the Lancet also did not find an improvement in mortality. If remdesivir does not offer a mortality benefit, then the Institute for Clinical and Economic Reviewan independent drug-pricing watchdogputs the value-based price benchmark for the drug at $310 per treatment course. Thats about one-tenth its current price. Even if a mortality benefit from remdesivir were eventually confirmed, ICER pegs its value-based price at $2,500 to $2,800 per course, still 10 to 20 percent lower than what we pay right now.
But, to step back, why should we even try to price drugs based on notions of value in the first place? We dont price any other life-saving healthcare service in that way. Heart transplants, trauma surgeries, emergency appendectomies and c-sectionsnone of these life-saving interventions are priced based on their value. If they were, their prices would range anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 per additional quality-adjusted life year they provided; and a life-saving surgery for an infant could carry a price tag in the hundreds of millions. Moreover, if remdesivir should be priced based on its value, then what about dexamethasone, a decades-old generic steroid, that was just found to reduce mortality in Covid-19 patients? That drug, often used to treat inflammation, costs less than $1.50 per 6-mg tablet today. Would it be okay if a generic drug company massively inflated the price overnight to align with its new value?
What about the cost of investmentdoes Gilead need to charge $3,120 for remdesivir to make up for all the time and money that the firm put into it? Even if it were appropriate to set a price based on a sunk costand most economists would argue that its notremdesivirs development has been buoyed by incredible amounts of government investment. The 2015 paper detailing the discovery of remdesivir was the product of a public-private partnership between scientists from Gilead, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; yet government employees were excluded from the molecules patent. Financially, remdesivirs development has been directly supported by at least $70 million of taxpayer moneyincluding funding for its initial discovery, studies of its effects on coronaviruses, and its Covid-19 clinical trials. Investment in remdesivir hasnt been Gileads alone, and the drugs price should accordingly reflect the contributions of taxpayer funds that offset the costs of its development and commercialization.

Finally, we arrive at remdesivirs price as an incentive for future drug development. This point of view was recently explained in a Washington Post op-ed from Northwestern University economist Craig Garthwaite, who argued that since remdesivir is not the last treatment for Covid-19 that well need, its price is a crucial signal to potential market participants. If remdesivir were too cheap, other companies might be disincentivized from pursuing the cures and vaccines we need."

Cooling centers, where folks without air-conditioning can go to chill, are shuttered. Public pools, too. And wandering malls is certainly out of the question. Skyrocketing evictions could mean more people are forced onto the street, completely exposed to the heat. Even among those who do have an air conditioner at home, people may have lost their jobs thanks to the Covid-19 economic slump and now cant afford to pay their utility bills.
Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.
Already, we knew before Covid that one in three American households was struggling to pay their energy bills, says Chandra Farley, director of the Just Energy program at the Partnership for Southern Equity, which promotes policies and institutional actions that advance racial equity. We knew folks were already keeping their homes at uncomfortable temperatures for fear of running up their bills.
The heat assault on lower-income households is twofold. For one, these residents spend a much bigger fraction of their income on energy bills than the rich do, a phenomenon known as the energy burden. And two, low-income neighborhoods are actually hotter than high-income ones all across the US, according to a 2019 joint analysis by National Public Radio and the University of Maryland's Howard Center for Investigative Journalism. That's because the suburbs are dotted with single-family homes separated by lots of greenery, which provides shade and cools the air via the evaporation of water from leaves. Urban neighborhoods tend to turn into heat islands, absorbing the suns energy during the day and slowly releasing it at night.
Low-income groups and communities of color are more likely to be located in urban heat islands, says Linda Rudolph, senior adviser at the Public Health Institute, a nonprofit that promotes health equity. These are areas that have fewer trees, less green space, more buildings, and more asphalt and concrete. Nighttime temperatures can be as much as 22 degrees higher than the surrounding area.
Residents of low-income communities have also historically had less access to health insurance and health care, even before the pandemic hit. These are also communities that have a higher underlying baseline prevalence of the illnesses that make people more susceptible to severe heat illness, says Rudolph. And those are the same illnesses that make people more susceptible to severe Covid outcomesso obesity, diabetes, respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease.
Extreme heat also worsens air pollution, which already disproportionately affects people of color, Farley notes. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, Black children are four times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than white children, and 10 times more likely to die from it. And Covid is at least primarily a respiratory disease. From a respiratory pandemic perspective, when we think about the existing morbidities and existing medical vulnerabilities of certain communities, we really can begin to get our hands around the disproportionate and expansive impacts of this health pandemic and the pandemic of structural racism, Farley says.
This heat dome is also setting up the perfect conditions for wildfires, which could pour smoke into cities in the western US in particulardry, hot air means super dry brush. Wildfire smoke deposits particulate matter in the lungs, leading to inflammation, even in healthy people. In one study done on mice, wildfire smoke decreased the antimicrobial activity of the cells that clear the lungs of harmful microbes. And the novel coronavirus is one seriously harmful microbe.
Put it all together and youve got a compounding threat to human health now unfolding across the US, particularly for low-income Americans: Covid-19 is wreaking economic devastation and trapping people indoors just as a weeks-long heat dome parks itself over the country. But this also might be an opportunity to better prepare these communities for life on an ever-hotter planet. The stimulus package following the 2008 economic collapse injected $5 billion into the Weatherization Assistance Program, started in 1976, which compensates homeowners to hire contractors to make improvements like better windows and insulation. By 2012, the revitalized program had weatherized a million houses."

In recent years, a big contagion focus has been on misinformation. I think financial crises as well have shaped, and probably will continue to shape, society. And then, of course, other forms of offline contagion, like violence. The aim of the book was to outline some fundamental ideas that can be useful for helping us tackle these different problemsand also show how we can learn from mistakes and things that have been overlooked in different fields. Often, if you're facing a particular form of contagion, another field might have already dealt with some of these exact situations. An example being the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused in large part by network structures that researchers on sexually transmitted diseases knew about 30 years earlier.
WIRED: You write about your summer working in finance at Canary Wharf in 2008, just when everything was tumbling down. It sounds like people had thought a lot about financial networks in terms of how you could profit from them, but not so much in terms of how they could fail. You write about how, similar to a person trying to avoid an STD, there were multiple forms of network exposure to worry about.
AK: I don't think, at that point, there was much thinking about how things were linked together. You could have banks, for example, that individually looked well diversified in their portfolios, but they may have all diversified in the same direction. So when an asset crashes, you've implicitly got a contagion effect, because all of them are exposed in the same way.
I think that's when people really began to understand the role of network effects, particularly some of these features where you had these large banks widely connected to create these hub effects, which meant that contagion spread far wider than it might have otherwise. During that period, you also saw a lot of hidden links being created, which meant there were all of these loops of contagion that no one really knew about. No one was quite sure exactly who owed what to whom. Which is one of the reasons why the system froze during that period, because people didn't know who to trust. It was, I guess, similar to a pandemic spreading through [an airline] flight network, where you've got many different routes through which cases can come. If you don't know what those links are, it's very hard to understand where the risk is.
WIRED: You left finance after that, but from what you can tell, has that perception changed? Do people have a better sense of those network structures now, having seen how they fail?
AK: There's been a lot of effort to understand this. But I think with any outbreak, understanding is the first step and doing something about it is the second. There were a lot of efforts by central banks to try to make changes that can improve resilience. So one is obviously things like capital requirements, particularly on banks that are structurally important to the network. But talking to people who work for central banks, as I wrote in the book, I think it is very clear that once you actually start changing the structure of the network, then that becomes much harder to persuade people to do.
So when you're talking, for example, within banks about ring fencing, which essentially cuts the links between the investment side and the retail side, that's something that people oppose far more strongly. So I think you can end up with a situation, unfortunately, as we often get with infectious diseases, where you can understand how contagion is happening, but actually implementing things that reduce those risky links may come in for a lot of opposition."

How can scientists tell if it’s successful while the world shifts around them?,https://www.wired.com/story/what-does-it-mean-to-say-a-new-drug-works/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f1217d4d91ebbe631df2dbf/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science-Remdesivir-1249103643.jpg",2020-07-20T11:00:00Z,"John Beigels problem was that not enough people were dying of Covid-19. Not that he wanted them to, of course. Its just that, as bad as the pandemic has gotten, it hasnt killed as many people as it seemed like it might. And Beigel, a researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was designing a big study to see if an experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir would work against the disease. He and his team needed the right end pointthe thing they could count, turn into data, and analyze. 
Mortality is a great end point. Its right there in the name.
But when we were thinking of end points, we thought a mortality study would need 3,000 or 4,000 people, says Beigel, associate director for clinical research in NIAIDs Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Those high numbers would give his team enough eventswhich is to say, deathsto get a statistically significant measurement of the drug at work. And they didnt have enough time to get that many people enrolled in their US study. We thought it was important to get the study done, to get a clinically meaningful end point, without taking the time we would need to do a mortality study, he says.
This was back in February, before anybody really knew anything about Covid-19. So Beigels team tried a different tack, one familiar to scientists and regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (which issued the Emergency Use Authorization under which people are studying the drug). Participants in the study would get scores, every day, calculated on whats called an ordinal scale. Healthy and released from the hospital, you get a score of 1. Dead, you get an 8. The other numbers were for everything in betweenlike whether the person has to get admitted to the hospital or needs oxygen or has to go on a mechanical ventilator.
Then they found another problem. When we first wrote the protocol, the end point chosen was ordinal score at day 15, Beigel says. That is something weve used for influenza studies before, so we knew the FDA would be OK with it, and is something that actually matters to the subject. Thats a good end point: Its not just a statistical entity. Its long enough to show an effect in many diseases, and it has clear clinical relevance.
In March we started hearing reports that the course of the disease might be much longer, and that there were people in the hospital for three weeks, up to four weeks, Beigel says. What happens if the recovery is much later than day 15? You might actually have a significant difference, yet you wouldnt show it.
So Beigels team changed their end point: ordinal score at day 28. They hadnt seen their data yet when they made the switch. That wouldve been an ethical no-no, chasing statistical significance by juking their methods. But juking ahead of data? Kosher, but they knew itd be controversial. It raised suspicion for our study, Beigel says. If this was something that is well known, like influenza, and we switched in the middle of the study, that would be really suspicious. For Covid, we havent seen anything like this.
In a study published in late May in The New England Journal of Medicine (and previewed during a press conference at the White House), the team concluded that patients taking remdesivir recovered in a median time of 11 days, while people given a placebo took a median of 15. It was enough to get remdesivir added to the US standard of care, prontothe first drug identified as having a beneficial effect on the new disease."

Modeling said folding gets a big boost from distributed computing efforts like the Folding@home global program, which employs even consumer computers as processing nodes to tackle big problems. Microsoft is testing pre-packed, shipping container-sized data centres that can be spun up on demand and run deep under the ocean’s surface fo sustainable, high-efficiency and cool operation to contribute to such efforts in a big way, and it’s now using one in Scotland to model viral proteins that lead to COVID-19.
This research project isn’t new for Microsoft it’s been operating the data center at a depth of 117 feet for two years now. But the shift of its focus to COVID-19 represents a new development, and is obviously a response to the imminent need for more advances around our understanding of the SARS-CoV-19 virus and potential therapies that we could use to treat or prevent it from infecting people.
Within the tubular submerged datacenter are 864 servers, providing significant computing power. The idea of packing them into a submersible tube is intended to provide efficiencies in terms of operating temperatures. Cooling and thermal management is essential for any high-capacity processing equipment, since all that computing power generates a tremendous amount of heat. It’s why you see such elaborate cooling equipment in high-performance gaming PC builds, and it’s doubly crucial when you’re operating at the level of the data center. Deep underwater, the thermal environment provides natural cooling that allows processors to run consistently at higher speeds, without the need to pump more energy in to run fans or more elaborate liquid cooling systems.
Should this project, which Microsoft has dubbed “Natick,” work as designed, future distributed computing projects could benefit immensely from the on-demand deployment of a number of these distributed sea-floor data centers."

Chemical industry leader 3M has partnered with MIT to create a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 that’s easy-to-use, and that can be manufactured cheaply and in large volume for mass distribution and use.
The test is currently the research phase, with a team led by MIT’s Professor Hadley Sikes of the school’s Department of Chemical Engineering. Sikes’ laboratory has a specific focus on creating and developing tech to enhance the performance of protein tests that are meant to provide rapid, accurate results.
3M is contributing its biomaterials and bioprocessing expertise, along with its experience in creating products designed to be manufactured at scale. The end goal is to create a test that detects viral antigens, a type of test first cleared for use in COVID-19 detection at the beginning of May by the FDA. These tests provide results much faster than the molecular PCR-based test but do have a higher change of fall negatives. Still, their ability to be administered at point-of-care, and return results within just minutes, could help considerably in ramping up testing efforts, especially in cases where individuals aren’t necessarily presenting symptoms but are in situations where they could pose a risk to others if carrying the virus while asymptomatic.
The new 3M and MIT projects is part of the RADx Tech program created by the National Institute of Health (NIH) specifically to fund the development of tests that can expand U.S. testing deployment. An initial $500,000 of funding was provided to MIT and 3M from the program, and it can potentially receive further funding after achieving other development milestones."

But a new wearable device from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory might actually be able to do the most to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and it’s not really all that technically advanced or complicated.
JPL’s PULSE wearable uses 3D-printed parts and readily available, affordable electronic components to do just one thing: remind a person not to touch their face. JPL’s designers claim that its simple enough that the gadget “can easily be reproduced by anyone regardless of their level of expertise,” and to encourage more people and companies to actually do that, the lab has made available a full list of parts, 3D modelling files and full instructions for its assembly via an open source license.
The PULSE is essentially a pendant, worn between six inches and 1 foot from the head around the neck, which can detect when a person’s hand is approaching their face using gan IR-based proximity sensor. A vibration motor then shakes out an alert, and the response becomes stronger as your hand gets closer to your face.
The hardware itself is simple but that’s the point. It’s designed to run on readily available 3V coin batteries, and if you have a 3D printer to hand for the case and access to Amazon, you can probably put one together yourself at home in no time.
The goal of PULSE obviously isn’t to single-handedly eliminate COVID-19 contact transmission from contaminated hands to a person’s mouth, nose or eyes is just one vector, and it seems likely that respiratory droplets that result in airborne transmission is at least as effective at passing’s the virus around. But just like regular mask-wearing can dramatically reduce transmission risk, minimizing how often you touch your face can have a big combinatory effect with other measures taken to reduce the spread.
Other health wearables might actually be able to tell you when you have COVID-19 before you show significant symptoms or have a positive test result but work still needs to be done to understand how well that works, and how it could be used to limit exposure. JPL’s Pulse has the advantage of being effective now in terms of building positive habits that we know will limit the spread of COVID-19, as well as other viral infections."

Most agree that the decision to return to the office should involve a combination of business, government and medical officials and scientists who have a deep understanding of COVID-19 and infectious disease in general. The exact timing will depend on many factors, including the government’s willingness to open up, the experts’ view of current conditions, business leadership’s tolerance for risk (or how reasonable it is to run the business remotely), where your business happens to be and the current conditions there.
That doesn’t mean every business that can open will, but if and when they get a green light, they can at least begin bringing some percentage of employees back. But what that could look like is clouded in great uncertainty around commutes, office population density and distancing, the use of elevators, how much you can reasonably deep clean, what it could mean to have a mask on for eight hours a day, and many other factors.
To get a sense of how tech companies are looking at this, we spoke to a number of executives to get their perspective. Most couldn’t see returning to the office beyond a small percentage of employees this year. But to get a more complete picture, we also spoke to a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a government official to get their perspectives on the matter.
While there are some guidelines out there to help companies, most of the executives we spoke to found that while they missed in-person interactions, they were happy to take things slow and were more worried about putting staff at risk than being in a hurry to return to normal operations.
Iman Abuzeid, CEO and co-founder at Incredible Health, a startup that helps hospitals find and hire nurses, said her company was half-remote even before COVID-19 hit, but since then, the team is now completely remote. Whenever San Francisco’s mayor gives the go-ahead, she says she will reopen the office, but the company’s 30 employees will have the option to keep working remotely.
She points out that for some employees, working at home has proven very challenging. “I do want to highlight two groups that are pretty important that need to be highlighted in this narrative. First, we have employees with very young kids, and the schools are closed so working at home forever or even for the rest of this year is not really an option, and then the second group is employees who are in smaller apartments, and they’ve got roommates and it’s not comfortable to work at home,” Abuzeid explained.
Those folks will need to go to the office whenever that’s allowed, she said. For Lindsay Grenawalt, chief people officer at Cockroach Labs, an 80-person database startup in NYC, said there has to be a highly compelling reason to bring people back to the office at this point."

The study will help the company figure out if it can successfully develop an algorithm to accurately detect a COVID-19 infection before the onset of systems. In order to gather the data needed to see if they can do this, Fitbit is asking users in either the U.S. or Canada who have either had or currently have a confirmed case of COVID-19, or flu-like symptoms that might be an indicator of an undiagnosed case, to answer some questions in order to contribute to its research.
The answer to these questions from participants will be paired with data gathered via their Fitbit to help identify any patterns that could potentially provide an early warning about someone falling ill. Pre-symptomatic detection could have a number of benefits, mostly obviously in ensuring that an individual is then able to self-isolate more quickly and prevent them from infecting others.
Early detection could also have advantages in terms of treatment, allowing health practitioners to intervene earlier and potentially prevent the worst of the symptoms of the infection. Depending on what treatments ultimately emerge, early detection could have a big impact on their efficacy.
Fitbit is asking those who would take part in the study to answer questions about whether or not they have or have expressed COVID-19 or flu, its symptoms, as well as other demographic and medical history info. Participation in the study is voluntary, in case you’re not comfortable sharing that info, and once in, participants can decided to withdraw whenever they want.
COVID-19 early detection could be a big help in any safe, actually practical return-to-work strategy for reopening the economy. It could also serve as a means of expanding diagnosis in combination with testing, depending on how accurate it’s found to be across these studies, and with what devices. A confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis doesn’t actually have to mean a test result; it could be a physician’s assessment based on a number of factors, including biometric data nd symptom expression. Depending on what a comprehensive mitigation strategy ends up looking like, that could play a much bigger role in assessing the scale and spread of COVID-19 in future, especially as we learn more about it."

The waves of startup layoffs in the COVID-19 era hit companies large and small, impacting even the richest, most recently-funded companies. It was a swift correction to staffing in an industry that had enjoyed a decade-long bull market and record private financing totals. Looking back, the pivot to fear appears brisk.
The market for startup talent have since improved, to a degree.
This morning, we’ll look at the pace and scale of startup layoffs, leaning on data provided to TechCrunch by Layoffs.FYI. We’ll also rope in information from a global startup survey executed by Paris’s Station F to better parse where the impacts have been starkest.
According to data from Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts in the startup industry, the number of people laid off stayed aloft from March to April and into the first weeks of May. In contrast, the total number of companies cutting staff declined from early April through the end of May; fewer companies cut staff as time went along, then, but it appears that they made larger cuts.

Now, thanks to the COVID-19 epidemic everyone wants the company’s technology to track building and room occupancy and use.
It’s one reason why the company managed to raise $51 million in a new round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from previous investors like Dick Costolo’s 01 Advisors and the Los Angeles-based investment firm, Upfront Ventures.
“The primary driver [for demand] has been being able to reopen buildings safely and to do so without invading privacy,” says Density chief executive Andrew Farah.
And while the company started out as a service for data-loving tech companies, retail stores and coffee chains, it’s now become a ubiquitous technology for needed for every business with shared space, said Farah. That means fulfillment centers, grocery stores, warehouses, meat processing plants, in addition to something like TechCrunch headquarters.
What will the company do with all that money? Spend it on sales, marketing, and actually getting the tech into customers’ buildings, according to Farah.
“A lot of what we’re going to invest in is customer success, core infrastructure and growing our product and sales,” said Farah. “The first time our customers hear about us is when they get on a demo for a sales call.”
New orders for the company’s hardware and software service are pouring in, he said. And these order range from $20,000 to $50,000 pilot projects to seven-figure, thousand-unit initial deployments. “All of our customers end up tripling in size from their initial land,” he said. Density charges a one-time fee of $895 for installation of its sensors and another $800 per-sensor per-year for access to the data. 
Density works through both channel partners and direct sales, according to Farah, and the urgency of its potential customers has led to the massive uptick in funding.
“A lot of customers are trying to solve a problem that they had last week. There’s a sense of urgency from real estate and safety teams that we haven’t seen before,” said Farah.
Behind all of this is the demand from employees for safe, socially distanced public workspaces as the country continues to battle the COVID-19 epidemic that continues to ravage the U.S.
And while COVID-19 may be today’s main selling point, investors like Upfront Ventures’ Mark Suster saw the value in Density’s technology much earlier. “The investment thesis for me combines my belief in computer vision as a next-gen I/O (3) along with my thesis that The Innovators Dilemma or Deflationary Economics drive all of the largest success on the Internet (4). Todays people tracking solutions are hugely expensive and mostly used in retail environments,” Suster wrote in a blog post announcing Upfront’s initial investment in the company, back in 2016. “The costs have greatly limited adoption and we think thats about to change in a massive way.”

At Kleiner Perkins, the latest firm to back Density’s computer vision-based technology, the investment was a year-long process.
“I had heard through the grapevine that they were going to talk to investors,” said Ilya Fushman, a new director at the company and one of Kleiner Perkins’ partners, who had first begun speaking with Farah about a year ago.
Fushman said that Kleiner was interested in the real estate market and its commitment to Density falls in line with another recent investment in Proxy, a startup providing cardless and fobless building access controls.
“If you look for market sizing, which we do, there are few markets that are as big as real estate,” Fushman said. “It’s also a market that’s historically been under-penetrated by technology. A lot of building management is done on pen and paper when it comes to space utilization.”
Both access control and utilization have been areas that more companies need to get a handle on thanks to the COVID-19 epidemic, which made backing a company like Density a natural fit, he said."

The control, part of the NYSEs automatic provisions to pause trading, has been put to the test since markets first began realizing the extent of the economic damage a worsening COVID-19 outbreak could cause in the U.S.
The NYSE’s circuit-breaker system was implemented after the Black Monday stock crash of 1987, when major exchanges fell 20% in one day.
As the economic fallout from a widening COVID-19 outbreak manifests, it may challenge the digital contingency provisions of America’s largest stock exchange.
TechCrunch received some background on the circuit-breaker system from the NYSE.
“The equities and options exchanges have procedures for coordinated cross-market trading halts if a severe market price decline reaches levels that may exhaust market liquidity,” a spokesperson said.
The NYSE has three circuit-breaker thresholds that switch on based on a decline in index value: a Level 1 (for a 7% drop), Level 2 (at 13%) and Level 3 (20%), per info provided to TechCrunch by the NYSE.
A Level 1 or Level 2 decline shuts down the market for a minimum of 15 minutes; a Level 3 circuit-breaker suspends NYSE activity for the remainder of the trading-day, according to the exchange.
After President Trump announced a U.S.-Europe travel-ban Wednesday evening, the Dow fell 2100 points shortly after opening Thursday, activating the NYSE’s Level-1 control, to halt a rapid value drop in stocks.
The market-wide circuit breaker triggered this morning operated exactly as designed, giving investors additional time to absorb information and understand whats happening in the market,” an NYSE spokesperson told TechCrunch.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 which track the performance of major stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ have plummeted, losing over 20% in value since the virus began to the spread in the U.S.
By mid-day Thursday, the Dow was on track for its sixth-worst decline in history.
Market volatility around COVID-19 which originated in China and has spread to Europe and the U.S. will test the NYSE’s contingency plans for a sustained market selloff.
While there’s been some chatter about America’s largest stock exchange shutting down completely which hasn’t happened since the September 11 attacks there are no plans to close at the moment.
The NYSE is carefully monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and has robust contingency plans, tested regularly, to enable continuous operation of the NYSE exchanges should any facilities be impacted, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
In a memo obtained by Reuters, the NYSE’s Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund noted the exchange had limited visitors and closed some public-facilities within its 11 Wall Street structure.
The NYSE also shared a contingency memo with TechCrunch describing business continuity plans for the stock market, and its big digital-board, to operate trading remotely if there is a personnel shutdown of the main-floor."

The company, which launched in 2015, says it faced a fundraising round that collapsed two weeks ago and was in the middle of an acquisition that collapsed on Friday. It cites the current economic downturn and COVID-19 as the reason for both of these events.
Service will shut down later this week, on Friday, March 20. It’ll try to refund subscribers (pending its cash position), route all pending claims directly to existing users and delete all personal information from its customers within the next 30 days.
It’s worth noting that Service founder and CEO Michael Schneider also notes that since it was founded, the company never turned a profit, even though it recovered over $4,000,000 for its customers.
“Despite partnerships with major brands such as KAYAK and Microsoft, we have never turned a profit, despite a focus on revenue growth and cost cutting through software automation,” Schneider writes. “We were in the middle of a fundraise when it collapsed two weeks ago, and then we were in the middle of an acquisition that collapsed last Friday due to everything going on with COVID-19 and the economy.”
With the current downturn in travel, we’ll likely see more travel startups collapse. Margins are notoriously low in this business and a lot of companies depend on what is essentially affiliate marketing revenue. Since the travel industry is currently in a tailspin, that source of revenue is quickly dwindling for this class of startups.
Service had raised a total of $5.1 million since it was founded. Investors include Founders Fund, which led its seed round, as well as Menlo Ventures, Maveron, Xfund, Flight Ventures and others. The company last raised a convertible note last September.
“I remain proud of what we accomplished over the last nearly five years, and Im grateful to our investors, employees, and customers for all their support. While I regret not succeeding in building a sustainable long term business, I am proud that we tried, and that we made people’s lives a bit easier around customer service,” writes Schneider."

The results of this survey, which should be available within four to six weeks, will help shape local policy decisions.
The survey seeks to understand how COVID-19 has impacted the number of gig jobs available, pay, and companies’ stances on health insurance and paid sick leave. It also asks what workers feel they most urgently need, whether it’s access to protective equipment or emergency funds, as well as if workers are likely to work while sick due to their financial situation.
Conducted by the city’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) and led by UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner, the study is targeting at least 500 gig workers who perform services for 12 of the most popular platforms: Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Caviar, Uber Eats, Postmates, GrubHub, Instacart, Shipt, Saucey, Amazon Flex and Drizly.
“This is a very critical workforce for a number a reasons,” Benner told TechCrunch. “They are particularly vulnerable and susceptible, especially early on with drivers taking people to and from the airport. But now as we’re potentially seeing a spike in the online ordering of groceries and food delivery, these people doing the deliveries are providing essential services during this time of having to shelter in home and are potentially vulnerable. And if they’re not being careful in handling food and groceries, they could potentially be spreading [COVID-19].”
This survey comes after Benner was tasked with leading a broader survey about gig workers in San Francisco. That survey kicked off last September but is currently on hold as Benner and his team focus more on the COVID-19 survey. Still, they are analyzing the 700 responses from that initial survey.
“What we know from other sources and what our survey will likely confirm is it’s a large immigrant workforce,’ Benner said. “It’s a lot of people working on low wages and many hours and many people do this work full-time.”
Outside of this survey, the city has begun taking steps to advocate for this essential workforce. Yesterday, SF’s Board of Supervisors pushed for more gig worker protections, asking the SF Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, for example, to establish enforcement procedures in compliance with Assembly Bill 5. AB 5 is the new California law that outlines what types of workers can be legally classified as independent contractors.
This board of supervisor’s resolution, which Gig Workers Rising and We Drive Progress advocated for the board of supervisors to adopt, came after Gig Workers Rising urged California lawmakers to enforce AB 5. Earlier this month, Gig Workers Rising sent a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials asking them to step in and protect workers during this pandemic.
In the meantime, workers interested in filling out the survey can do so here."

Zillow said it decided to pause making offers to sellers after several counties and states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio, New York and Nevada, implemented emergency orders requiring people to stay home and all non-essential business activities, including some real-estate related activities, to stop.
Zillow follows action from other real estate startups such as Opendoor and Redfin to temporarily pause making offers on homes.
“We plan to restore Zillow Offers full operations once health concerns pass and local health orders are lifted,” Zillow Group CEO and co-founder Rich Barton said in a statement. “In the meantime, we are working to support our customers and partners in these uncertain times when home has never been more important.”
The company started to slow its pace of buying homes last month, while accelerating sales in the quarter, Barton said. Zillow’s inventory is now 1,860 homes, a 31% decline from 2,707 homes at the end of 2019.
The company said it will continue to market and sell homes through “Zillow Offers,” and will temporarily suspend plans to open additional Zillow Offers markets. Zillow also halted open houses in all markets, beginning last week.
We have a strong balance sheet and cash position, and are taking proactive steps to reduce spending to offset the important financial support we’re giving our industry partners so we may continue to best serve our mutual customers,” added Barton."

A spokeswoman for the parliament confirmed today that an “alternative electronic voting procedure” has been agree for the plenary session that will take place on March 26.
“This voting procedure is temporary and valid until 31 July,” she added.
Earlier this month the parliament moved the majority of its staff to teleworking. MEPs have since switch to full remote work as confirmed cases of COVID-19 have continued to step up across Europe. Though how to handle voting remotely has generated some debate in and of itself.
“Based on public health grounds, the President decided to have a temporary derogation to enable the vote to take place by an alternative electronic voting procedure, with adequate safeguards to ensure that Members votes are individual, personal and free, in line with the provisions of the Electoral act and the Members Statute,” the EU parliament spokeswoman said today, when we asked for the latest on its process for voting during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The current precautionary measures adopted by the European Parliament to contain the spread of COVID-19 dont affect legislative priorities. Core activities are reduced, but maintained precisely to ensure legislative, budgetary, scrutiny functions,” she added.
The spokeswoman confirmed votes will take place via email — explaining the process as follows: “Members would receive electronically, via email to their official email address, a ballot form, which would be returned, completed, from their email address to the relevant Parliaments functional mailbox.”
“The results of all votes conducted under this temporary derogation would be recorded in the minutes of the sitting concerned,” she further noted.
Last week, ahead of the parliament confirming the alternative voting process, German Pirate Party MEP, Patrick Breyer, raised concerns about the security of e-voting — arguing that what was then just a proposal for MEPs to fill and sign a voting list, scan it and send it via email to the administration risked votes being vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.
“Such a manipulation-prone procedure risks undermining public trust in the integrity of Parliament votes that can have serious consequences,” he wrote. “The procedure comes with a risk of manipulation by hackers. Usually MEPs can send emails using several devices, and their staff can access their mailbox, too. Also it is easy to come by a MEP’s signature and scan it… This procedure also comes with the risk that personally elected and highly paid MEPs could knowingly allow others to vote on their behalf.”
“eVoting via the public Internet is inherently unsafe and prone to hacking, thus risks to erode public trust in European democracy,” he added. “I am sure powerful groups such as the Russian intelligence agency have a great interest in manipulating tight votes. eVoting makes manipulation at a large scale possible.”
Breyer suggested a number of alternatives — such as parallel postal voting, to have a paper back-up of MEPs’ e-votes; presence voting in EP offices in Member States (though clearly that would require parliamentarians to risk exposing themselves and others to the virus by traveling to offices in person); and a system such as “Video Ident”, which he noted is already used in Germany, where the MEP face identify in front of a webcam in a live video stream and then show their voting sheets to the camera.
He also suggested MEPs might not notice manipulations even if voting results were published — as looks to be the case with the parliament’s agreed procedure.
It’s not clear whether the parliament is applying a further back-up step — such as requiring a paper ballot to be mailed in parallel to an email vote. The parliament spokeswoman declined to comment in any detail when we asked. “All measures have been put in place to ensure the vote runs smoothly,” she said, adding: “We never comment on security measures.”
Reached for his response, Breyer told us: “My concerns definitely stand.”
However security expert J. Alex Halderman, a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan — who testified before the US Senate hearing into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Election — said e-voting where the results are public is relatively low risk provided MEPs check their votes have been recorded properly.
“Voting isn’t such a hard problem when it’s not a secret ballot, and I take it that how each MEP votes is normally public. As long as that’s the case, I don’t think this is a major security issue,” he told TechCrunch. “MEPs should be encouraged to check that their votes are correctly recorded in the minutes and to raise alarms if there’s any discrepancy, but that’s probably enough of a safeguard during these challenging times.”  
“All of this is in stark contrast to election for public office, which are conducted with a secret ballot and in which there’s normally no possibility for voters to verify that their votes are correctly recorded,” he added. 
In further news related to the EU parliament the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) announced today that it’s closed an investigation into the former’s user of the US-based political campaign group, NationBuilder last year.
Back in November the EU’s lead data regulator revealed it had issued its first ever sanction of an EU institution by taking enforcement action over the parliament’s contract with NationBuilder for a public engagement campaign to promote voting in the spring election.
During the campaign the website collected personal data from more than 329,000 people, which was processed on behalf of the Parliament by NationBuilder. The EDPS found the parliament had contravened regulations governing how EU institutions can use personal data related to the selection and approval of sub-processors used by NationBuilder.
The contract has been described as coming to “a natural end” in July 2019, and the EDPS said today that all data collected has been transferred to the European Parliaments servers’.
No further sanctions have been implemented, though the regulator said it will continue to monitor the parliament’s activities closely.
Data protection plays a fundamental role in ensuring electoral integrity and must therefore be treated as a priority in the planning of any election campaign,” said EDPS, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, in a statement today. “With this in mind, the EDPS will continue to monitor the Parliaments activities closely, in particular those relating to the 2024 EU parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, I am confident that the improved cooperation and understanding that now exists between the EDPS and the Parliament will help the Parliament to learn from its mistakes and make more informed decisions on data protection in the future, ensuring that the interests of all those living in the EU are adequately protected when their personal data is processed.
At the time of writing the parliament had not responded to a request for comment."

Although groceries via Order Pickup and Drive Up would be valuable services at a time when people are being asked to distance themselves from others to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, Target says it won’t have time to train employees on these new processes right now.
Like many retailers and grocers, Target is impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which is significantly changing the way people shop. People are more likely to buy in bulk to minimize trips to the store. And many are panic-buying critical supplies, like toilet paper. Target says it’s seen a sustained surge in both traffic and sales, particularly in food and beverage and other household essentials, like cleaning supplies and baby products. Other categories, including apparel and accessories, have slowed.
The launch of any new system or process takes time to adjust to, even when there’s ample time to train. But Target staff today is working at increased levels — its March sales are 20% higher than March of last year, as a  point of comparison.
Like everywhere, Target also faces staffing concerns as people scramble to figure out childcare when schools are closed. It will have to reassess employee schedules on the fly, as staff leaves unexpectedly when they or a family member gets sick. There have also been a small number of cases where Target employees themselves have testedpositive for the virus. And as the outbreak spreads, more will likely be exposed, given their continual contact with the public.
To address these concerns, Target is cleaning its stores regularly, promoting social distancing, wiping down carts, adding signage to guide guests, cleaning checklanes after each transaction, and more. It’s also stopping in-store returns for three weeks, but will honor later returns when the ban is lifted, as a result. And it’s pausing its small-format store openings and remodels planned for this year — shifting those to 2021, given the chaos around its business today.
To assist employees, Target announced that it’s investing more than $300 million in added wages, a new paid leave program, bonus payouts and relief fund contributions.
Though Target won’t roll out curbside fresh grocery pickup now, it continues to operate the grocery delivery business Shipt. This and other grocery delivery services are booming due to the outbreak. Instacart this week said it was hiring 300,000 more full-service shoppers due to coronavirus. Walmart, CVS, Amazon, and other U.S. employers are hiring more than 800,000 new workers due to the COVID-19 impacts."

Yelp’s initial announcement was a little vague about who the “participating” businesses would be, and TechCrunch mistakenly wrote about it as if business owners would have to sign up to participate.
Turns out that the fundraising campaigns appeared automatically with company profiles on Yelp. To get out of running the campaigns, Yelp and GoFundMe required more identification from business owners (for example drivers’ licenses or business ID verifications). One estimate put the number of fundraisers that had been created through the program at 144,000.
After a lot of pushback on social media (and likely directly to Yelp and GoFundMe as well), Yelp said the two companies are now working together to create a “seamless” approach where businesses have to opt-in, rather than being signed yelp automatically and to opt in to use it in the first place.
The lesson here is that while the Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a major impact on local retailers and other businesses that have been forced to close, or have lost business, due to shelter-in-place and other social distancing measures, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every business want to fundraise to offset their own specific predicaments.
And if they do, ultimately it’s their own choice about which companies they want to work with.
The original fundraising feature was launched by Yelp earlier this week as part of a bigger effort from both companies to provide assistance to businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. (Yelp has also committed $25 million in waived fees for those who usually pay it for premium listing services; while GoFundMe is also working with other companies like Intuit QuickBooks to build fundraisers for its business customers.)
It was only yesterday, however, that outcry began to emerge over how that integration was actually put in place, and how hard it was to remove, both for small businesses and for those that are part of larger chains.
At a time when we are seeing a huge groundswell of good works and charity to help our communities get through what is not just a public health crisis, but a social and economic one, the resulting rollout made the effort feel more a bit opportunistic than altruistic both GoFundMe and Yelp are businesses, after all. (It’s worth noting that there have been positiveresponses as well.)
Andy McMillan, owner of the alcohol-free Portland bar Suckerpunch, was the first to attract widespread attention to the issue. In a statement, he said the core idea was good, but the implementation was not:
What if running a fundraiser, for example . invalidated criteria on their insurance to be able to make a claim who knows? What if it invalidated them being able to reach out for city level or county level or state level or federal level financial support for the business?
This could have an incredible like, real detrimental impact to small businesses a thing that a bunch of tech bros sitting in a room thought was a good idea … There’s a version of this where they could have emailed everyone and done a one-click sign-up, and that would have been actually probably appreciated by most people, but at least would have been consensual and would have been thoughtful.
We’re still waiting to hear back from GoFundMe, but Yelp’s full statement is below:
On Tuesday, Yelp announced a partnership with GoFundMe to provide a fast and easy way for people to support their favorite local businesses by donating to a GoFundMe fundraiser directly on the Yelp pages of eligible businesses. In an effort to get businesses help quickly and easily, a GoFundMe fundraiser was automatically added to the Yelp pages of an initial group of eligible businesses, with information provided on how to claim it or opt out should a business choose to do so. However, it has come to our attention that some businesses did not receive a notification with opt-out instructions, and some would have preferred to actively opt-in to the program. As such, we have paused the automatic rollout of this feature, and are working with GoFundMe to provide a seamless way for businesses to opt into the program moving forward, as we have received a great deal of interest and support for the program from both consumers and businesses alike."

Why this population (deemed high-risk to the coronavirus) isn’t yet doing legislative business remotely comes down to process, tech and political will.
“The House rules and the Senate rules require voting in person. And it would require a change in those rules to do that,” California Congressman Eric Swalwell told TechCrunch on a call from his Washington, D.C., office.
Swalwell has a plan for Congress to work away from the Hill. He recently reintroduced a resolution with Arkansas Representative Rick Crawford (R-AZ) that would allow members to participate virtually in hearings and vote remotely, under special circumstances.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to have nixed that option, at least for the near-term, reportedly telling her caucus last week, “We are the captains of the ship. We are last to leave.”
A priority for Congress is finalizing emergency COVID-19 legislation to provide trillions of dollars in resources to combat the virus and stem the economic havoc it’s wreaking across the U.S.
Without a rule-change and clear plan for members to legislate and vote outside from Capitol Hill, passing that legislation requires lawmakers be present on the building’s floor.

There are mixed messages on who makes the call for Congress to go to a remote-work scenario and what kind of digital contingency would kick in to perform legislative duties at a distance. 
In a subsequent scrum to her “last to leave” comments, Pelosi gave an unequivocal “no” to reporters’ questions on Congress closing due to COVID-19. But she added, the ultimate call was not hers. “That’s a health and security decision up to the Capitol physician [and] Sergeant at Arms,” the Speaker said.
TechCrunch sought input on the matter from the House Office of the Sergeant at Arms. That inquiry referred us to the Chief Administrative Office, which has not yet responded.
Even after the first congressional staffers have tested positive for COVID-19, the majority of Capitol Hill’s high-risk members continue to work on-site and in their office buildings.
Representative Swalwell’s MOBILE (Members Operating to Be Innovative and Link Everyone) resolution proposes to change that.
Hes introduced the measure every year since 2013, but believes it carries extra weight now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Swalwell reintroduced it again on March 9.
MOBILE would “mandate the development of a secure remote voting system which members could use to vote remotely on suspension bills, generally non-controversial bills that require a two-thirds vote to pass,” according to a statement on the resolution provided by Swalwell’s office.
“It’s bi-partisan, introduced by me and Representative Rick Crawford from Arkansas and we’ve had dozens of members join us in support,” Swalwell told TechCrunch.
“I don’t mean to have this substitute us meeting in person,” the California Democrat said. But Swalwell believes there needs to be tech provisions in Congress, comparable to contingency plans in the private sector, for members to operate virtually outside of Capitol Hill.
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin echoed this on Tuesday, underscoring the need for virtual committee hearings and the ability to vote away from Congress in times of national emergency.
As millions of Americans shift from physical work spaces to platforms such as Zoom, Slack or Google Hangouts during the COVID-19 crisis, detail is lacking on the software, apps and security for Congress to operate under a measure such as MOBILE.
There’s still little in the way of tech in the voting process on Capitol Hill, where the Senate still makes decisions by recording verbal “Yeas” and “Nays” on a tally sheet.
“I’m not offering myself as the technical expert,” Swalwell said on the implementation of his suggested remote voting and convening resolution.
He explained that the House Administration Committee and House Rules Committee would be the subject matter experts to determine how the Congress would secure voting and meetings remotely.

“We have smart members on those committees and capable staffers who could give us a tech solution today…and the solution that we ultimately use down the road,” he said.
While the business of Congress still remains a present and in-person affair, the body is taking cautionary measures to protect staff. This week several members, including representative Swalwell and West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, instructed employees to work from home.
There’s more capability for congressional staff, compared to members, to work remotely, according to Frederick Hill, a Managing Director at FTI Consulting who spent 17 years as a staffer in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
“The technology is in place to support much of the work that goes on in the background at the staff level,” Hill told TechCrunch.
“They have VPN networks, shared drives for off-site work, devices and smartphones to keep them in contact and help draft legislation.” The September 11 attacks and 2001 Anthrax attacks forced a number of these contingencies for congressional staff members.
Hill explained that when it comes to the most official congressional activity, such as voting on the floor, “there really are no provisions [currently] to use technology.”
Part of that has to do with ensuring those elected to represent constituencies are genuinely present to vote.
But similar to so many previously in-person functions that have shifted to apps paired with security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, decision-making on Capitol Hill could also move to remote and digital options.
An extenuating circumstance, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could be what finally moves America’s chief legislating body in the direction of being able to vote remotely.
“It certainly has provoked the conversation,” Swalwell said. “I think it is a needed conversation. I wish it were under different circumstances.”"

Airbnb’s recent moves in the wake of a global travel slowdown are interesting and worth understanding in chronological order. What it details is a company spending heavily today to keep up its future health. Demand will return to the world travel market in time — how much, no one knows — and Airbnb wants to be a well-liked participant in the return to form.
Building off our last look at the company, we should understand how Airbnb intends to not only survive, but come out the other side of the pandemic with enough user trust to get back to work"

Ive been infected with the novel coronavirus for at least three weeks.
It started with my partner coughing and feeling very tired. A couple of days later, I started showing the same symptoms.
As a medical professional, he was required to get tested and I followed suit within days. We both tested positive and have been recovering at home since.
The symptoms have been up and down over the past two weeks. After the first few days, the mild cough gave way to an unrelenting one and the feeling of being tired gave way to being completely drained at all hours. My partner completely lost his sense of smell.
A week into having COVID-19, we thought wed turned a corner, only for more symptoms to manifest. The virus had made its way to my GI tract, adding nausea and an inability to keep my head up without throwing up. Today, two weeks after the first bouts of coughing, we both feel significantly better, but continue to self-isolate as instructed.
Luckily for both of us, we have now been symptom-free for 72 hours, and the symptoms we did have were relatively mild throughout. The experience of getting tested mandated for my partner to be able to go back to working at the hospital could not have been easier. I showed up at the hospital and was greeted by a doctor and two nurses. They took a sample and advised me on how best to self-isolate for the next few weeks. The whole thing took less than 15 minutes, and it was only 24 hours later that I got the call confirming that I had tested positive.
My employer has been supportive throughout. Theyve connected me to support services, offered a number of leave options if I were to take time off to deal with the virus, constantly checked in on my prognosis and even sent a work-from-home toolkit complete with a giant monitor, keyboard and mouse. Throughout the self-isolation period, I have been able to work from home a relatively seamless transition given that my job has long enabled me to work from home when needed. If I needed further healthcare, I can count on the many telehealth options available through my insurance.
What all this cemented is how incredibly fortunate I am, unlike the millions of Americans now losing their jobs. While others have been unable to get tested, my entire testing experience was painless. I have the luxury of being able to work from home. Im quarantined with my partner and my puppy, so I havent gotten lonely. Because Im still getting my paycheck, I dont have to worry about making the next rent payment. Im able to have grocery and takeout deliveries left at my doorstep. If I were to take a turn for the worse, a major hospital is just down the street.
This epidemic has laid bare the incredible differences in privilege within our society, including within tech. Long celebrated as representing the future of work, today thousands of gig workers have lost their main source of income, with no paycheck to count on and no option to work from home. Others, from delivery to warehouse workers, have no choice but to work, even at increased risk of contracting the disease themselves. Thousands in the Bay Area who live alone now risk being completely socially isolated as we continue to be on lockdown, while others with kids and large families now worry about taking care of their children while also working full-time jobs.
Not to mention that the homeless of our cities have no way to self-isolate even if they wanted to. Crowded homeless shelters to the extent they were available are no longer an option.
This is a moment where all of us in tech have to come together to help even the scales. Thousands of tech workers are already donating their time and resources, but more can be done:
<ul><li>Now is the time to max out our employee match programs to make every dollar we give count more.</li><li>Donations are needed by Frontline Foods, an effort that started in the Bay Area to provide front-line workers with food and is now scaling globally. More generally food banks are seeing an exponential rise in the demand for their services, with Second Harvest being one to flag in the Bay Area.</li><li>If you know a co-worker with kids, offer to babysit over video for an hour or two. This can be as simple as playing a game on Houseparty together if theyre 12 or older, or helping them with a lesson their parents have found particularly hard to get through.</li><li>A lot of us are anxious about getting the virus, so you can only imagine how the elderly and those with underlying health conditions feel. Give your grandparent a call, or donate your time and resources to organizations like Meals on Wheelsto make sure theyre getting the nutrition they need to get through this.</li><li>Many local businesses may close because of the pandemic. Support them by ordering takeout and other delivery services. If you prefer to donate directly, many cities have created funds to provide relief to impacted small businesses, like the Silicon Valley Strong Fund in San Jose.</li></ul>For the foreseeable future, my only visits to the outside world will be with mask and gloves on to walk my dog around the corner. Ill have plenty of time to reflect on how lucky I am, and the privilege guilt will follow. Im guessing Im not alone. Lets channel our guilt into something good.
