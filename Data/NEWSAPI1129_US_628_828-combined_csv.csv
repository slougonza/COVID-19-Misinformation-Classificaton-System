A person in Washington state died after contracting the novel coronavirus, health authorities announced on Saturday. It is the first death attributed to the virus in the U.S.
We are dealing with an emergency evolving situation, Amy Reynolds, of the Washington state health department, told the Associated Press. A spokesperson for EvergreenHealth Medical Center in King County, Washington confirmed to the AP that the patient died there, but gave no other details.
It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. 
We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.

It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends, Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, said in a statement. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.
The news of the death comes one day after three new cases of coronavirus with unknown origin were reported in the United States. Before this week, the only confirmed cases of the virus in the country originated after a person traveled to an area of the world hard-hit by the disease, or developed after a person had close contact with a confirmed case. Cases with unknown origins are alarming to health authorities because their presence indicates that the disease is likely circulating within the population. 
The virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has spread to 57 countries around the world since it emerged in China in December. The respiratory disease has infected more than 85,000 people and killed more than 2,900. In the United States, 66 people with COVID-19 have been identified.
The healthcare industry is bracing for the virus. In California, 124 nurses and other healthcare workers at UC Davis Hospital, have been told to quarantine themselves at home, a healthcare union said on Friday. They are believed to have been exposed to the virus at the hospital where one coronavirus patient sought treatment.

Attempts to contain and mitigate the spread of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 are wreaking havoc on travel plans around the globe, and the annual Game Developers Conference is no exception. The majority of major sponsors for GDC 2020 in San Francisco have already pulled out a little more than two weeks ahead of the event's scheduled March 16 start. As of publication time, however, the event is still on, which raises the question: what would it take to make the GDC cancel?
On February 28 (Friday), GDC posted an update saying, ""We are closely monitoring the COVID19 (coronavirus) situation and want to assure everyone that your health and safety are a top priority. If our assessment of the situation changes, based on new and evolving developments or updated information, we will promptly update this statement regarding the status of GDC 2020 accordingly."" 
Sony and Facebook both backed out on February 20, the first of the dominoes to fall. Since then, other cancellations have followed rapidly. EA and Kojima Productions both backed out on February 24, then Unity, Microsoft, Epic Games (and Unreal Engine) bowed out on February 27, with Amazon and Activision/Blizzard following on February 28.
Most of those companies are not only major presenters and presences at the conference, they're also major sponsors. While the companies that have backed out represent only a small fraction of the total planned exhibitors, they occupy an outsize amount of space at the showextremely literally. A map of the show floor, where the scheduled booth space of companies that have cancelled is blacked out, looks dire:
Enlarge/ There be absolutely no digital dragons here, because the companies that render them aren't coming. (As of 3:00pm Eastern, Friday Feb. 28.)
GDC is not the first event to have to make the go/no-go call in the face of COVID-19, and it will not be the last. The world's biggest telecom show, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Spain, was cancelled earlier this month after vendors backed out. The Geneva Motor Show was also cancelled after Switzerland put a temporary ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Nor are smaller gatherings immune: The Eve Online fanfest, scheduled for April in Reykjavik, has also been cancelled, as has Facebook's own F8 developer conference, which would have started May 5."

With the dizzying international spread of the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization Friday announced that the global threat of COVID-19 has increased. The risk of spread and risk of impact has now risen from high to very high on a global scale, according to the organizations latest assessments.
Between Thursday and Friday, five additional countries identified their first casesBelarus, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Nigeriaand large outbreaks in Italy (888 cases) and Iran (388 cases) continue to export cases. So far, at least 24 cases in 14 countries link back to Italy and at least 97 cases in 11 countries link back to Iran, WHO reported Friday.
Worldwide, there are more than 85,400 cases and 2,924 deaths, with 53 countries reporting cases in addition to China, as of Saturday morning. While China still has over 90 percent of those cases, the daily case counts outside of China are now exceeding those within.
On Friday, China reported 331 new cases, while there were 1,027 cases reported elsewhere, according the WHOs latest situation report. The largest outbreak outside of China is currently in South Korea, which has reported 3,150 cases. Italy has the second-largest cluster of cases, followed by the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess, which has now reached 705 cases.
The continued spread and rising case counts outside China are clearly of concern, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday in a media briefing.
Wake up
Yet, while that spread ratchets up risk, he and his fellow experts at WHO also saw reason to be hopeful: most of the cases cropping up in new places can be clearly linked back to known contacts and clusters of casessuch as those from Italy and Iran.
We do not see evidence as yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities, the director-general, who goes by Dr. Tedros, said Friday. As long as thats the case, we still have a chance of containing this virusif robust action is taken to detect cases early, isolate and care for patients, and trace contacts.
And theres clear evidence that containment can work. In addition to Chinas dramatic decline in cases over this month, eight countries with identified cases have gone two weeks without reporting new cases, Dr. Tedros said. And, as of the time of publication Saturday, 15 of the 53 countries with cases were reporting only one new case. Another 19 countries with cases tallied 10 or fewer.
Moreover, Dr. Tedros made a point of putting the global cases in perspective: there are 6,000 or so cases among the more than 6 billion people outside of China.
This virus is serious and dangerous, but it can be contained, Dr. Tedros emphasized.
In fact, the move to increase the threat level should get that very point across, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, said in the briefing.
This is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up. Get ready. This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready. You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world, to be ready, and I think thats what this alert says. It says we can avoid the worst of this, but our level of concern is at its highest.
Not ready
Such readiness to avoid the worst has, unfortunately, not been on display in the United States, so far.
As of Saturday morning, the United States has reported four COVID-19 cases that may represent instances of community spread. That is, the four people may have picked up the infection from people in their own community as the virus spread undetected through the general public. In all four cases, the infected people had no known exposure through travel and had no contact with a person known to be infected.
Its an alarming sign that the USdespite its prominence on the world stage and the time it has had to prepareis failing to detect and contain the virus.
Among the four cases, two are in California, one is in Oregon, and another is in Washington state. Three of the cases (excluding one in California) are considered presumptive for now, meaning that health authorities in the individual states have tested the patients and found them positive, but final confirmation from CDC testing is pending.
The cases, if all are confirmed, bring the countrys tally to at least 66. Of those, 44 are in passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess, and three are in people repatriated from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began in December.
Thirteen cases appear to be travel-related, and two additional cases were contracted from person-to-person spread in the US from a known travel-related case.
The four remaining cases were possibly community spread. One of those casesa California woman who lives in Solano Countywas announced earlier this week. The news cycle was still reeling from it when, late on Friday, news broke of the other three cases.
Testing, testing
The Solano County womans case is particularly worrying because it highlights several weaknesses in the countrys COVID-19 preparedness. The woman reportedly checked into a local hospital with flu-like symptoms February 15. The patient was initially suspected of having COVID-19. But the woman wasnt tested until February 25, largely due to a low availability of testing and federal recommendations that testing focus on people with known exposures (and she had no known exposure). Between that time, her condition deteriorated, and she was intubated and put on a ventilator.
The first clear weakness is the low availability of testing, which has mainly been done in labs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has sent testing kits to states, but some states reported problems with their kits. The CDC has been trying to work out an unspecified glitch in the kits, but the process has been slow. So far, the CDC has reported testing 459 people, which is just a fraction of the number of people that have been tested in other countries.
This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a press briefing Friday. She reported that the CDC has come up with a workaround that will allow states to increase testing.
Increased testing capacity is critical for identifying new cases and preventing further spread of the virus within the US, particularly with the possibility of community spreadand the community in which the first case was identified points to another weakness.
Suspicious spread
The first case of potential community spread occurred in Solano County, California, which just happens to be were hundreds of repatriated citizensat high risk of carrying the virushave been quarantined. Repatriated citizens began arriving at Travis Air Force Base, located in Solano, at the beginning of February, a week or two before the woman developed symptoms. The potential community spread near where high-risk groups of people have been housed raises the possibility that the quarantine failed.
That concern was reinforced by news of a whistleblower allegation that the Department of Health and Human Services sent untrained personnel without proper protective gear to handle those high-risk repatriated citizens. If true, HHS put employees at risk of contracting the virus and then spreading it to their families and communities.
According to the whistleblowers complaint, 13 unprepared employees were sent to Travis Air Force Base in Solano between February 2 and February 7, when planes loaded with repatriated citizens were arriving. The complaint alleges the employees were not tested for coronavirus afterward and returned to their normal offices and duties, with some taking commercial flights back to their stations in various, unspecified parts of the country.
The CDC did not respond to questions from Ars regarding the potential that the quarantine at Travis Air Force Base closed.
The three other, potentially community-spread cases appear to be unconnected to the Solano woman, according to The Washington Post. One case is in a 65-year-old woman from Santa Clara County, California. The case in Oregon was in a person from Washington County who had spent time in an elementary school near Portland. That school has now been closed for cleaning. The case in Washington state is in a high school student from Snohomish County, just north of Seattle. That students school has also been closed, and students with known contact are being isolated at home for 14 days.
The cases are an alarming sign that the US has failed its duty to be ready and has already lost control of the virus.
Communication breakdown
Last, reports this week raised concern of yet another weakness in the countrys preparednessthat information about the virus and the situation in the United States may be being censored by the Trump administration. According to a report Friday in The New York Times, all statements and appearances from federal officials regarding the coronavirusincluding, it seems, those from CDC officialsmust now be filtered through the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who President Trump appointed Wednesday to lead the coronavirus response.
The move has reportedly buttoned up leading experts, notably Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the countrys foremost experts on viruses and infectious disease and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. According to the Times, Dr. Fauci has told colleagues that the White House instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.
Likewise, in the CDCs briefing Friday, Dr. Messonniers comments sounded more carefully vetted than normal and included a conspicuous reference to President Trump. It marked the first time the CDC had referenced the president in a briefing on COVID-19 cases, according to transcripts of the briefings.
As always, President Trumps and our number-one priority is the health and safety of the American people, Dr. Messonnier said in her opening remarks Friday.
The CDC declined to a request to comment from Ars on the reported censorship.
According to CDCs archive of transcripts, Dr. Messonnier had only mentioned the word trump on one other occasion, on February 3, when she said, And certainly, what Ive seen in situations like this, science should trump everything else."

The company has confirmed plans to cut a large portion of its workforce after the union representing Kickstarter employees said it had ratified a layoff agreement on May 1st. Layoffs could affect up to 45 percent of Kickstarter staff. 
Last week, Lyft laid off nearly 1,000 of its employees, and rumors suggest Uber may have to address its headcount, again, soon. GoPro and Magic Leap have also adjusted their staffing levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It’s a time of mixed fortunes. We’re in the middle of earnings season, and tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Apple have had mixed fortunes. The latter has suffered from reduced hardware sales -- that happens when your stores are closed -- while Microsoft saw ‘minimal’ impact on its business and Facebook has seen a jump in its audience figures as people stay indoors and connect to their screens.

Tesla has applied for a license to become a UK energy provider 
The company may bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain.
Tesla has reportedly applied for a license to become an energy provider in the UK. That means it might bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain, much as it did with its 100-megawatt installation in South Australia. It may also be a way for the company to introduce a platform called Autobidder, which allows renewable power suppliers to trade energy.
The company hasn’t confirmed any plans for large-scale PowerPacks in the UK, but the country generates 40 percent of its energy from renewables, including wind and solar, which means the system would make sense, smoothing out gaps in renewable energy production. 
Tesla could also deploy its new platform, Autobidder, which uses machine-learning tech and cloud platforms to optimize power distribution. It’s a dry topic but could make power production more efficient. Continue reading.
Google is working on 4K/HDR streaming to Android TV for Stadia

Stadia, Google’s game streaming service has already rolled out 4K streaming on the web and 5.1 surround sound for players using a browser? So what’s next? Something pretty interesting, according to code dug up by 9to5Google. As there’s only a handful of Android phones with a 4K-ready display, these settings are likely in preparation for Stadia’s Android TV app. The company may be preparing to add the option of 4K and HDR-quality streaming on Android-powered TVs, as well as built-in messaging to match other modern gaming services.

Juul may exit France, Spain and other European markets
It reportedly has nothing to do with COVID-19.
Juul is preparing to leave five European countries within the year.  Unlike all the shutdowns and layoffs reported over the past months, BuzzFeed’s source says the decision didn’t have anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic.
The e-cigarette maker is reportedly planning to pull out of Austria, Belgium, Portugal and Spain in July, followed by France at the end of the year. Juul enjoys relatively high sales in Spain and France compared to the rest of the continent, but not high enough to justify the costs and the trouble of dealing with regulators. The European Union has stringent requirements when it comes to e-cigarette products, as the publication notes, requiring companies to stick to a nicotine limit of 20 milligrams per milliliter of fluid. Meanwhile, in the US, a single Juul pod can contain up to 59 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter. Continue reading.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)How bad will it get? That was the question this week, but it applied to several things: the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus around the world, the resulting stock market plunge and the concern about whether America's political leaders are up to the challenge.
An outbreak of the disease is inevitable in the US, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tuesday: ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but ... a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."" 
Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner, wrote that the disease ""will test our government's response and resiliency. How we weather the outbreak also hinges on our trust that the government has our best intentions at heart."" She added that, ""we don't yet know if the trajectory of COVID-19 will be mild, moderate, or severe"" but it makes sense to prepare for the worst case. 
Wall Street apparently agreed, with the Dow plunging 3,583 points, making it by percentage terms the worst week since October, 2008. In the Perspectives section of CNN Business, Paul LaMonica recalled covering that financial crisis. ""That was a terrifying time but this seems a lot scarier,"" he wrote. ""Yes, the Fed can do lots of things to help soothe frayed nerves when stocks are in free fall, but there is little that the Fed or President Trump and Congress, for that matter can do to solve this biological crisis for the markets and the economy.""
""Even if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That's because China has become a global economic powerhouse."" And by now the virus has gone well beyond the borders of China.
""The best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts -- not to the President. He's not telling the truth. He's gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts,"" Ghitis wrote. She noted, ""It's not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump's 'black swan,' the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection.""
In the Washington Post, David Ignatius wrote that, ""one of President Trump's failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors...Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner's suggestion that the CDC was 'exaggerating' the threat."" Taking it further, at a South Carolina rally Friday, Trump said, ""the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus"" in what he called ""their new hoax.""
Presidents are called upon to reassure the nation in the wake of traumatic events, wrote Joe Lockhart -- Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn after the 9/11 attacks. So far, Trump is failing that leadership test, Lockhart said. ""He has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home.""
Chelsea Clinton and the co-author of her book on global health, Devi Sridhar, noted that, ""President Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress."" 
Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the effort to combat the virus. ""It's hard to imagine a worse choice for a job that requires respect for public health,"" wrote Pence biographer Michael D'Antonio. ""In addition to his climate-change skepticism...he is known for penning, when he was running for Congress, what could be generously termed a nutty article that said, 'despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill.'"" 
As we wait to see the extent of the virus outbreak, here's some useful advice from Dr. Colleen Kraft, the associate medical director of Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: ""Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers.""
The Democratic primary is at a critical moment. Joe Biden scored a decisive victory Saturday in South Carolina, but will he have the momentum to unseat Bernie Sanders as the Democrats' frontrunner? 
""Moderate voters may well snap back into the Biden camp,"" wrote Jeff Yang, ""and other centrist candidates may feel the pressure to make an increasingly hard decision: Whether to stay in the race and continue to fragment the vote against Sanders or bow out and lend support to Biden."" 
On Super Tuesday, March 3, roughly a third of the delegates will be chosen and the race could be decided within weeks -- or remain hotly contested until the Democrats meet for their convention in Milwaukee in July.
Elliot Williams summed up the moderates' feeling: Sanders ""struggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). He all but ensures that his Republican opponent will make the election a referendum on socialism...Attack ads from President Donald Trump and his allies assailing Sanders' views on Fidel Castro and Soviet Russia practically write themselves. And don't get me started about the conduct of some of his supporters and even some of his staffers online."" 
""Take a deep breath"" anyway, Williams added. ""Bernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump -- maybe even a better one."" 
When Sanders praised some aspects of dictator Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, critics called it an unforced error and said it would hurt him badly with Cuban-American emigres in Florida. Rebecca Bodenheimer agreed that it was ""ill-advised"" but argued that it wasn't wrong: ""Both the things he said were true: the Castro regime (and the successive iterations of it under Raúl Castro and now Miguel Díaz-Canel) was and is authoritarian...And, early on in the 1960s, Castro initiated a grassroots program that resulted in a massive increase in literacy in Cuba, as well as building a strong universal healthcare and educational system.""
Sanders is stirring excitement around the country, Dean Obeidallah noted: ""Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000. Two weeks ago, the night before the New Hampshire primary, Sanders packed more than 7,500 into an arena, with USA Today noting that this 'event easily marked the largest in the Democratic contest in New Hampshire.'""
The Vermont senator could win it all, wrote John Avlon, but he has a hill to climb because he's out of sync with much of the country ideologically. ""Bernie Sanders has built a movement and he has momentum. But there are plenty of rational reasons to think that nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk -- and could deliver Donald Trump a second term."" 
A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent contemplated the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race with real dread. ""Both represent two sides of the same coin,"" Dent wrote. ""They both appeal to anger. They scream that the system is rigged, you're a victim, and that they can give you your country back if only you follow them."" 
Millions of voters are in the middle, between the left and the right, he said. They ""want a candidate who believes in capitalism, reasonably regulated market-based solutions to problems, social tolerance and acceptance, and constructive international engagement...Most of all they'll want someone who conducts himself or herself in a thoughtful, deliberate and measured way. They want stability, not chaos and recklessness."" 
A food fight in South Carolina
The Democrats' South Carolina debate was fierce, with the moderators letting candidates talk over each other. It ""was somewhere between an episode of 'The Jerry Springer Show' and a 'Real Housewives' reunion: messy, chaotic and embarrassing for nearly everyone involved,"" wrote Raul Reyes. 
""It was inevitable that, as the stakes have grown higher in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, there would be a greater sense of urgency among the candidates to stand out. But that did not mean the event had to devolve into a free-for-all."" 
""Moderates across the country exhaled a collective sigh of relief after Tuesday's debate,"" wrote Tara Setmayer. ""Joe Biden is back. It was clear the former Vice President was much more comfortable and cogent on the debate stage this time around in South Carolina.""
Elizabeth Warren picked up where she left off at the Nevada debate, with blistering attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg. But the former New York mayor seemed much more prepared this time. ""Mayor Michael Bloomberg fought his way back into contention in the Democratic primary for president by obeying a simple rule: never let an attack go unanswered,"" wrote Errol Louis.
The sheer force of Bloomberg's money cascade is keeping him a major factor in the election. He could wind up spending billions on advertising in pursuit of the presidency, wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, who argued that whatever its political impact, it is a financially savvy move. 
""As an aging billionaire many times over, Mayor Bloomberg sees the clock ticking."" Bloomberg's fortune has been estimated at more than $60 billion. Whatever he doesn't spend or give away will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax.
So if he spends $5 billion to get to the White House, the US Treasury will ultimately lose out on $2 billion in taxes, McCaffery pointed out.
""This is in no way a condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg, who has presumably earned his money legally, and can spend it however he wants, again perfectly legally... It is, rather, a condemnation of a tax system that both allows some billionaires to amass wealth and to spend it, tax free and with no questions asked."" 
After the Harvey Weinstein verdict
The onetime Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault and rape charges that could send him to prison for a minimum of five years. It was a win for the #MeToo movement, wrote Caroline Polisi. 
The ""verdict will encourage more victims of sexual assault to come forward and report their abuse, with the knowledge that although the road to justice will not be easy, it will at least be a possibility. And that is so much more than they ever had before."" 
Two things have to happen now, wrote Kara Alaimo. There needs to be more visibility about non-disclosure agreements that have been used to bury allegations against powerful abusers, she said.
""Second, lawmakers need to help victims learn their rights and avenues for redress -- especially those who are most disenfranchised. If it's hard for Hollywood actresses like Ashley Judd -- whose sexual harassment case against Weinstein was thrown out of court by a judge and characterized as not justified by Weinstein's attorney -- to pursue justice, consider how difficult it would be for people with far fewer resources.""
A raid on the fifth grade 
Wazhma Frogh is nearly 40 but she can't forget the raid on her Kabul public school when she was in fifth grade.
""I still remember the exact words of those bearded men, Kalashnikovs on their shoulders, batons in their hand -- as they yelled, 'Get out of here. Girls don't belong in schools!' I can even remember the cries of several of our teachers, who were wearing skirts and were beaten in their legs, as the Mujahedeen shouted that their skirt wearing days were over.""
It was the start of a civil war that closed down the schools. Frogh, now the leader of the Women and Peace Studies organization in Kabul, wrote that she ""never saw my classmates or my teachers ever again.""
She argued that, as the US embarks on a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, it's vital that the experience of the early 1990s -- ""when civil war and extremist forces came to dominate our politics and our lives"" -- not be repeated. 
Peter Bergen wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. ""For the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and he could just as easily pull the plug entirely."" The agreement calls for a full withdrawal over a 14-month period but officials say that is dependent on what the Taliban does.
Katharine Johnson, an American hero
Katharine Johnson was so central to NASA's exploration of space that, as Reshma Saujani wrote, ""Astronaut John Glenn famously asked Katherine to personally recheck the calculations made by electronic computers before his Friendship 7 mission to space. 'If she says they're good,' he said, 'then I'm ready to go.'"" On that mission in 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.
Johnson, who died this week at 101, lived to see her story told in the Oscar-nominated film ""Hidden Figures."" She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson. ""In a world that all too often tells girls -- especially black girls -- that they don't belong in STEM, Katherine Johnson was exactly the icon our girls needed,"" wrote Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit.
""Katherine was the epitome of bravery. When she was told that women didn't participate in the briefings at NASA; she asked whether there was a law against it. There wasn't. So Katherine started attending briefings. She asked questions. She, bravely, put herself in the rooms where she knew she deserved to be."""

Once the A100 is installed in Argonne, researchers there will “be able to screen 1 billion drugs in under 24 hours,” Kimberly Powell, Vice President of Healthcare at NVIDIA, told reporters in a briefing. Without the added computing power, researchers would need close to a year to screen the same number of therapeutics.
“This supercomputer is going to combine both accelerated computing and artificial intelligence,” Powell continued. “Critical applications in molecular dynamics simulation, where you can understand how molecules interact with drugs, how to interfere with the virus protein binds to the cell protein and how to block it with a molecule. And then how can we screen as many drugs as possible so we can more quickly get that drug candidate into experimentation and into clinical trials.” Up to 140 A100s can be run in parallel, pooling the combined power of their GPUs into a “DGX SuperPOD” that boasts more than 700 petaflops of processing capability. 
NVIDIA also announced a host of other new services it plans to roll out to hospitals across the country. Using its line of Clara Parabrick GPUs, NVIDIA has managed to reduce the time needed to analyze an entire human genome from around 30 hours to less than 20 minutes. The company is also teaming with more than a dozen industry partners and 50 hospitals around the globe to help better protect frontline medical staff through the use of remote monitoring, video conferencing and at-a-distance body temperature monitoring in a program called NVIDIA Clara Guardian."

After speaking with medical professionals, he believes that the issue isn’t COVID-19, but “organ failure through chronic hypoxia.” Essentially, a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream means that people’s bodies slowly suffocate to death over a period of days. 
The issue is often compounded by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), inflammation of the lungs, which makes breathing difficult. “Their lungs are compromised to the extent that, even with a ventilator on pure oxygen breathing for them, it’s impossible to get enough oxygen.” Reynolds believes that the solution isn’t more ventilation but to make breathing easier for patients in respiratory distress. And for a person with expertise in diving and diving equipment, the obvious answer is a hyperbaric chamber.
Hyperbaric chambers work by increasing the pressure outside the body, and they’re commonly used to treat breathing-related conditions. First, the lungs work less to breathe because the air pressure is so much greater that air forces itself in. Second, at higher pressures, oxygen is more soluble, so every breath gets more oxygen into the bloodstream. And higher levels of blood oxygenation, according to the Mayo Clinic, can “promote healing and fight infection.”
“Hyperbaric oxygen [therapy] is known to reduce inflammation,” said Dr. Reynolds, which could mitigate the effects of ARDS, too. Unfortunately, hyperbaric chambers are not common and are only used in very specific medical and diving-related scenarios. “There are not anywhere near enough hyperbaric chambers to cope with thousands of patients,” said Dr. Reynolds. Since it’s impractical to quickly mass-produce these chambers, Reynolds and his team started looking for alternatives.
Enter the grounded aircraft.
When a plane is in flight, it reaches heights where the air is very thin, and the air pressure is far weaker than at sea level. That means it’s doubly hard for a person to breathe at altitude, so planes are pressurized to near sea-level. Since planes aren’t in use, can already adjust their internal pressure and have oxygen routing capabilities, it’s plausible that they’d do the job. 
Reynolds suggests having a series of beds inside the cabin, with medical professionals in attendance, just like a normal ward. There would be a 90-minute cycle in which the cabin pressure would be increased to between 1.6 and 2 atmospheres. During this time, each patient would be breathing high-pressure oxygen through a mask in the hope of improving their condition. At the end of each 90-minute cycle, the plane would be depressurized and staff and equipment could move in and out as required.
Dr. Gerado Bosco is a professor at the University of Padua, specializing in hyperbaric therapy and biomechanics. He is one of a handful of researchers waiting for approval to begin testing hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. In trials, his team would expose patients to different pressures in 90-minute cycles and examine their response. The hope is that patients find it easier to breathe, their ARDS is mitigated and their immune response improves. 
He says that the plan to use grounded aircraft as hyperbaric treatment centers is “intriguing,” but that it’s far too early to comment. He does believe that, if the treatment is successful in trials, it may lead to a “tremendous decrease in ventilatory response.” 
The International Hyperbarics Association has published information relating to a study from Wuhan, China. According to the report, which we have not yet been able to confirm, Dr. Zhong Yangling, treated five COVID-19 patients, two in critical condition, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. All of them showed signs of hypoxia before the course started, and all five are said to have improved after the first two sessions. 
A study is being prepared in the US, and Dr. Bosco’s Italian study is working in partnership with a Canadian trial led by Dr. Rita Katznelson at Toronto General Hospital. The latter has started a JustGiving page to get funding for the trial -- and hopes to raise $250,000 (USD). 
As for the planes themselves, Technion University Aerospace researcher Neta Blum says it is possible to pressurize a cabin to up to 2.5atm if boosted by the pressure at sea level. She mentioned the one issue may be that repeated cycles of pressurizing and depressurizing the cabin could cause “fatigue cracks” in the plane’s fuselage. That may deter airlines from loaning their craft to the effort, especially if it renders them unusable in future. 
But nothing can, or should, be done until the science -- which, at present, is pretty flimsy -- is properly tested. If those studies show promise, however, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may prove to be a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19."

Whatever we were used to, in terms of cost, convenience and experience, it’s not going to be the same for a while. Just last week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said that only 45 percent of travelers asked intended to fly “within a few months of the pandemic subsiding.”
Perhaps the biggest casualty of COVID-19 so far has been the Airbus A380 and the flying it represented. This “superjumbo” jet, competition for the Boeing 747, was designed to offer mass transit in the skies, to convey huge volumes of people around the world in its double-decker cabin and a potential capacity of more than 850.
Work on the A380 began in the early ‘90s, with the first vessel entering service in 2007, and it’s instantly recognizable. Less a plane and more like a bus, it hauls people between major hub airports, where they get a single-aisle craft to their destination. The idea of air travel, back at the A380’s genesis, was that you’d fly to, say, JFK, and then get an A380 to Cape Town, Paris or Shanghai.
A number of carriers have A380s, but it’s become synonymous with Emirates, which has a staggering 115 of the craft in its fleet. But despite the plane’s relative youth, launching just over a decade ago, the virus has hastened the A380’s demise. Airbus announced last year it would stop manufacturing the plane, and according to Bloomberg, even Emirates, its biggest booster, no longer wants its remaining deliveries. 
Other carriers are also swinging the axe on their A380s, including Air France-KLM, which brought forward the “definitive end” of A380 operations by two years. In a statement, the airline said that doing so would make its fleet more competitive, with a “significantly reduced environmental footprint.” In its place would be smaller planes, like Airbus A350s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. 
Business Traveler said that Lufthansa is speeding up the phase-out of its own A380s, reducing its fleet of the superjumbo by half. Qantas, similarly, has said it will use smaller single-aisle planes on its long-haul routes until at least September — with eight of its 10 A380s grounded until then. 
From an airworthiness perspective, the A380’s retirement is premature — very premature. For comparison, a Boeing document from 2013 says the operational lifespan of its commercial aircraft is around 30 years. AerSale, a company offering aftermarket support for planes, says that “from purchase to retirement,” a plane should last “between 20 and 36 years.” If the A380 disappears from the skies by 2022, it will have lived — in total — for not even half of its potential lifespan. 
The problem with the A380 is that Airbus had banked on a “hub and spoke” model for international travel, but failed to spot the flaw in that plan. Taking a short hop to a hub airport and then on to another on the other side of the world will always add hours to a journey. It’s something that rival Boeing did pick up on. And it went in the opposite direction. 
Back in 2002, Boeing’s Peter Rumsey, then head of new airplane development, wrote that passengers “demonstrated a preference for flights that take less time.” He added that it was “common sense” to take people “where they want to go,” and what passengers wanted more than anything else was more direct flights.
At the time, Rumsey was hyping Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser concept, a new plane with a delta wing formation that would cruise at Mach 0.95 (around 729MPH). The Sonic Cruiser would fly higher than existing planes, with reduced turbulence and faster speeds. And, crucially, rather than trying to build a plane to cater for 800-plus passengers, Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser would transport between 200 and 250. 
The Sonic Cruiser project did not survive, with a post-9/11 slump causing interest in the project to dry up. But its original spirit, and some of the ideas, trickled down to Boeing’s next big, albeit far less radical, new aircraft: the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 is made of lightweight composite materials, has a higher internal pressure (for passenger comfort) and is far cheaper to run than similarly sized rivals.
The A380 had other problems, too. Its sheer size meant that airports had to make special alterations to their gates to accommodate such a plane. It also meant that it required larger crews and more engines, increasing the cost of each flight. One Forbes report said that every hour the A380 was in flight cost between $26,000 and $29,000. A Dreamliner, by comparison, costs closer to $11,000 an hour to fly.
Airlines will likely replace the A380 with smaller aircraft from Airbus and Boeing to reduce emissions and to deal with a drop in expected passenger numbers. What we won’t see, in the eyes of at least one aviation expert, is news of a next-generation airplane in the near future. 
Bill Blain is a market strategist at Shard Capital with a focus on the business of flying. He feels the aviation industry has badly misjudged the market. “It’s a right bloody mess,” he said, with both companies obsessing over making bigger, more capacious aircraft. Blain said that, while the Dreamliner is a “wonderful plane,” a better bet would have been a smaller plane.
He believes that airlines were always going to want planes closer to the 737 — a narrow-body plane with a capacity around 200 — than the bigger 747. “If you [as an airline] can get a small plane that you can make economical with 200 people on board,” then you’re golden. Blain said that Boeing’s failure to properly replace the 737 with a brand new aircraft has led to tragedy. The 737 Max, which modified the existing 737 design, led to two crashes that claimed 346 lives.
Airlines will need to pay for these early retirements, but Blain said they can’t simply raise ticket prices. The post-COVID economy is likely to be in recession or at least stricken enough that money is tight for everyone. “There’s not going to be the money available [in the economy] to hike airline prices, and airlines need bums on seats,” he said. 
What’s missing, however, is a next-generation advance that could really move the aviation market forward. Blain said the planes airlines will buy, like Airbus’ A320/321 and Boeing’s 737 Max, use “old tech” and aren’t very fuel efficient, both things airlines crave. He adds that both companies have neglected to invest in training new engineers to replace the experienced ones who are reaching retirement age. 
Airbus and Boeing declined to comment for this story, but both companies have new aircraft in the works. The latter is working on a “New Midsize Airplane,” which will reportedly seat between 220 and 270 passengers. However, Reuters reported in April that the program halted while the company scrambles to fix the 737 Max debacle.
Airbus’ next-generation craft could have been the hybrid-electric E-Fan X, co-developed with Rolls Royce. But that initiative died in April, a year before the aircraft was expected to take to the skies. The company is also working on a delta-wing concept, MAVERIC, with a bigger cabin but with a 20 percent reduction in fuel burn. But that won’t be ready for decades, if ever, and there’s still a need for aircraft that can ride the rough skies that COVID leaves behind."

These gadgets include wearable proximity alarms that beep when you’ve been within six feet of someone too long, pulse oximeters, thermometers, and that hot $300 titanium smart ring everyone’s talking about, the Oura. The ring tracks and analyses data like sleep, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory function, and more. The NBA reportedly bought over 1,000 Oura rings for the season restart.
Players will also have plentiful at-will testing, too, making them the envy of most Americans.
Yet it’s Oura in all the headlines, the sci-fi wearable everyone suddenly wants. The ring’s hype in press is that it detects coronavirus symptoms up to three days in advance with 90 percent accuracy. That claim comes from a May press release basically promoting an app made by Oura, The West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI), and WVU Medicine. The app came out of a study between Oura and RNI about the ring’s potential to predict coronavirus among front-line healthcare workers. It’s a pretty cool idea, but my point is that it’s the app making the claim, and not necessarily the ring.
Oura, to its credit, has also been partnering with other teams at the forefront of COVID-19 research, like the USCF TemPredict study.
There are so many caveats here. For one, these studies are funded by the company selling the product. You could play buzzword bingo with every Oura press release until your eyes cross. Plus all the questions people like me have about Oura’s technical implementation and security implications (especially regarding Bluetooth), false positives, what Oura means by data sharing for in-app advertising, why they seemed to let their Android app languish, is it watching us masturbate like Ceiling Cat, and just how buggy is this magical wearable anyway? And, of course, what they think about making one for poor people. Because thanks to COVID-19, we’re going to have a lot more of those, too.
So we have questions. Lots of them. But we’re also really, truly in a life or death situation. So the deeper question is, are wearables finally getting to the point where they could detect COVID-19 symptoms before they appear (or provide a form of confirmation at the onset)?
Meet the biohacker who survived COVID-19
Biohacker Mikey Sklar had an unfortunate opportunity to find out for us when he contracted COVID-19 in the second week of March while using two fitness trackers: the Garmin Venu watch and Oura Ring.
“On the evening of March 16th, some anomalies started showing up even though I was not yet symptomatic,” Sklar wrote. “I would proceed to sweat through the night and wake up with a killer headache, terrible body aches, chills and a diminished sense of smell.” He then detailed some pretty obvious differences in his biometrics on the Garmin between his “normal” and “sick” states. 
His testing ordeal was intense, though Sklar told Engadget via email “Getting tested was more complicated at that time.”
If you use a sleep tracker like the Garmin or Oura, and you want to know what to look for regarding possible COVID-19 symptoms, Sklar noted his differences between “normal” and “sick” as: 
<ul><li>Resting Heart Rate increased by 15 BPM (lower is better)
</li><li>Heart Rate Variability decreased 30 BPM (higher is better)
</li><li>Average Overnight Body Temperature increased by 3.3 degrees fahrenheit
</li><li>Respiratory Rate increased by 2.7 breaths per minute
</li></ul>Sklar was one of the lucky ones. “My symptoms were limited and pretty much just being uncomfortable for a little over a week,” he wrote. Even so, he connected with developers of sleep app Bioloop, “who had been working with Stanford and Oura Ring data to find anomalies in a persons biometric history. They were looking for the same sort of jumps in biometrics I mentioned above RHR, HRV, body temperature and respiratory rate,” he added.
At the end of it all, Sklar concluded that “fitness trackers cannot tell us what we have,” but that they “can give us a little bit of warning when our bodies start fighting.” 
It’s a pretty even-handed take from someone who is really into hacking and tracking themselves. Some NBA players, on the other hand, are not cool with that at all. While using Oura rings is voluntary and the NBA is making data privacy promises to players, Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma tweeted, “Looks like a tracking device.”
A coronavirus panopticon (on your wrist)
Kuzma is right to be suspicious; he’s absolutely correct. Oura isn’t all that different than other sleep and wellness trackers, yet these devices gather and record a wealth of deeply personal data, they use security-problematic things like Bluetooth, anyone who knows what they’re doing can poke at the data to get more info like location, and companies get sold (as well as pressured by governments). 
From every technical perspective, something like the Oura represents an elite, thorough, and worryingly accurate tracking device bar none, terrifying if it were to be used for evil (or by Palantir, or Facebook for that matter). Moreso now that one country is taking coronavirus wearables in a very Orwellian direction — and that country is Singapore.
Not everyone in Singapore is using the country’s contact-tracing TraceTogether app. Use among the population never made it past 25% saturation, partly because not everyone has a smartphone, and largely because Singapore’s app doesn’t work on iPhones. That’s because TraceTogether breaks a serious security “best practice”, namely that Apple does not allow iPhone apps running in the background to access Bluetooth.
Singapore’s new solution to this mess of its own making is to release a wearable contact-tracing tracking device to its citizens and threaten to make it compulsory for the entire population to wear.
“Whether circumstances would ever require mandatory adoption we cannot say,” said Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative Minister-in-charge Vivian Balakrishnan on June 5th. “I am going to do my best to push participation rates up without having to go down the mandatory route.”
A petition was immediately created, with 52,000 signatures as of this week for “Singapore says ‘No’ to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing.” It explains how easily the device will be able to surveil citizens, and states:
The Government looks to the Covid-19 pandemic as the perfect excuse to realise what it has always envisioned for us – this country’s populace: to surveil us with impunity, to track us without any technological inhibitions, and maintain a form of movement monitoring on each of us at all times and places. And to do so by decreeing it compulsory for all law-abiding persons to become ‘recipients’.
We – as free, independent, and lawful members of the public of Singapore – condemn the device’s implementation as blatant infringements upon our rights to privacy, personal space, and freedom of movement. We reject the notion that the non-efficacy of the Trace Together initiative be superceded by a regime that could potentially require all members of the public (regardless of their age, susceptibility to disease, or health status) to give up these rights under fear – not of infection from Covid-19 – but of prosecution by the state.
The point of showing you all of this is not to scare you. We’ve had enough of that, and we should probably brace for more. It’s also tempting to think that I’ve taken you to these vistas of dark possibilities because I get off on terrifying readers, or desire a reputation for traumatically scaring my readers. I do not.
There is a lot going on and it is more than some people can take. If you use fitness trackers, hopefully Mikey Sklar’s experience can help you (he will also tell you what he did while surviving it, all you have to do is ask him).
But I’m also looking into the face of all this injustice, unfairness, greed, madness, and unnecessary heartbreak here on this page because, well, anger is a form of hope -- and we need as much of that as we can right now. As inconceivable as it is, the US has officially unflattened the curve, so terribly that the world is readying to quarantine us to our own soil. I think we can be forgiven for being angry, being scared, and for there being just an overwhelming sadness in everything we do.
I also think it is entirely appropriate to talk about why and how we DIY our way through this, whether it’s learning from fitness tracker hackers, demanding answers for people who can’t access these technologies because of inequalities tech startups refuse to acknowledge, or seeing the people of Singapore oppose invasive digital tracking and learning from it. We are no longer bewitched by shiny gadgets that offer convenience and connectivity. It’s time to make those gadgets work for us, instead."

The country has ditched its centralized approach to COVID-19 tracking, based on Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), in favor of a “decentralized architecture” that only stores contact data on devices. this more closely resembles the approach Apple and Google will take when their beta tracing tools arrive in the next few days. It’s not clear when Germany’s app will be ready.
Contact tracing apps like COVIDSafe could prove vital to ending lockdowns by making it easier to track the spread (and hopefully, decline) of the virus as public life resumes. Rather than shutting down most of society, officials could limit closures and stay-home orders to specific businesses and people. The challenge is getting enough adoption for the apps to be effective. Australia, for instance, wants at least 40 percent of the population to enlist. That’s a massive amount for any app, and privacy reassurances might be crucial for reaching that target."

A handful of US states, including Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina, plan to use the API for their own apps.
While 22 countries have requested the API, that doesn’t mean they will all put it to use. The UK said it won’t use the Apple-Google model, and countries like Australia have already rolled out their own solutions. Still, Apple and Google expect more countries to request the API in the coming weeks, and the World Health Organization (WHO) said it will release a contact tracing app for countries that don’t make their own. The WHO may use the Apple-Google tech.
Technology can help health officials rapidly tell someone they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Today the Exposure Notification API we created with @Google is available to help public health agencies make their COVID-19 apps effective while protecting user privacy.
— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) May 20, 2020
On its end, Apple is adding exposure notification functionality to iOS 13.5, released today, so its devices should work with the API and iOS apps that use it. Google is rolling out a Play Services update today, so Android devices running 6.0 and above will be compatible.
As previously reported, PHAs that use the API must agree to only use the tech for COVID-19 contact tracing. Users must consent before the app uses the API and before they share a positive test result. Users can also turn exposure notifications on and off. Apps cannot request access to location data, and they are not permitted to use user data for things like targeted advertising.
The API will allow PHAs to define what constitutes an exposure event and determine transmission risk factors. For instance, a PHA may decide to send exposure notifications if you were exposed for several minutes (say, on public transit) but not if you were exposed for a few seconds (passing someone on the sidewalk). 
Despite safeguards put in place to protect user privacy -- all metadata associated with Bluetooth will be encrypted -- the API and contact tracing apps will likely raise privacy concerns. And yet, to be truly effective, they will need widespread adoption."

It has announced that it’s begun looking at a way of enabling wearables to participate in exposure notification systems. The idea is to let smartwatches, fitness trackers and even Bluetooth wristbands to form part of the contact tracing network. That way, currently disconnected groups like children and people in care homes could be tracked without needing to buy them all a new phone. For instance, a kid wearing a Fitbit could go about their day, downloading the data to their parent’s phone when they get home from school."

Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images
To get myself through the pandemic, Ive been summoning everything Ive learned about surviving in a new world as an immigrant. I left the Philippines as a kid to join my parents in California. Walang tiyaga, walang nilaga, my grandma used to say. Strictly translated, it means no perseverance, no stew. That lesson on weathering hardship recently took on new meaning.
Im not just worried about the virus. Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans are up, while President Trump continues to characterize the disease as foreign and Chinese. Some of my friends are worried about heading outside not only because of the virus, but because of the racist slurs hurled at them. 
Went to take out trash.Was talking on phone in Chinese. Man walked by on sidewalk &amp; in interest of social distancing,I said,""sorry, go ahead."" ""FUCKING CHINESE,""he yelled loud enough I could hear him over aide's voice on phone. I turned to look at him to make sure I heard right

Filipinos, like other immigrant groups, tend to be overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic. The Philippines sends more nurses abroad to staff the worlds health care systems than any other country in the world. Filipinos also make up a third of all cruise ship workers and, in China, are the largest group of migrant domestic workers. The service industry that delivers food to our doorsteps relies on immigrants, too. 
immigrants are overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic
Many of the neighborhoods where people of color and immigrants live have more air pollution, which can be deadly during outbreaks of a virus that affects the lungs. For instance, Latinos are over 51 percent more likely to live in counties with dangerous levels of smog than non-Hispanic whites. That can lead to chronic conditions such as asthma that make someone especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Pollution has also been linked to heart disease; people with serious heart conditions are also at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.
Theres more. Some immigrants are afraid to seek care because they are worried that they will endanger their own immigration status by doing so. Under a new rule, a person who uses public benefits like Medicaid can be denied a green card. This doesnt apply to permanent residents renewing their green cards, but misinformation is already stopping people from getting care. After pushback from Democrats, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it wouldnt penalize green card applicants for getting treatment or testing for COVID-19. ICE announced on the 18th that it wont carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities; advocates and doctors worried that the fear of getting swept up by ICE might keep people from getting care. But that might not matter if people are too afraid to see a doctor. 
With any disaster, some people are hit first and worst. There are parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental injustice, says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who led the EPAs efforts to address environmental racism and injustice under the Obama administration. In both crises, the people facing the greatest risk are often people of color, working class families, and the poor. More of our folks are going to die disproportionately, he says, meaning black, brown, and indigenous communities. The people calling the shots dont come from the places that are most affected so they often dont understand whats happening on the ground. They might even make decisions that make things worse.
More of our folks are going to die disproportionately
Now, the Trump administration is using the pandemic as an excuse to push hard-line immigration policies it would have pursued anyway, says Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. [Theyre] really taking advantage of this moment, even though its a questionable decision to pour resources into that, she says. Maybe we shouldnt be concentrating more on finding masks for doctors and nurses than we should be on kicking asylum seekers out of the country. 
Pierce thinks more people will lose their work authorization or violate their visas because US Citizenship and Immigration Services has shut down its offices and suspended in-person meetings that immigrants must attend to keep their legal status. That means more people could face deportation or detention in facilities that, like prisons, can become hotbeds for disease. While immigrant rights advocates are calling for detention centers to shut down, the Trump administration is using them to fearmonger. 
People in detention could pass the virus on to customs and border patrol officers, and even the United States population as a whole, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a March 20th briefing on the pandemic. Migrants in [detention] facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic, he added. That day, the administration announced it would begin to remove anyone crossing US borders illegally, including people seeking asylum, immediately without due process. 
Ive heard this crap my whole life: that immigrants take more than we give whether thats overburdening health care, snatching jobs, or whatever so lets send them away. Racism and xenophobia has always threatened my existence in this country. 
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics. Italian immigrants were scapegoats for the New York City polio epidemics in 1907 and 1916. Cholera was called Asiatic cholera in the 1800s and tuberculosis called the Jewish disease in the 1900s. Thousands of people died from AIDS before the Reagan administration began taking the epidemic seriously in the mid 1980s, after making callous jokes about the disease referred to as gay plague. 
With this new virus, something was triggered that is always latently there, under the surface, which is this fear of the other and the idea that bad things come from elsewhere, York University professor Roger Keil told The Verge in February. 
The virus is already spreading in the US; its useless to scapegoat migrants at our borders when we now have more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world. The Latin American country with the most cases of COVID-19 is Brazil, which had 2,433 cases on the 26th just over a tenth of the number of infections in New York City alone. It seems likelier that migrants in detention centers will get sick here. And deporting people who were infected in the US back to other countries means spreading the disease further. 
Shifting blame onto others does nothing to keep Americans, including myself, safe. Its a waste of energy when every moment matters in our response to the crisis. Ive watched New York Citys local officials plead daily for ventilators and federal assistance. As someone who calls this place home, this is terrifying. My mom and many of my aunties are nurses in the US; they need more masks and medical supplies to keep people healthy. 
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder, both Ali and Pierce told me. Another lesson Ive learned from my community is that the only way we beat the odds is when we show up for each other. My aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandmothers stepped in to take care of me in the Philippines until my parents were on solid footing and could send for me. Together, they got me here to where I am today. The only way to get through this crisis will be to do so together, too. My mom and aunties will take care of you when you get sick. Make sure to take care of them, too. Theyre immigrants, and well need them.

Grindr is at least up-front about the topic; even still, the hookup app has no info on the erotic quandaries of quarantine.
Tinder, for its part, has acknowledged the coronavirus. But rather than actually talk about hookups and viral loads, the dating app avoided the specific reason why it would say anything in the first place. ""While we want you to continue to have fun,"" its glib pop-up stated, ""protecting yourself from the Coronavirus is more important."" This was followed by a four-point ""wash your hands"" shortlist and a link to the World Health Organization.
Grindr serves 5 million users worldwide; Bumble has 22 million. Tinder counts 50 million members globally. Since sex and dating is a contact sport, you'd think that being able to tell 77 million people specific ways not to die while using their dating apps would be of the utmost urgency. Think about it: they have a unique chance to talk about what's really going on with quarantine quandaries and tech-enabled hookups.
But ew, sex. It's like they either forgot that dating's raison d'être is intimacy — or they're shoveling a bullshit pretense that their apps have nothing to do with sex.
Dating and hookup app users have adapted to COVID-19, even if prudish tech companies haven't. There's a surge in bios now looking for quarantine amor; cuddle pals and shut-in lovers, to ""ride it out,"" if you will. It's enough to make the ""wash your hands"" pop-ups look criminally negligent. Buzzfeed reported Tinder users saying they weren't that concerned about catching coronavirus, with one male saying he has ""no intention of letting it dictate my social life.""
I'll bet those 77 million people desperately want to know how ""social distancing"" applies to hand-holding. Or how to know if (or when) it's safe to kiss someone. Tinder's ""distancing"" caution specified ""public gatherings,"" but what about private gatherings?
That's tens of millions actively wondering right now: is novel coronavirus similar to other STDs? Like, even if you wore sexy rubber catsuits and kept your bits covered in latex, can anyone bang safely right now? Is this the AIDS epidemic all over again, where the desire for sex is reviled like having a death wish? What horrible future are we in now that all dating has become... teleconferencing?
More to the point, we have to wonder if coronavirus infections will spread because Big Tech is too scared to talk plainly and non-judgmentally about COVID-19, human desire, and sexual communication.
""If dating apps wanted to follow the protocols of the adult industry,"" explained Free Speech Coalition Communication Director Mike Stabile, ""they should realize that, in a public health crisis, they are a unique portal to the population and can be an effective way to communicate information.""
When the adult industry sees a potential risk to the performer pool, we shut down PASS — the performer testing system — to alert performers and producers that there is a production hold.
The adult industry has survived and thrived precisely because we do talk about sexual health and safety constantly. Society needs to learn to talk about sexual risk in a way that's not stigmatizing or accusatory, but as medical fact.
""Not everyone reads the news or is on social media,"" Stabile added. ""We all have our part to play.""
Can't swipe it away
Like everyone else, adult performers and other sex industry workers are concerned about coronavirus transmission risks. The Free Speech Coalition posted a porn-industry-specific COVID-19 advisory last week, describing new behaviors to adopt for coronavirus safety in a sexual atmosphere. ""In some ways, this is familiar territory for us,"" explained FSC's Stabile. ""Despite the intimate nature of our business, our sets are smaller and crew are already trained in safe handling of bodily fluids.""
If only the stewards of bazillion-dollar tech apps were as innovative and efficient as the sex industries they exclude and erase at every turn. ""The adult industry is used to talking about risk-mitigation, and already have an infrastructure set up with health and testing protocols,"" Stabile said, noting that all performers are notified en masse when there's a health risk to the population, and doesn't generalize about it in a quick pop-up linking to the WHO.
Bumble's upsell to its videoconference product, by comparison, was crass and a missed opportunity to say why safer coronavirus sex matters now more than ever. FSC told Engadget that ""some performers are already shifting toward more self-produced content, cams and solos."" And this is exactly how wider sex work communities are shifting as the business of sexual intimacy meets stark COVID-19 transmission concerns for both workers and their clients.
""On Tuesday,"" wrote an anonymous sex worker, ""politician Lord Bethell spoke in the House of Lords about the risk of transmitting coronavirus through kissing and other forms of social intercourse, saying: ""Kissing is wonderful but potentially dangerous."" As an in-person sex worker, this isn't good for business.""
Former full-service sex worker and author of the Thriving in Sex Work series Lola Davina told Engadget via email, ""Any time social distancing is the solution to a problem, contact sex workers, including strippers, masseuses/masseurs, professional dominants, and full service sex workers will be hit hard.""
Evolving faster than tech companies, online workers are stepping up to coach others to find new, non-contact ways to get the job(s) done. And while the Senate GOP blocked an emergency paid sick leave bill intended to deal with the fallout of coronavirus, the Sex Worker Aid Initiative of Seattle sprang into action and launched a ""COVID19 #MutualAid fund and emergency response for affected community members.""
Dating apps could learn a lot from sex workers about what to say to their 77 million scared and horny users -- all of whom are at risk now. Writer and performer Lorelei Lee offers cleaning details revealing that a BDSM dungeon is probably one of the lowest-risk locations you could find yourself in a pandemic. New York based escort fera lorde spelled it all out in an informative Twitter thread. ""We already use (sometimes medical grade) sanitation products for laundry, surfaces, doorknobs, toys, hands – you name it. I've never worked in an incall that didn't have a plethora of sanitation products and antibacterial soap/hand sanitizer on hand and stocked up...""

I wanted to address this because clients are *blowing me up* about it - so here we go!

— fera lorde (@feralorde) March 10, 2020
Needless to say, coronavirus safety advice to 77 million people using your app to hook up is quite different than advice for going to Trader Joe's and panic buying all the frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken. Especially when you consider that the pandemic and quarantine is now projected to have a massive sexual impact on the general population.
A pandemic in your pants
This week, San Francisco AIDS Foundation posted a very detailed information page about steps to prevent novel coronavirus — far more on social distancing than Tinder's pop-up. UCSF posted really helpful notes from its expert panel on COVID-19, explicitly stating that routes of infection occur in three ways: ""Hand to mouth / face; Aerosol transmission; and, Fecal oral route.""
The Guttmacher Institute looked at the bigger picture, detailing expected outcomes of current response and our certain sexual doom in its COVID-19 outbreak post, Potential Fallout for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights.
""Unlike the Zika virus outbreak,"" Guttmacher wrote, ""where sexual and mother-to-infant transmission were well-established, much less is known today about these potential transmission routes for COVID-19."" That sounds to me like something every horny app user on Earth should know right now.
Further, Guttmacher detailed:
At the health system level, we may see shortages of medications—such as contraceptives, antiretrovirals for HIV/AIDS and antibiotics to treat STIs—due to disruptions in supply chains overall.
...health authorities have recommended that people stock up ... items like oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch and ring, condoms, spermicide and lubrication will be important items on that list. However, building that stockpile might be difficult because of supply shortages and insurance practices that often limit reimbursement to just one month of prescription drugs at a time.
So while some joke on social media about all the COVID-19 babies we'll be seeing in December, everyone else who works in sexual health is deeply, terribly worried about a certain spike in STDs and STIs. It's one thing if dating and hookup apps could let everyone know that kissing, and yes, banging, is a way you can become a vector to accidentally infect your grandma with coronavirus. But it seems equally urgent for Big Tech to tell thirsty users that most condoms are made in China, there are predicted birth control pill shortages, as well as meds to deal with sexually transmitted infections and diseases.
Also, lots of unwanted pregnancies. And there's a chance diseases like HIV could become lethal once again as the availability and access to PreP and antivirals dry up.
Plus, while Trader Joe's was getting its shelves wiped clean in San Francisco this week, I noticed that Bed Bath and Beyond was seeing its shelves of condoms diminish -- and that was Thursday.
Thirsty for the truth
As a trained sex crisis counselor (and a training speaker for sex-ed peers), the ways in which dating and hookup apps are worsening the coronavirus by being sex-phobic bystanders makes me want to scream, or fill the interior of a Bumble executive's Tesla with inferior lube, or set Home Alone style dildo traps throughout Tinder's offices. Something, anything, to make them wake the hell up. Talking about coronavirus and sex isn't going to kill business, but not talking about it certainly will kill someone.
Ultimately, sex and the pandemic is all about harm reduction. Know the risks: Specifically, how transmission occurs, and how that fits into what you'd like to do. Make the best decision for your individual situation that reduces as many risks as possible for you, your sexytime partner(s), and the people you care about.
One way you might reduce your risks is by not taking any — like worldwide sex party club Kinky Salon. This week the club notified its happy-go-pervy patrons that in-person events were on hold indefinitely. ""Let's face it,"" they wrote in a mass email, ""no amount of hand washing will work when we're all making out with each other!""
It's okay if you don't want to deal; it's perfectly okay to put your sex life on hold until this intense storm passes. Just make sure your idea of 'not dealing with it' doesn't include ignoring your risks (and how you might put others at risk) if you decide to get down.
The discussions of sex, dating, tech, and COVID-19 will continue for a long time to come. It's up to us to make sure they keep happening — especially when hookup and dating apps act like keeping users informed and alive is simply ""not their department.""

It's going to be pandemonium when they try to reinforce these rules.
If you happened to watch the president's second swing at addressing the coronavirus outbreak on Friday afternoon, I'm sorry but that's time you simply won't ever get back.

Yes, granted, the XBox One X will soon be obsolete but for roughly a third the cost of an upcoming PS5 you can land a current gen system and enough games to get you through the next few weeks of quarantine.
Even as people shut themselves away from the world, they've still gotta eat. And with cities like NYC forcibly reducing dine-in service by up to 50 percent, much of that demand will be handled by take-out and delivery services. GrubHub normally takes up to 30 percent of an order's total from the restaurant as a commission. However the company announced last week that it is temporarily suspending those charges until we get a handle on this outbreak.

While the $5 Pi Zero is the company’s least powerful computer (it features a single core, 1.0 GHz CPU and 512 GB of RAM) it still has enough juice to control the relatively simple computing tasks of a ventilator.
Another reason Raspberry Pi boards are ideal for ventilators is the company’s ability to supply them quickly. Eben Upton, CEO and Founder of Raspberry Pi told Tom’s Hardwarethat, “Raspberry Pi ‘builds to stock’ rather than ‘building to order,’ so we generally have products either on-hand or in the pipeline with short lead times.” The company made 192,000 Pi Zero and Pi Zero W boards in the first quarter of 2020, but is aiming to produce 250,000 of them in the second quarter of the year.

It's available in rural areas, but patients needed to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Now, patients will be able to access telehealth at home and from anywhere in the country.
Patients and clinicians will need a two-way visual and voice connection, and standard copays and deductibles will apply. Though, healthcare providers may be able to waive or reduce cost-sharing for telehealth.
The risk of serious illness from the coronavirus is much higher for older people and those with underlying health conditions, so keeping those populations at home while still providing healthcare makes sense. Now, older patients with diabetes, for instance, won't have to postpone routine visits, and if a patient is concerned they may have the coronavirus disease, they can consult with their doctor via telehealth.
This policy change is made possible by a waiver of Medicare rules authorized by Congress, as well as emergency declarations made by the Trump administration. The expanded telehealth coverage will remain in effect during the outbreak, but this could be an important step toward making remote healthcare more widely available in the future."

Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Director, Earth System Branch in WMO’s Infrastructure Department believes that the impact of losing those aerial observations will still be “relatively modest.” However, he explained in a recent press release, “as the decrease in availability of aircraft weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts.”
“The same is true if the decrease in surface-based weather observations continues, in particular if the COVID-19 outbreak starts to more widely impact the ability of observers to do their job in large parts of the developing world. WMO will continue to monitor the situation, and the organization is working with its Members to mitigate the impact as much as possible,” he continued.
More immediate is the problem with the system’s aircraft-based sensors; primarily that they’re no longer in the sky, collecting vital ambient temperature, wind speed and direction readings. Aircraft rely on the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program (AMDAR) to collect the necessary data using onboard sensors, process and transmit it to relay stations on the ground via radio or satellite link. 
“More than 3,500 commercial aircraft normally provide over 250 million observations per year,” a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson told Engadget. “Throughout the flight path… these aircraft provide pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction, and in some cases humidity.”
The COVID-19 crisis has severely curtailed the commercial air travel industry. According to FlightRadar24, commercial traffic declined by 4.1 percent year-over-year in February followed by a 21.6 percent YOY drop in March. We could potentially see an overall 8.9 percent reduction of global air traffic compared to last year, according to one Bloomberg analyst. 
“As of March 31, the daily output of meteorological data from U.S. commercial aircraft has decreased to approximately half of normal levels,” the NOAA rep continued. They were also quick to point out that “even though a decrease in this critical data will possibly negatively impact forecast model skill, it does not necessarily translate into a reduction in forecast accuracy since National Weather Service meteorologists use an entire suite of observations and guidance to produce an actual forecast.”
However, a 2017 study conducted by NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory suggests that including aircraft-based data reduces six-hour forecast errors in wind, humidity and temperature by up to 30 percent in the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model for North America. As such, ""we would expect some decrease in skill at least in some specific situations from the [current] decline in aircraft data volume,"" Stanley Benjamin, the study’s co-author, told Weather.
A separate study conducted at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) found that eliminating aircraft data from their models reduced the accuracy of Northern Hemisphere jet-stream level forecasts by 15 percent and 3 percent for surface pressure. What’s more, as of February, the National Weather Service reports that it is only incorporating around 65 percent of the aircraft-based observations into the GSF model that it normally does. 
""We are anticipating the substantial reduction in the availability of US AMDAR data to continue over the coming weeks, likely to generate some measure of impact on the output of our numerical weather prediction systems,"" Christopher Hill of the NOAA said in a March news release. That same release revealed that between March 3rd and March 23rd the number of aircraft reports over Europe received and used at the ECMWF dropped 35 percent with a 42 percent reduction, globally.
Thankfully, meteorologists won’t be flying completely blind with so many airlines effectively out of commission. The ECMWF began pulling wind data from the Aeolus satellite in January. As for the NOAA, “while the automated weather reports from commercial aircraft provide exceptionally valuable data for forecast models, we also collect billions of Earth observations from other sources that feed into our models, such as weather balloons, surface weather observation network, radar, satellites and buoys,” the spokesperson told Engadget. “Additionally, NOAA will soon be using COSMIC-2 GPS radio occultation satellite data to further increase observations throughout the depth of the tropical atmosphere.”"

Google says it saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams just in the past week. Thats on top of the more than 240 million daily spam messages it sees related to the novel coronavirus, the company says. 
The phishing attacks and scams use both fear and financial incentives to create urgency to try to prompt users to respond, Google says. In other words, same email scam, different subject line. 
These scams include impersonating government organizations like the World Health Organization to try to solicit donations or trick users into downloading malware; pretending to have information about government stimulus payments; and phishing attempts aimed at workers who are working remotely. This scammer pretends to be affiliated with the recipients employer:
Google say its artificial intelligence-powered protections filter such threats, and that it blocks more than 99.9 percent of spam, phishing, and malware from reaching our users using AI and other techniques. The company also says it worked with WHO on implementing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to make it more difficult for scammers to impersonate the who.int domain and prevent legitimate emails from the WHO from being caught in spam filters.
The company says in many cases the malware and phishing threats arent new but just existing malware campaigns updated to exploit fear and confusion around COVID-19. The usual cautions apply: dont click links in emails you werent expecting, report phishing emails, and make sure a URL is legitimate before providing any information, since most scammers try to closely approximate real URLs."

A COVID-19 test administered in Montana.

Samples scraped from the back of patients noses and throats can now be bundled together and tested for the coronavirus in groups in one of the countrys biggest commercial labs. Quest Diagnostics, which handles tens of thousands of coronavirus tests each day, received authorization for the method, called pooled testing, from the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend. 
The strategy helps conserve resources by running multiple tests using the materials usually required for one. It could also help Quest avoid backlogs and move testing along more quickly. Right now, demand for testing is so high that it takes an average of seven days for Quest labs to get results to patients. 
However, the strategy cant clear all testing roadblocks, and it may not work as well in the areas where its most needed: outbreak hotspots, where testing resources are stretched the thinnest. In those environments, where a high percentage of tests turn out to be positive, pools dont end up saving materials too many are positive, which means more retesting. 
When the positivity rate is high, pooling is not very effective.
When the positivity rate is high, pooling is not very effective, because youre splitting apart way too many pools, and its just not worth your effort, says Peter Iwen, director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory.
Quests method will combine samples taken from four people. If the multi-sample test is negative, all four are considered negative. If its positive, each sample gets retested on its own to figure out who has the virus. The company said in a press release that it will start rolling out pooled testing at its labs in Chantilly, Virginia, and Marlborough, Massachusetts, by the end of the week, before expanding to other locations. Quest did not respond to a request for comment. 
Experts have been interested in pooled testing for months. The method is already commonly used to screen people for sexually transmitted infections, and its used to check for diseases in donated blood as well. Deborah Brix, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told an American Society for Microbiology conference last month that the strategy could dramatically increase the number of tests done in the US each day. 
Back in March, Iwen started exploring pooled tests in the Nebraska Public Health Lab. He was running low on the chemicals needed to run each test and knew that he could conserve them by grouping samples together. He ran some experiments and found that he could do it successfully. It works great, and I can save anywhere from 60 to 70 percent of our reagents, he says. He got approval to move forward from Nebraskas governor under their state of emergency. 
We started pooling, and we were able to keep the lab operating, Iwen says.
Shortages of testing materials is just the type of roadblock a pooled testing strategy can help overcome, says Nikhil Gopalkrishnan, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvards Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. But supply shortages arent the only issue holding up testing. Depending on what the actual problem is, pooling can make a real impact, or it could not, he says. If it turns out that theyre short staffed, and they just dont have enough people, and the limiting factor is that someone has to unscrew all the tubes pooling is not going to help you there. 
Depending on what the actual problem is, pooling can make a real impact, or it could not.
Pooling also doesnt help once the rate of infections in a community starts ticking up. Iwen had to stop using pooled testing in the Nebraska lab a few weeks back because the percentage of tests that came back positive was too high above 10 percent. In any random group of four or five tests, there was a high chance that one would be positive. If the positive rate is that high, pooling doesnt tend to save a significant amount of chemicals or time. 
The new instructions for the Quest pooled testing say that, if 13 percent of tests done at a lab are coming back positive, the lab should drop the pool size down to three. If 25 percent of a labs tests are coming back positive, they shouldnt do pooled testing. Virginia and Massachusetts, home to the first Quest labs set to use pooled testing, positivity rate is about 6 and 2 percent, respectively. In Arizona, one of the hardest-hit states, its around 24 percent. 
Its possible to make pooled testing work in an area with a high percentage of positive tests, Iwen says. If they have information about patients (if they have symptoms, where they live, where they work), they can classify them as high or low risk. You could pool the ones that you think are considered low risk. You could do that in any place, even if their overall rate is very, very high, he says. 
That only works if labs can get good demographic information on the samples theyre testing. But often, labs get samples and have no idea where they came from, Iwen says. 
Despite the limitations, Gopalkrishnan says that the Quest authorization is a good first step toward more widespread pooled testing. Hed like to see bigger pool sizes, particularly in areas where there isnt much spread of COVID-19. Bumping pools up to tens of samples, or as high as 100, could help labs move through samples even more quickly. I think youll see more pooling authorizations come in, he says. 
Iwen thinks that implementing pooled testing properly can help testing move more quickly. This is a process that needs to be considered if were going to do the testing thats been asked of the laboratories, he says. Turnaround time is important, if it has an impact on that, its worthwhile.

When bowling alleys and tattoo parlors reopened in Georgia on Friday, the pandemic was not over. It won’t be over when the stay-at-home order in Michigan (maybe) lifts on April 30th or if the stay-at-home order in the Bay Area actually ends on May 31st. 
The dates politicians are throwing around are not finish lines. They aren’t guesses at an end date for this pandemic, either. Shelter-in-place orders are just time-outs. We have no sure-fire treatments for the virus, no vaccine, and a limited supply of health care workers. To keep as many people alive as possible, we’ve done the only thing we can do to slow the spread: we’ve hid from each other.
The virus’s effects have not been, as some proposed, a great equalizer. The less you have, the harder you’re hit. The federal government has mostly failed at leading a coherent response to the pandemic. Doctors are clashing with the FBI over PPE, then running into the ER with whatever they can scrounge up. Governors are hitting up their private-jet-owner friends to have masks flown in from China to equip their hospitals. Nurses at other facilities are resorting to wearing garbage bags in an unsuccessful bid to avoid contracting the virus on the job. 
People who are already vulnerable are getting hit the hardest. Death rates have soared in black communities already slammed by other public health crises. On the Navajo Nation, experts worry that water shortages are contributing to the virus’s continued spread. The virus has raged through cramped homeless shelters and through the communities that can’t afford to distance themselves. “It’s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,” an ER doctor working in Elmhurst, Queens told The New Yorker. “People hear that term ‘essential workers.’ Short-order cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers—that is the patient population here.” In some US prisons, the vast majority of inmates are testing positive for the virus, leaving incarcerated persons in fear for their lives. One inmate, Sterling Rivers, grimly observed that “Our sentences have turned into death sentences” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Our failures around the coronavirus are systemic failures of public policy.
Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries

Those failures have left the health care system struggling to cope, plunged society into a well of uncertainty, and sent the economy cratering. Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries. Twenty-six million people have filed unemployment claims. 
And so some governors will call an end to stay-home orders in the hopes of resuscitating their economies. In Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee, that time came on Friday. Other states, like California and New York, are taking a longer view, gradually easing some restrictions on movement while enforcing new requirements — masks on, low temps, can’t lose. 
As cases decrease, restrictions will relax. But once we let our guard down, we’ll likely see resurgences of cases, once again straining health resources — leaving us with no choice but to close ourselves off again. That’s what’s happening in parts of China now, where new outbreaks of the same disease have emerged. The open-and-shut economy will likely continue as cases ebb and flow. 
There are paths to victory, but as Ezra Klein notes at Vox, “these aren’t plans for returning to anything even approaching normal.” Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don’t have yet. Scientific discoveries will help defeat the virus — but science can’t do it alone. Public policies will play a huge role, and even with firm health guidelines and speedy scientific developments, it will take longer than we want for us to truly eke out a win.
What does a win look like? It will take widespread tests of everyone who might be sick and careful quarantining of anyone who tests positive. It will take armies of contact tracers to trace down anyone who might have been exposed. These low-tech interventions are the best thing we’ve got while we give researchers the time they need to come up with other solutions.
Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors

Scientists will labor over vaccines and treatments, but the overwhelming majority of their trials will turn up nothing useful. They’ll also keep trying to understand the virus and our bodies’ complicated response to it, in the hopes of developing legitimate antibody tests. Eventually, we may discover something that destroys the virus without wrecking our bodies. But none of that is ready today.
The end is still likely to be a long way away, as journalist Ed Yong writes in The Atlantic: “The pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world.”
Consider this a rebuilding year. It might even turn into rebuilding years, depending on our progress. Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors. Even antibody testing isn’t ready to be called up to the big leagues, at least not yet. 
This is a long game, and focusing on the victory celebrations — like New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s plan to “throw the biggest, best parade to honor” health care workers — won’t get us to the end. 
If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed

If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed. We’ll feel defeated every time a drug fails in testing. We can’t let it get to us like that. The parades, the ballgames, the worship services that we’re looking forward to, those will be there once this is over. What we’ve got to ensure now is that when we get to reopening day — whenever it is — that our concert halls and stadiums and spiritual homes are filled with as many of our human siblings as we can possibly save. 
It still sucks when the goalposts move from April 15th to April 30th, then to May 15th. It feels like we’re Charlie Brown and the end to this is a football that Lucy keeps pulling away. But when it comes to the virus itself, the clock isn’t the statistic that matters. These are the ones that do: numbers of tests, numbers of new infections, and numbers of bodies in the morgues. 
When the numbers of tests go up and confirmed cases and deaths go down, then our playbook will change. But it won’t be the end of the fight — not yet. 
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars

We play this through to the end — there is no other option. Victory might look like a vaccine. It might look like a robust testing regime or a new treatment. It might look like us cobbling together a sense of normalcy and still watching for repeated outbreaks. Whatever form it takes, we’ll fight our way there with masks, thermometers, and soap, buying some time along the way. We’ll adjust our playbook as the virus adapts. We’ll position ourselves farther apart. We’ll do it again, and again when the next waves of this virus come. We will be exhausted when we get there, but we will get there. But if we don’t pace ourselves for the long haul, it will be that much harder to get through.
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars. All we can do is get through today, pushing our leaders to get the people on the front lines the resources and time they need to get us through this. We need politicians who will stop telling us the comforting things we want to hear and start acting to keep as many of us alive as possible."

 On January 8th, I asked The Verge’s science team to keep an eye on early reports of a new virus that had recently emerged in China. When I dropped an article about that new virus from The Washington Post in Slack, someone joked that 2020 was off to a strong start, clearly jinxing the entire year for the rest of humanity. Whoops. 
Jokes aside, this past decade

, six and a half months has featured a disturbing flood of terrible, horrible, no good, very bad news. More than half a year in and not only do we still not know when this will all end, we’re also seeing a tsunami of new cases in the US and record-high hospitalizations. 
There’s so much we still don’t know, but we do know that this is going to keep going for a long, long time. We’ve got to pace ourselves if we’re going to make it. That’s why we’re starting with a weekly format for this column instead of bombarding you with a daily dose of news. Hopefully we can give you some context for the big headlines and help you keep track of our collective scientific progress as we stumble our way toward the future. It’s still an experiment, but these are a few things we’ll keep an eye on:

Research

Most people in the United States are still highly susceptible to the coronavirus, CDC study finds: The actual number of coronavirus cases in the US might be anywhere from two to 13 times higher than the number of confirmed cases, a new report from the CDC estimated. Unfortunately, the study also found that most people in the country still don’t have antibodies, leaving them vulnerable to the virus. (Laurie McGinley / The Washington Post)

“This disease goes from nothing to death”

<ul>
<li>“Of all the viruses and outbreaks that I have been involved with over the last four decades, I have never seen a virus in which the spectrum of seriousness is so extreme. This disease goes from nothing to death! So that has really surprised me,” Anthony Fauci said in an interview in The New York Times this week. For context, some of the viruses Fauci has confronted include HIV, Ebola, and Zika. (Jennifer Senior / The New York Times)</li>

Studies provide glimpse at efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and CanSino: A top COVID-19 vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response and didn’t produce severe side effects, according to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet. The study focused on a vaccine candidate made by Oxford University and Astra-Zeneca and involved nearly 1,000 patients. Another study, also published in The Lancet, found that a vaccine produced by Chinese company CanSino Biologics produced an immune response but wasn’t as effective in people over age 65. Both drugs will now have to complete phase three trials and be tested on hundreds, if not thousands more people. (Matthew Herper, Damian Garde, and Helen Branswell / Stat) </li>

Some Vaccine Makers Say They Plan to Profit From Coronavirus Vaccine: Executives from pharmaceutical companies testified before Congress on Tuesday and four of them were optimistic that the world would have a vaccine by late 2020 or early 2021. Two, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, said they would produce the vaccine at cost. Another two, Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer, did not. (Katherine J. Wu / The New York Times)</li>
<li>
In related news: On Wednesday, Pfizer and German company BioNTech announced that they were jointly receiving $1.95 billion from the US government to develop 600 million doses of a vaccine. They join other companies who have already received commitments of federal funding. Moderna is getting $483 million, Johnson and Johnson is getting $456 million, and AstraZeneca is getting $1 billion.</li>
<li>
Notes of caution — While most of the executives put a rosy timeline before Congress, other experts are more skeptical. Fauci told The New York Times that families were not likely to see a vaccine until next year. “I think it’s going to be sometime in 2021. I don’t know whether that’s going to be the first quarter of 2021, the first half — it’s difficult to say,” Fauci said.</li>
</ul>
Immunology experts have also been cautious, and so have other pharmaceutical executives. “I think when people tell the public that there’s going to be a vaccine by the end of 2020, they do a grave disservice to the public,” Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said in an interview hosted by Harvard Business School last week. “I think at the end of the day, we don’t want to rush the vaccine before we’ve done rigorous science.”

Want to help researchers find a vaccine? The National Institutes of Health (NIH) created a new network called the COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) that will help connect volunteers with some of the large clinical trials that are needed to test potential coronavirus vaccines. 
“Each of the Phase 3 clinical trials that the COVPN will conduct will require thousands of volunteers,” NIH director Francis Collins said in a statement. “Community engagement, particularly with the communities most vulnerable to COVID-19’s severe outcomes, will be critical to the success of this research endeavor.” 
If you want to volunteer, you’ll be asked to complete a short survey of personal questions, including where you live. If you’re a good candidate for one of the many studies going on across the country, a researcher will reach out to you and give you more information on the study. You can then decide whether you want to participate.

President Donald Trump said hes taking antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine and zinc because he believes the drugs could prevent COVID-19. 
Heres my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it, he said today in a White House roundtable with restaurant executives. Trump said hes been taking the drugs every day for a week and a half and that he has not had any COVID-19 symptoms. People close to the president, including one of Trumps valets and Vice President Mike Pences press secretary, recently tested positive for the virus. 
Side effects include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness
There is still no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine can prevent someone from contracting or getting sick from the coronavirus. Its a possibility a number of research groups are running clinical trials to see if the drug could protect health care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus from getting sick but no data from those studies is available yet. 
Trump said hes following the lead of frontline workers. You look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative, he said. While there are clinical trials looking specifically at using the drug as a preventive for health care workers, it is still not clear how many health care workers are taking the drug. Side effects of hydroxychloroquine include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness.
Trump spent weeks promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His administration reportedly pushed the Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to authorize the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of the hospital, based on meager evidence. While early data showed that hydroxychloroquine may help some patients, additional studies found that it wasnt effective and could have dangerous side effects, especially in people with severe symptoms. Trump stopped touting the drug after that data was publicized. In April, the FDA warned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside the hospital or a clinical trial.
While Trump says that he is taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, that cant be independently verified. All the public has is his word, and neither henor his White House has been reliable sources of information during this pandemic. Among other things, Trump has spent the pandemic publicly recommending treatment strategies for COVID-19 based on limited evidence. In late April, he appeared to suggest that Lysol injections could cure the disease. No therapies have been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. 
At time of publication, more than 90,000 people in the United States have died of the disease.

This week, a person incarcerated in King County Jail in downtown Seattle was taken to the hospital after they were suspected of having the new coronavirus. The county says there are no cases currently in the jail, but the new virus remains a huge concern for correctional facilities, particularly in outbreak hotspots like King County. With 85 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the county is home to the largest known hotspot of cases of the new coronavirus in the United States. 
Its only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus enters a US jail or prisons, says Tyler Winkelman, co-director of the Health, Homelessness, and Criminal Justice Lab at the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute in Minneapolis. All prisons and jails should anticipate that the coronavirus will enter their facility, and they need to have plans for monitoring and treating anyone who has symptoms, he says.
People regularly cycle in and out of jails and prisons, people who work in them leave and return daily, and visitors regularly stream through. Viruses of all kinds have multiple entry points, and those that enter tend to spread fast. Outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in these facilities, and during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases.
We know the coronavirus spreads quickly in closed spaces, like cruise ships, nursing homes and jails and prisons, Winkelman says. Many people who are incarcerated also have chronic conditions, like diabetes or HIV, which makes them vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19. 
One way to reduce the impact of the virus on jails and prisons, Winkelman says, is to avoid holding people for low-level offenses. In Iran, officials temporarily released tens of thousands of people determined to not be a risk to the public from prisons in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. People who arent a risk to public safety shouldnt be held in a jail just because theyre not able to pay a bond, he says. We are increasing their health risk by keeping them, he says. This is a time to make sure we have as few people at risk as possible. 
In Sonoma County, California, the jail is screening people at booking for symptoms and asking them about their travel history and contact with people who may be sick. Those types of screenings are critical, Winkelman says. It is essential that correctional staff are working with officials to make sure no one ill is entering a facility.
Some jails and prisons in the US may be prepared to screen, monitor, and treat people suspected of having COVID-19. But others are far from equipped to handle it. Health care centers in correctional facilities are often substandard and understaffed, which may mean people held in them arent monitored regularly enough. Symptoms need to be addressed quickly, not once a week or twice a week, Winkelman says. Isolating people suspected of having the virus could also be a challenge in some facilities the Hennepin County jail has four isolation rooms and set up some spaces for quarantines, but other places might not have the same capabilities, he says. 
Homer Venters, former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system, wrote in The Hillthat jails and prisons need to prepare now. [They] need to have a plan in place to identify and house together people with suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 and those who are at high risk of serious illness if they become infected, he wrote. Many facilities struggled to do so during the outbreaks of H1N1, he said, because jails typically house people based on the level of security they need not their health status. 
Standard public health interventions, like flu shots, are even more important during disease outbreaks if fewer people get the flu, they can stay out of health care facilities and leave more resources available for those who really need it. We dont want there to be outbreaks of multiple illnesses at once, Winkelman says. Many jails and prisons, though, dont regularly provide flu shots. Over half of US jails did not receive H1N1 vaccines when they became available. Under 10 percent of people in Maine correctional facilities received flu shots in 2011, which contributed to outbreaks. 
People in jails and prisons also may not be able to regularly wash their hands, which may promote the spread of disease. Hand sanitizer, which contains alcohol, is usually considered contraband. 
COVID-19 outbreaks in and around jails and prisons dont just have health impacts for people within the justice system. If public health officials recommend that courts not meet during outbreaks, people might be held for longer than necessary. It might be challenging for people on probation to meet with supervisors or fulfill community supervision requirements if there are restrictions on movement in an area. It may also mean that there would be less programing and movement within a facility. Likely, at some point, visiting would be shut down, Winkelman says. That can increase isolation and anxiety during a period of incarceration.
Vulnerable communities like people held in prisons and jails are often most at risk during public health emergencies they have fewer protections from an outbreak, and may face more significant fallout from any disruptions in daily life. But protecting communities from infectious diseases means protecting everyone, including those who arent as able to protect themselves. Jail and prison health care is public health. Its community health, Winkelman says.

Image: Amazon
Amazon is building a lab to test its workers for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Its the latest effort by the company to protect workers who are growing increasingly panicked as the virus spreads through Amazon warehouses. 
More than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed cases in the US, according to data compiled by the Financial Times, several with multiple instances of the virus.
In a blog post announcing the effort, Amazon says that a shortage of testing capacity is making it difficult to keep people safe and to get the economy back up and running. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence, the company said. Unfortunately, today we live in a world of scarcity where COVID-19 testing is heavily rationed.
Amazon is reallocating its own specialists to build the lab, and hopes to begin testing soon. A team of Amazonians with a variety of skills from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers have moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative, said Amazon. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our front-line employees soon.
We are not sure how far we will get... but we think its worth trying
Amazon has remained open throughout the pandemic, making it easier for many people to safely follow shelter-at-home orders. But that has put hundreds of thousands of front-line warehouse workers and delivery drivers at risk. To meet surging demand, Amazon announced plans to increase pay and hire an additional 100,000 workers back in March. The company has also been distributing masks, conducting employee temperature checks, and spraying disinfectant on work stations.

Department of Health in Washington State has reported the first death in the U.S. related to the coronavirus. 
10 with 9 posters participating
Health officials in Washington state reported three grim new features of the coronavirus situation in the US Saturday. They reported the countrys first death, the first case in a healthcare worker, and the first possible outbreak.
In a press briefing held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer at Public Health of Seattle and King County, announced that there are three new presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the county, including the person who died. All of the cases appear to be from undetected spread of the new coronavirus in the community. The cases were identified because the state just recently gained the ability to do its own testing.
Two of the cases are linked to a long-term care facility called Life Care in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle. One of the cases is in a healthcare worker at the facility, a woman in her 40s who is said to be in satisfactory condition. She has no known travel outside of the US. The other is a resident of the facility, a woman in her 70s. She is in serious condition.The cases likely represent the start of an outbreak at the facility, which has approximately 108 residents and 180 staff. So far, 27 residents and 25 staff have reported some COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Duchin said.
An outbreak of COVID-19 at a nursing home is particularly alarming since the data on the disease so far has clearly shown that the people most at risk of getting infected and having life-threatening disease are the elderly and people with underlying health conditionssuch as cardiovascular disease, lung conditions, and diabetes.
We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, Dr. Duchin said.
A team from the CDC is on its way to the facility to help manage the situation. This team is expected to arrive in Kirkland Saturday night.
The countrys first reported COVID-19 death was also in King County. The person who died was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. He died in a local hospital in Kirkland, but he was not a resident at Life Care and has no immediately known links to the facility. Health investigators are trying to track down how he was infected. (In an earlier press conference, President Trump had identified the person who died as a woman. That is incorrect. It was a man.)
The new informationa rapid escalation of the situation in the USfollows news of potential community spread in four separate areas of the US: two areas in California, and one in Oregon in addition to the Seattle and King County area.
This escalation raises our level of concern about the immediate threat of COVID-19 for certain communities, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said in the briefing. Still, the risk to the general public not in these areas is considered to be low, she said.
The new information brings the countrys tally to 69 cases and one death. That includes 47 cases in repatriated citizens (44 from the Diamond Princess and 3 from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began)."

She then explained precautions like frequent hand washing, coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue, and avoiding close contact with anyone who has a fever and cough. 
Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, the WHO says. So far, it's responsible for 2,933 deaths worldwide. Health officials confirmed the first death from coronavirus in the United States on Saturday. The patient was in their 50s and ""medically high risk,"" President Trump said in a press conference. 
As The Verge reports, coronavirus misinformation thrives on TikTok, where memes about the virus abound. Users have pretended to be infected, and harmful stereotypes about people of Asian descent are on the rise. 
Joining TikTok is part of a global effort from WHO, the Centers for Disease Control, and other health organizations to inform the public about the coronavirus through social media outreach. On Instagram, WHO has been posting informational graphics and videos about ways to prevent and limit the spread of the virus.

By choosing the centralized approach, the NHS is aligning more with Australia than some of its EU counterparts. Australia’s app, which was released over the weekend, uses a mix of Bluetooth and stored contact data on both the app and servers. Germany, on the other hand, has switched its stance and is now pursuing a decentralized architecture, as are Austria, Estonia and Switzerland.

Google originally planned to bring necessary employees in on a “rotating basis,” with about 10 percent capacity. The company hoped to slowly increase that capacity to 30 percent by September. Google will likely take a similar, phased approach when it does eventually open, and it has promised “rigorous” safety measures.

This year's iPhones might not include a charger in the box
It may be for cost-cutting and environmental reasons.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who’s been correct pretty often in the past, claims that 2020 iPhone models will not only skimp on the usual headphones but won’t include the power adapter either — you may get just a charging cable. There would be a more powerful 20W charger (versus the 18W for the iPhone 11 Pro) made available, but you’d have to buy it after the fact.
Kuo believes this would be a way to cut costs and offset the higher price of 5G wireless technology. There would also be an eco-friendly hook. Environmental critics have argued that including power adapters is frequently a waste when many people have chargers from previous phones or will top up using their computers. I’ll admit to having too many (pretty useless) low-watt phone chargers — so this sounds like a good idea. Continue reading.

OnePlus’ incoming affordable phone may feature dual selfie cameras
Back to fundamentals.
When OnePlus entered the smartphone scene back in 2014, the company’s phones were some of the best value phones you could buy for a while. But that changed slowly — mostly with regard to prices, which have crept up each year. And now, the $899 OnePlus 8 Pro is only $100 less than the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20.
OnePlus is apparently going back to its roots, with a new, more affordable phone series. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said the company plans to introduce a new line initially in India and Europe before bringing it to North America. Spec-wise, rumors suggest a 32-megapixel main sensor and an 8-megapixel secondary sensor supporting a wide-angle lens. The Nord will house the cameras in a display cutout at the top-left corner of the screen. Dual front-facing cameras would be a first for OnePlus, mid-priced phone or not. Continue reading.

While critics say the centralized approach raises privacy concerns, NHSX CEO Matthew Gould told Reuters that the group “put privacy right at the heart” of the app. He explained that the app doesn’t know who users are, where they are or who they’ve been near. Britain’s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham pointed out that the centralized approach will allow the UK to gather more insights into the virus, something a decentralized approach might limit.

The company saw slumps in hardware sales almost across the board, but it reported a total of $58.3 billion in revenue -- just edging out its performance this time last year.
“Despite COVID-19’s unprecedented global impact, we’re proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter,” CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. 
Today’s results didn’t come out of the blue. Earlier this year, Apple confirmed to its shareholders that it would not meet its previous revenue guidance of between $63 billion and $67 billion because of a “slower return to normal conditions” than the company had anticipated. Cook noted today that, before the coronavirus had begun to reach massive proportions, Apple was expecting a highly successful quarter with revenue near the top of its guidance.
In this past quarter, Apple has continued with its work as best as possible and pushed forward with new product releases, including updated versions of the iPad Pro and MacBook Air. Those devices were released too late to have a significant impact on these results, though. Despite raking in $4.37 billion from its iPad business and $5.35 billion off Mac sales, the company still fell short of the watermark it set this time last year. Since it accounts for the majority of Apple's business, it's little surprise Apple's iPhone business took the brunt of the damage -- sales fell from $31 billion in the year-ago quarter to $28.9 billion this time. Apple didn't elaborate on the cause of this dramatic dip in its initial release, but soft sales in China and coronavirus-related production delays likely contributed to the situation. 
Despite these sales slumps, Apple did report a few successes in this quarter. The company's services business -- which has quickly become one of Apple's most crucial growth areas -- made all-time high $13.3 billion. Sales in Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories category surged slightly, too, generating $6.3 billion for the company. 
For now at least, Apple seems to be holding everything together quite well, but there's one important thing to remember: This is the last quarter on the books that wasn't completely influenced by the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. (Apple's Q2 started at the beginning of January 2020, before the coronavirus situation began to spiral.) As a result, the big changes we've all had to grapple with will be more fully reflected in the company's next earnings release. For instance, Apple closed all of its stores outside Greater China on March 13th, two weeks before the end of Q2. The effects of that decision will likely have a huge impact on Apple's next batch of financials, as will the new iPhone SE, which seems well-positioned to help Apple gain ground with value-minded consumers. For now, we'll have to see how things play out; Apple will certainly face questions about the future of its supply chains, production capability and new hardware development during its customary earnings call, and we’ll update this story with any notable tidbits."

Since late March, Yelp business pages have featured a COVID-19 banner in which businesses can communicate whether they’re temporarily closed, if they’ve adjusted their hours and how they’re operating. Now, the banner has been expanded to the “COVID-19 business updates section,” allowing businesses to share significantly more information. A business can post any updates to service, such as if it’s offering dine-in service, curbside pickup, or both. Businesses can also use the banner to inform customers of any safety measures they’re enacting, such as “enforcing social distancing, sanitizing between customers, mandating staff wear masks and/or gloves, providing hand sanitizer or contactless payment, and more.”"

We’ve asked Amazon for comment. In a statement to CNBC, it maintained that it followed all national and local health guidelines, including the CDC’s contact tracing approach. The firm reviews camera footage, checks where people were present and conducts interviews, according to a spokesperson. It also insisted that it immediately alerts all workers if there’s a positive case, and that it was up to employees to disclose if they tested positive.
Critics have already contended that Amazon’s approach isn’t enough, though, and doesn’t meet CDC guidelines despite claims to the contrary. Warehouse footage only covers 24 hours (not the 48 hours needed for CDC tracing) and likely doesn’t include high-contact areas like washrooms. It would also break CDC guidelines if it discouraged staff from revealing positive test results. As in the past, then, there appears to be a gap between what Amazon says it’s doing to protect workers and what people say is happening."

To predict the outcome of the 2020 MLB season, Unanimous recruited 40 fans from around the country. “We captured their knowledge, wisdom, insight and intuition, in real time,” Rosenberg explained, “and allowed them to converge on these forecasts.” Those forecasts were then fine tuned using historical matchups and stats. 
Unanimous’ baseball predictions last year were accurate roughly 59 percent of the time, a significant advantage over the 55 percent success rate that professional handicappers typically achieve against the Vegas bookmakers. “So far this year in other sports we've been doing we've been over 60 percent accurate,” Rosenberg noted. “So, we’re really happy with how the system is getting even more accurate.”
The wrinkle for this year, however, is that the season is only 60 games long, rather than the standard 162. “It's hard to know if that'll help us or hurt us,” Rosenberg conceded. ”Vegas will probably struggle a little bit more than usual this year because they base their forecasts so much on pure mathematical models and previous years of baseball. Whereas our technology does use historical data but it's also capturing a real time sentiment, the knowledge and wisdom and insight of people.”
As such, Unanimous AI expects the Dodgers, Yankees, Twins and Astros to all win their respective divisions by wide margins, though it will be interesting to see how the Astros manage to pull that feat off without the stadium’s crowd noise to cover up the sound of their trash cans banging. The National League East and Central divisions are much more competitive, with the Nationals and Cardinals expected to narrowly beat out their respective challengers. 
Similarly, the company believes that the Dodgers will win the National league pennant and make it to their third World Series in four years. The Yankees have a similar advantage in the American League, though Atlanta, Minnesota, Houston, Oakland and Tampa Bay all appear in position to give New York a run for its money.
Should these predictions hold true, Unanimous’ AI predicts the Dodgers and Yankees will meet up for their 12th World Series faceoff. The Yanks have a chance to win it all for the first time since 2009 while the Dodgers might finally get to take home some hardware on their seventh try. That said, Unanimous did bet on the Astros winning out last year, just before the Nats caught fire and roundly pounded Houston over the course of sixty-three soul-cleansing innings."

The cancellation of large gatherings in confined spaces was announced by Health Minister Olivier Veran after special government meetings Saturday that focused on responses to the epidemic.
Having previously recommended that people avoid shaking hands, the minister said they should also cut back on “la bise,” the custom in France and elsewhere in Europe of giving greetings with kisses, or air kisses, on the cheeks.
The tightened restrictions on public gatherings had an immediate impact. A major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors was postponed from March to June.
A half-marathon that was scheduled for Sunday in Paris also was cancelled, as was a carnival in the Alpine town of Annecy, Veran announced.
He said other outdoor events and gatherings that might lead to a mixing of people from infected areas could also be canceled.
Public gatherings are being banned completely in the Oise region north of Paris that has seen a cluster of cases, and in a town in the foothills of the Alps that has also seen infections, he said.
As of Saturday, France had registered a total of 73 people infected with the coronavirus, up from 57 on Friday. Of those, 59 people remain hospitalized, two have died and 12 have recovered, the minister said.

Former intelligence contractor and whistleblower Reality Winner has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. Winners sister, Brittany Winner, tweeted her diagnosis earlier today. Winner is currently incarcerated in a federal medical prison in Fort Worth, Texas, where an outbreak has sickened hundreds of inmates and killed atleast two.
Winner is seeking compassionate release during the coronavirus pandemic, citing underlying medical conditions. An early petition for release from her imprisonment at FMC Carswell was denied in April. Shortly afterward, Carswell reported its first coronavirus death: Andrea Circle Bear, who died after giving birth on a ventilator. The Fort Worth Star-Telegramreported last week that 130 people had contracted COVID-19 at the prison; the most recent Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics show over 500 cases. An appeal is currently pending.
Email from Reality: ""Officially Covid-19 positive. I am being retaliated against harshly for articles last week and am about to take admin remedies."" ALSO, the guard CONGRATULATED her for testing positive. Help us get her out. Please RT! #CompassionateRelease4Reality
 Brittany Winner, PhD (@WinnerBrittany) July 20, 2020
Winners attorney, Joe Whitley, told Law.comsDaily Report that he hopes the court will take the outbreak into consideration. I hope the BOP is equipped to handle the geometric surge in cases, effectively at all their facilities, but I am concerned that may not be the case. According to Daily Report, Winners sister says she is currently asymptomatic, and one of her cellmates also tested positive.
Prisons have emerged as one of the most dangerous hotspots for Americas coronavirus outbreak. Attorney General William Barr has ordered prisons to prioritize releasing inmates to home confinement, but numerous reports have demonstrated confusion and delays in the process although some high-profile Trump associates, like Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, have been released.
Winner, who previously worked for the National Security Agency, accepted a plea deal for espionage in 2018 after leaking a report on Russian election interference to The Intercept. She is currently scheduled for release in November 2021."

The rings aren't exactly comprehensive trackers, but they do record body temperature, heart rate and other vitals. In the near term, they could alert medical workers if they have a fever or impending illness, not just COVID-19. By the fall, when some expect the coronavirus to resurge, UCSF and Oura hope to have an algorithm that will detect early symptoms of the virus, so that people can more effectively self-quarantine.
One of the strategies at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, was to have residents report their temperatures daily and isolate at the first sign of fever. The ring could allow users to do the same. But it would require that they hand over medical data, which opens up data privacy concerns.
There is some indication that this could work, though. Thanks to the Oura Ring, a Finnish business executive noticed that his temperature was higher than normal (about 100.4 Fahrenheit) and his heart and breathing rates were slightly increased. While he reportedly felt normal otherwise, he had just been traveling in a coronavirus hotspot, so he was tested. The results were positive for COVID-19. Without the ring, he wrote on Facebook, he would not have noticed those changes."

Priority will be given to areas with high rates of COVID-19, as well as traditionally underfunded healthcare providers like clinics in poor neighborhoods, TechCrunch notes.
""With the adoption of the $200 million COVID-19 Telehealth Program, the FCC can now take immediate steps to provide funding so that more patients can be treated at home, freeing up valuable hospital beds for those who most need them and reducing the risk of exposure to the virus,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.
The FCC approved the funding less than a week after it was announced. But the price for that speed may be a lack of guidance. ""This is a well-intended effort, but it lacks clear performance metrics,"" wrote Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who mostly spoke in favor of the program. ""Moreover, it does not focus on a specific problem in healthcare,"" she added.
The FCC also adopted rules for the Connected Care Pilot Program, a separate, three-year initiative that will provide up to $100 million to help offset the cost of providing virtual care. One goal of the pilot is to determine how the FCC's Universal Service Fund might be used to support long-term telehealth. In particular, that program will emphasize providing care to veterans and low-income Americans.
In light of the coronavirus, Medicare has expanded telehealth coverage nationwide. While Medicare previously covered telehealth in some rural areas, patients still had to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Now, millions of older adults will be able to seek medical advice from the safety of their homes, and with this FCC funding, more healthcare providers will be equipped to provide it."

MIT researchers think they have a solution with few compromises. They’re developing a system, PACT (Private Automatic Contact Tracing), that promises to automatically trace contacts while keeping identities secret.
The system would send Bluetooth “chirps” of random numbers to nearby phones. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload all their received chirps from the past 14 days (about the maximum incubation time) to help others find out if they were close by. If there’s a match between numbers, the passers-by get notifications telling them of possible contact and what to do next. The very nature of the process continuously changes IDs, making it difficult or impossible to link data to a given individual.

Amazon has declined to comment, while Abbott and Thermo Fisher haven't addressed the report so far.
If accurate, the scoop suggests that Amazon is aware of how important it is to keep infected workers out of its warehouses, whether or not recent protests influenced its thinking. Amazon has increasingly become important during the pandemic as a way to shop for food, health supplies and other necessities without leaving home. Even one infection at a warehouse (19 warehouses have had incidents so far) could leave people without vital goods for a while if it prompts a temporary closure.
At the same time, this also hints that Amazon still has a long way to go before it has a complete defense against COVID-19. The outbreak has already been present in the US for weeks, and Amazon is only just implementing face masks and temperature checks. Even if test supplies weren't a factor, the pandemic could be at or past its peak before warehouse staff have assurances that their coworkers are healthy."

AT&amp;T is taking a slightly different approach, removing usage caps. Until now, some customers have seen usage caps ranging from 150 GB to 1 terabyte per month, Motherboard explains. Users who surpassed those limits could be penalized $10 per additional 50 gigabytes, or more. It's unclear if those caps will come back when the pandemic settles down.
We may see more ISPs taking action to improve internet speeds, access and usage soon. Today, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called on the FCC to take aggressive action in response to COVID-19. We don't know yet what that will look like, but if AT&amp;T and Comcast are any indication, it could include a push to increase speeds and lift data caps.
As a result of the #coronavirus people across this country are going to be asked to move work and learning online. So NOW is a really good time for the FCC to take action to get our nation's broadband providers to lift data caps and remove overage fees. https://t.co/1qJV7whVsR

Netflix on Thursday announced the launch of a unique Stranger Things immersive theater production its calling a drive-into experience, in which its transforming a series of buildings in downtown Los Angeles into what is effectively a cross between a theme park and a live theater show. The central hook: you can drive your car through the entire thing and never have to get out. It sounds like a savvy way to capitalize on the hunger for live events during the pandemic while trying to give people an experience thats safe and sensibly designed. 
The company says it will be featuring iconic locations from the show, including the newly opened Starcourt Mall, the secret underground Russian lab, and the supernatural Upside Down from the shows third season, which debuted last summer. You wont have to leave your car, but there will be moments when you can stop to watch various actors in scenes that happen concurrently, in the style of influential immersive theater productions like Sleep No More. (Realistically, its probably more like your standard haunted house or walk-through theme park experience.) 
A live Stranger Things event designed to be safe during the pandemic
Netflix is partnering with event platform Fever and creative production company Secret Cinema, the same company that helped it stage a Hawkins High School Reunion in the UK, to pull everything together. 
The beloved Netflix original series, created by The Duffer Brothers, will be transformed into an immersive theatrical production, complete with mind-bending sets, actors in costume, and otherworldly special effects. Upon entry, guests will drive their vehicles (in groups of 24 cars) through the multi-level experience, stopping for extended periods of time for scenes to play out around them, the announcement reads. They will then be guided to drive to the next scene, where they park again for another chapter in the story.
Netflix says tickets will go on sale starting Wednesday, August 26th, with pricing starting at $59 per car. It says there will be a variety of packages available, although its unclear what other price tiers may be available or what else Netflix may bundle alongside the cost of admission."

Image: Netflix
Netflix has canceled its adaptation of Altered Carbon after two seasons, according to Variety, marking the end of yet another big-budget adaptation for the streaming service. 
According to Deadline, the cancellation was decided back in April, and was made for the companys usual cost / benefit reasons. In other words, Altered Carbons fate isnt apparently COVID-19 related as has been the case with other recent Netflix cancellations, like The Society and I Am Not Okay With This, both of which hadsecond season plans nixed due to circumstances created by COVID, according to a Netflix statement at the time. 
The fact that Altered Carbon got the axe isnt too surprising
The fact that Altered Carbon got the axe isnt too surprising, though. The show debuted in 2018 as a marquee series for Netflix: a gritty, adult sci-fi series based on a popular series of novels with a sky-high budget (season one star Joel Kinnaman described it as a bigger budget than the first three seasons of Game of Thrones), big action sequences and bigger philosophical issues about what it meant to be human. 
Unfortunately, the show debuted to middling praise, and while it clearly did well enough that Netflix was willing to roll the dice on a second season (which debuted earlier this year), the series clearly was hit with a smaller budget for its second time around, with fewer episodes and less flashy sets and effects but if anything, the second season made even less of an impact. Altered Carbon just wasnt going to be the next Game of Thrones, which meant that Netflix wasnt going to keep spending HBO-levels of money on it. 
Its a cycle reminiscent of Altered Carbonspreceding big-budget sci-fi Netflix series: Sense8, which cost an estimated (and eye-watering) $9 million per episode, making it one of the most expensive TV shows ever made before it was also canceled by Netflix after two seasons. 
But unlike Altered Carbon, Sense8 had garnered a deeply dedicated fanbase which, while apparently not big enough to justify the continued expense of the show on Netflixs accounting sheet, was enough to get the streaming company to bring the series back for a final two-hour special to wrap up the series. 
In the earlier days of Netflixs original content empire, the streamer was far more likely to keep shows around for several seasons, content to give each series the chance to find an audience over time. But as Netflixs output has exploded from a handful of shows and films to hundreds, theres far more competition and a much lower bar for success. The result is that more Netflix originals especially expensive ones like Altered Carbonhave been canceled after just a season or two."

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
The Presidential elections are nearly upon us. Amidst all the crises that we are now experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental emergencies, protests against racism, and an extraordinarily divided electorate it is vital that, if you are a US citizen and 18 years of age or older, you make use of your vote.
Along with all the other upheavals were dealing with, the very process of voting has come into contention. While many voters are anxious to get their ballots in, they dont want to expose themselves to possible infection in small, crowded voting areas, so voting by mail has become the main alternative. But many of us are not familiar with that process, especially because a number of states have been adjusting their rules to allow as many people to vote by mail as possible. Add to that the recent political cockfights over the administration of the US Post Office and the electioneering over the legitimacy of vote-by-mail, and you have a recipe for complete confusion. 
So what do you do? Well, you do your research.
To begin with, when you can vote and how you can vote depends on which state you live in. Some states already offer voting by mail and will send ballots to registered voters automatically. Others will allow you to vote by mail during this pandemic, but you need to apply for a ballot. And a few still demand that you have an approved reason (not including I dont want to catch a possibly fatal disease during a pandemic) to be able to obtain an absentee ballot.
So its important to make sure that (a) youre registered, (b) if you are voting in person, you know where to go, and (c) if you want to vote by mail, you know what the rules are in your local area and / or your state. And you want to do all this as soon as possible.
But what you do not want to do is get your information from a random tweet, or from your Uncle Al who heard it from a friend of his. Here are a few more reliable resources.
<ul><li>The official government site USA.gov has a drop-down menu that will take you to your states Board of Elections site. The Board of Elections is the best place to go for information about registering and voting.</li></ul>
USA.gov
<ul><li>According to its website, Vote.org is the largest 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-partisan voting registration and get out the vote (GOTV) technology platform in America. The site allows you to register to vote, check an existing registration, request an absentee ballot, and even get election reminders.</li><li>If you type how to vote in your Google search box, youll get information specific to the state that Google thinks youre in; theres a drop-down menu to change that. Youre probably safest if the link you click has a .gov domain, although since many states are using third-party services for registration and information, that isnt an absolute.</li><li>If youre unsure about any information you get, either online or off make a call. Yeah, its a bit old-fashioned, but if you feel that your local site is either not informative enough or confusing, you can call your local Board of Elections (the phone number will be on your state Board of Elections site). Of course, with offices closed all over the country due to COVID-19, it may be difficult to reach someone, but be persistent this is your vote, after all.</li></ul>A few more words of advice:
<ul><li>Be aware that even those who should know about the process involved may be confused. For example, when a staffer from The Verge called their local borough office of the NYC Board of Elections, the person who answered didnt know that NYC was now offering an online tool to apply for an absentee ballot. When the staffer tried calling the main NYC BoE office, the person at the other end of the line not only knew about the online application, but suggested that they register for the ballot both online and by sending in an application via regular mail. Either way, the person said, they will only get one ballot but at least the ballot would be more likely to arrive. The moral of the story? If youre unsure of the information youve received, try again.</li><li>When you get your ballot, read the instructions. Twice. And then check them once more when youve completed your ballot. Many states have complicated rules about how to fill out, sign, and send in an absentee ballot, and a single misplaced signature can mean your vote will not be counted.</li><li>Avoid filling out your ballot on the kitchen table, or anywhere else where a stray ketchup stain or a streak from your kids crayons might be an excuse for invalidation.</li><li>You cant vote often, but you should vote and apply for your absentee ballot as early as possible. On several of the official sites, I saw warnings about leaving plenty of time for applications and ballots to be delivered, even though some of the excitement surrounding the slow-downs at the United States Postal Service has died down. </li><li>And finally, you can always vote the old-fashioned way: at your local polling place. Check with your local Board of Elections as to where to go, and if you wish, call them to find out what precautions they are taking to protect voters from infection. </li></ul>But however you choose to vote, please do so. This year, more than any, its important."

The software uses Bluetooth LE to record when the user passes someone else who has the app installed on their phone. It also notes how long they've been near one another. Should a user of the app test positive for COVID-19, it will inform anyone they've been in contact with for longer than 15 minutes.

Besides low adoption, other issues may hamper the effectiveness of the app. Not all of Germany's clinics can transmit test results electronically. In those instances, people who test positive for COVID-19 will need to phone a national hotline to sync their apps properly. There's a worry some people may call the hotline to troll people who have the app installed on their phone. At launch, the software also isn't compatible with the contract tracing apps other European governments have deployed in their countries; roaming functionality is something Germany plans to add some time in the next few weeks. 
Still, a lot is riding on the success of the app. According to tracking by Johns Hopkins University, the country has had 188,213 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,814 deaths to date, meaning it has had both fewer cases and deaths than Italy and the UK. But with the government easing travel restrictions and events like IFA coming up, there's a chance for the coronavirus to flare up again."

The United States needed to reopen the economy. To a non-expert, the argument sounded compelling. The author, Silicon Valley growth hacker Aaron Ginn, used Johns Hopkins data to make his point. On Medium, the piece blended in with fact-checked articles from doctors and epidemiologists, until it was debunked in an eviscerating tweet thread by an actual infectious disease expert, Carl T. Bergstrom, a biology professor at the University of Washington. Shortly after, it was taken down. In many ways, this was Medium working as intended. The company operates both as a blogging platform and as a media outlet. Some articles, written by professional journalists who work at one of Medium’s publications, are fact-checked. Others are written by conspiracy theorists and contain dangerous misinformation. After all, the company’s mission, according to CEO Ev Williams, is to level the playing field and encourage “ideas that come from anywhere.” As the pandemic disrupts life in the US, Medium has made strides to stop the spread of misleading health news. Its own publications, like OneZero and Elemental, have covered COVID-19 with the journalistic ethics, editing, and fact-checking you’d expect from a traditional outlet. Medium also started an official COVID-19 blog to promote articles from verified experts. It rolled out a coronavirus content policy and hired a team of science editors. But the decision to curate some content — to hire professional journalists and promote verified articles — has made it harder to tell fact from fiction on the platform. While user-generated pieces now have a warning at the top telling users the content isn’t fact-checked, they look otherwise identical to those written by medical experts or reporters. In some ways, this is the promise of Medium: to make the work of amateurs look professional. Reading a 2,000-word article that contains misinformation about COVID-19 also seems notably different than reading a few of the same ideas in a tweet. It might not have mattered when Medium was a home for productivity hacks. But coronavirus misinformation could put people’s lives at risk. The situation has forced Medium to wade deeper into the waters of content moderation, where big tech firms have been floundering for years. Now, the platform that was built as a home for the world’s “unique perspectives” is in the position of deciding which perspectives actually matter. One of the most prominent voices on Medium about COVID-19 belongs to Tomás Pueyo, another Silicon Valley growth hacker. Pueyo wrote “Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,” which has over 40 million views, making it one of the most widely read articles about the virus. This is the best-case scenario for Medium. Pueyo is a credible non-expert who has a lot to say but no clear place to say it. Also, he can make sense of data. He learned how to read complex academic papers while building social apps in Silicon Valley. When the virus started to spread in the US, he immersed himself in Johns Hopkins’ repository on GitHub to figure out what was going on. Pueyo’s insight, which now seems obvious, was that novel coronavirus cases were growing exponentially. It was a pattern he recognized from when one of his apps had gone viral, adding 7 million users in three months. This comparison — viral apps to viral disease — would normally sound too convenient. This time, it actually worked. Pueyo argued on Medium that the coronavirus problem was worse and more immediate than most people knew or expected. Overnight, his article exploded. Andrew Yang shared it, as did the psychologist Steven Pinker. It was quoted in The New York Times. BuzzFeed called it the “defining piece on the outbreak of COVID-19.” The attention brought with it criticism, mostly focused on Pueyo’s background. He doesn’t have experience in epidemiology, and, to date, he has mostly built apps. One of these, Zoo World, helps people build virtual zoos. Asked about this feedback, however, Pueyo seems delighted. “It’s great!” he says. “You need the checks and balances, especially in my case, because I’m nobody. I have no training in epidemiology.” When A.J. Kay, an essayist in Tempe, Arizona, began learning about COVID-19 cases in the US, she didn’t think the information added up. It seemed off that the disease was being called “highly transmissible,” but only one person in Arizona person had it. (Testing for COVID-19 has notoriously lagged in the US, meaning that many people who may be sick with the disease aren’t counted in the official numbers.) Kay isn’t an epidemiologist. Until last month, her most popular article on Medium was about having her breast implants removed. But she grew more suspicious when her ex-husband lost his job at a local hospital. If there was such a shortage of health care workers, why on earth was one being fired? Also, her child support payments were now at risk. Kay compared the number of known COVID-19 cases with flu data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and came to a surprising conclusion: the virus had come to the United States far earlier than was previously reported. What people were predicting would be the peak — the menacing time when COVID-19 cases would overwhelm hospitals in cities across the US — was likely already happening. If she was right, the draconian measures state governments were enacting, like shutting down nonessential businesses, seemed woefully out of proportion with the problem. In the article, Kay admitted the situation was personal. Last year, she’d discovered she had a tumor in her liver but was told it was too low-risk to remove. Recently, she’d begun developing symptoms that seemed to indicate the disease was spreading. She needed to get a scan but couldn’t because the procedure was considered elective. If Kay could convince people that the virus wasn’t as bad as they thought, she might be able to finally address the problem. She also knew that her entire family had been extremely ill in early January. The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona was reported at the end of January. “I started putting things together in my head and I was like wait a minute…” she says. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth.” Her article, “The Curve Is Already Flat,” got 275,000 views in the first 48 hours it was published. Like Ginn’s piece, it fed into the conservative narrative that the mainstream media had gotten this wrong. Kay says she didn’t intend to take a political stand, but she was happy to see the article go viral. Two days after publishing, Kay received an email from Medium. “Due to elevated risk of potential harm to persons or public health, Medium’s Trust and Safety team has removed the following content,” it said. Medium had concluded that her article contained “health claims or advice which, if acted on, are likely to have detrimental health effects on persons or public safety.” A screenshot of the email Medium sent to A.J. Kay. Kay had watched a similar situation play out with Ginn. She’d liked his article, calling it the “first coronavirus piece that made sense” and was surprised when Medium took it down. Now, she felt like she was also being censored for refusing to play into the popular narrative. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth,” she says. Kay’s piece was quickly republished on a conservative blog, after receiving support from libertarian thinkers who derided Medium for censorship. An editor’s note at the top now reads: “This piece originally appeared on Medium.com and was removed without explanation or warning.” (Ginn’s piece was republished on a different conservative blog.) Medium’s communications team wouldn’t say how, exactly, the company decides to take an article down. They also declined to comment on how they discover misinformation on the platform and wouldn’t say how many people are tasked with finding and regulating content. When asked why, specifically, Kay’s piece was taken down, a company spokesperson sent over the COVID-19 content policy, declining to comment on specifics. Medium did say that it takes into account the newsworthiness of the piece as well as the “context and nature of the posted information, the likelihood and severity of actual or potential harms, and applicable laws” when deciding whether to take action. When asked about Ginn’s piece, Sandee Roston, the company’s head of communications, sent the following statement: We’re giving careful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content on Medium to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety. The Ginn post was removed based on its violation of our Rules, specifically the risk analysis framework we use for ‘ Controversial, Suspect and Extreme content.’ We’ve clarified these rules with our Covid-19 Content Policy to address more specific concerns around the evolving public health crisis, and we are actively taking down Covid-19 stories that violate this, such as the Kay piece. Part of the problem Medium is facing is that the situation is changing so fast. Information that seems true one day can quickly look wrong or out of date by the next. In February, the surgeon general told everyone to stop buying masks. Now, the CDC is urging everyone to wear cloth masks all the time. Journalism, by its nature, is rarely predictive. It tells people what’s true at the moment, often with a bit of analysis. “What seems to be true today may be wrong tomorrow,” wrote Charlie Warzel in The New York Times. BuzzFeed’s late-January article urging people to worry about the flu rather than the novel coronavirus looks laughable today — as does Vox ’s January 31st tweet saying the situation would not become a deadly pandemic. At the time, however, these ideas were the prevailing wisdom. In this period of uncertainty, Medium is giving people a place to speculate and offer concrete solutions — even if those solutions are unverified. For the writers, the stakes are low. If they’re wrong, most of the time, no one will notice. If they’re right, as Pueyo was, they could suddenly become an “expert” overnight. From that lens, Medium’s mission seems like a relic from another era, one where people believed giving everyone a voice on the internet would make the world a better place. Williams admitted as such when he spoke to The New York Times in 2017 about why he thought the internet was broken. “I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,” he said. “I was wrong about that.” It’s unclear how Medium solves that, and its opaque policies surrounding COVID-19 allow the company to enable the spread of misinformation while absolving itself of responsibility. Even Pueyo is self-aware of the platform’s dangers. When asked about people criticizing his article, he was okay with it: “I have no training in epidemiology,” he said. “You should definitely not trust me.”"

No one has it easy during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Amazon has it particularly hard. Google, Facebook, and Netflix all deliver their services over the internet, and a healthy amount of that work can be done from home. Amazon, by contrast, has taken on the job of delivering physical goods to our homes. At a time when tens of millions of Americans are isolated in their homes, Amazon has become a critical lifeline delivering food and supplies. But over the past several days, Amazon has begun to struggle under the weight.
The most significant news so far came Sunday night, when Jason Del Rey broke the news that Amazons famous two-day shipping for Prime members would now be delayed up to a month for non-essential items. Del Rey writes:
An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Recode on Sunday evening that the new April 21 delivery dates are not the result of a technical bug or error; they accurately reflect Amazons current reality.
To serve our customers in need while also helping to ensure the safety of our associates, weve changed our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes to prioritize stocking and delivering items that are a higher priority for our customers, the spokesperson said in a statement. This has resulted in some of our delivery promises being longer than usual.
At least Americans can still get non-essential items. (Which is to say, items outside the following departments: baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; groceries; and industrial, scientific, and pet supplies.) Thats not true in France or Italy any more, Krystal Hu reported at Reuters. The company has temporarily stopped taking orders for non-essential items that are shipped through its fulfillment service while it focuses on getting more important items to customers.
The company also suspended Prime Pantry, a service for getting rapid delivery of discounted grocery and household items, amid a surge in demand. And at the request of local governments it downgraded the quality of streaming on Prime Video in Europe in an effort to reduce the strain on the internet.
To be clear, Amazon has nothing to be ashamed of here. The company is navigating an extremely difficult period fraught with unpleasant trade-offs, and for the most part its supply chain has held up. The crisis has also spurred the company to (finally) recognize the everyday heroism of the workers in its distribution and delivery networks, who continue to put themselves at risk to keep America stocked up with necessities. As of Saturday, the company increased wages by $2 an hour and is offering double pay to workers who spend more than 40 hours on the job each week. And on Monday, the company finally agreed to provide paid time off for tens of thousands of warehouse employees.
Amazon has also said it will hire 100,000 new workers to help with increased demand amid the crisis, offering an equally important lifeline to a nation staring down the barrel of double-digit unemployment for the first time in recent memory.
In a memo to employees made public on Saturday, CEO Jeff Bezos said he is fully committed to addressing the COVID-19 challenge:
My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role. I want you to know Amazon will continue to do its part, and we wont stop looking for new opportunities to help.
One thing that could be helpful in this time is for Amazon to regularly brief the public on the health of its distribution networks and its expectations for any service interruptions in the immediate future. The company has historically worked to keep the media at greater than arms length, communicating primarily by press release. 
But the current crisis is changing the companys service so frequently, and with such high stakes, that a different approach is needed. One model Amazon might consider is that of Facebook, which over the past couple years began hosting regular briefings on subjects in the news. (There have been a lot about Russia, misinformation, and election security, for example.) Last week, the company held a briefing on its coronavirus response, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg took questions from the press.
If it undertook similar measures, Amazon could build confidence in its services. The alternative a torturous drip of news about service disruptions, delivered at odds hours across various news outlets who manage to get a response back from the companys public relations team has made for a grim status quo. It is not an approach that bears the hallmarks of customer obsession.
If you pay for Amazon Web Services, the company sells you guaranteed uptime if the service fails more than 0.01 percent of the time, you get a discount on future service. Already, some are speculating that Amazon will offer similar discounts to those affected by the understandable disruptions caused by COVID-19.
But theres something else the company could do, and it has the virtue of being basically free. It could regularly tell all its customers whats happening today, and what to expect tomorrow. If Bezos is right that things are going to get worse before they get better, as he told his employees, then his customers could use as much time as possible to begin contemplating their alternatives.

Despite a series of decisive victories in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona, Joe Bidens presidential campaign is struggling to move forward. Campaigning online and staying relevant during the coronavirus pandemic are two major hurdles. Heres Marc Caputo at Politico:
Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also cant meet with donors at fundraisers which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy thats sinking into recession or perhaps worse.
Its a tough position, said Matt Littman, whos hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software.
Its harder to raise money when theres no face-to-face meeting and personal contact, Littman said. And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I cant count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.

Industry
Instagram has prototyped an unreleased ephemeral messaging feature that clears the chat thread whenever you leave it. It looks a lot like Snapchats most popular feature. Josh Constine at TechCrunch has the scoop:
Instagram Stories caused Snapchat to start shrinking at one point, but now its growing healthily again. That may signaled that Instagram still had more work to do to steal Snaps thunder. But Instagrams existing version of ephemeral messaging that is clunkier, Facebook scrapped a trial of a similar feature, and WhatsApps take that started testing in October hasnt rolled out yet.
Thats left teens to stick with Snapchat for fast-paced communication they dont have to worry about coming back to haunt them. If Instagram successfully copies this feature too, it could reduce the need for people to stay on Snapchat while making Instagram Direct more appealing to a critical audience. Every reply and subsequent alert draws users deeper into Facebooks web.

Photo by John Nacion/NurPhoto via Getty Images
In a normal year, fourth-year medical students across the United States would have some downtime in April. They would have already found out where theyll be doing their residencies and should have the whole month or more to coast through to graduation and the start of their medical careers in the summer. 
But this isnt a normal year, and a handful of medical schools around the country are offering to let students graduate early so they can join the fight against COVID-19. The Grossman School of Medicine at New York University was the first to do so. Eligible students whod already met graduation requirements could become doctors a few months ahead of schedule if they agreed to join the emergency or internal medicine departments at NYUs hospital. 
Gaby Mayer is one of the dozens of NYU students who volunteered to graduate early. (Full disclosure: shes also my friend.) Shed first heard that early graduation might be an option a few weeks ago when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo mentioned the possibility at a press conference. We werent sure if it would really get there, but we knew that other countries that were getting hit hard by COVID-19 were entertaining similar plans, she says. 
Now that its official, she says shes relieved that she can help. 
This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
How did you feel when you were officially asked to graduate early?
Wed all been talking about it informally as medical students. We really felt like a lot of us were sitting around doing a lot of nothing between now and graduation. We were feeling really happy to have a skill set where we could go into the hospital and relieve some of the strain. The first response was relief and, in some ways, excitement.
I think Id be remiss to not say I was a little nervous. The prospect of becoming a doctor for the first time is always going to be overwhelming, and theres a big learning curve at the beginning. To be learning in this hectic environment is certainly an additional challenge, but I think were ready for it. 
What are you doing to prepare for COVID-19, specifically? 
Ive been keeping up with case reports and keeping an eye on the medical literature. Now, Ill dive in a bit more. Since the announcement, a lot of us have put together a plan for the next few weeks less about COVID-19, but more about how well be transitioning our role in the hospital. 
What will your role be in the hospital during the outbreak?
Im not sure how much of what Ill be doing will be different from what I would have been doing in my first year. But normally, wed be there to keep parts of patient care moving forward so they receive appropriate care. Were the first ones to see patients in the morning, we coordinate consults between the different areas of medicine, write notes on patients, and keep the closest eye on them. We do that so the senior medical staff, whos closely supervising us, can both teach us about things like diagnoses but also so they can have room to think about the higher-level plan. 
The dean mentioned that we wouldnt be seeing intubated or medically complex patients, so my guess is that theyll try to keep us out of COVID-19 areas. But its hard to say for sure. 
How does it feel to enter medicine and become a doctor right now?
I feel really prepared. I wouldnt have volunteered if I felt in any way that I wouldnt be able to serve my patients. I think Im going to have to adjust my expectations, but there wont be a lot of adjusting of the core things I need to be a good doctor. 
I think I am a little nervous, of course. A big part of [the first year of residency] is about having a strong team to walk you through this new identity and new role. I think Im a little bit nervous about whether well get the same attention. Well get the same supervision in terms of patient care, but this is all happening in a crazy environment. 
But the biggest feeling I have is one of gratitude that I can help. Im really committed to patient care. Its the reason I went to medical school, and it keeps me really grounded. To be able to come back to that is a gift in a time when things are so crazy.

Those sequences help scientists map the relationships between COVID-19 patients.,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199782/coronavirus-samples-genetic-analysis-covid-spread-biotech-pandemic,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilFw-yds1KyTnD1ZaqdjqjFJl-s=/0x286:4000x2380/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19859174/1199129371.jpg.jpg,2020-03-31T13:25:59Z,"Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images As the coronavirus spreads around the globe, it has mutated in tiny, subtle ways. Those mutations aren’t cause for concern, and so far, don’t appear to be making the virus any more or less dangerous. But scientists can use those slight changes to track the virus from person to person, and location to location. “If we identify a new outbreak cluster in one state, and there’s a question of whether it’s related to a previous cluster or not, the small mutational changes can help you figure out if they’re connected,” says Patrick Boyle, a synthetic biologist at Ginkgo Bioworks. The coronavirus is made up of around 29,000 building blocks of genetic material called nucleotides. Like other biotechnology companies and labs, Ginkgo has the technology to take a sample of the virus and read out the full sequence of those nucleotides. For the most part, the sequence will be the same in each sample. But the virus makes copies of itself within a human host, and sometimes, it can make mistakes — switching one or two nucleotides out for another. The version of the virus with those changes can then be passed on when that person infects someone else. Ginkgo is repurposing its systems, which normally don’t sequence viruses, to analyze as many samples of the coronavirus as possible. The goal is to help build out the maps that show how the virus jumped from one person to the next. They’re hoping to scale up to be able to publish the full genetic sequence of 10,000 virus samples a day. This is awesome. I know groups that currently have samples in need of sequencing. I'll let them know about @Ginkgo 's offer. — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 24, 2020 Despite the skyrocketing numbers of COVID-19 cases in the US, only a limited number of virus samples collected in the country have been sequenced in full. Scientists have more sequences from Washington state than other places. Consequently, they know more about the trajectory of the outbreak in Washington than they know about outbreaks in other states. Some of that genetic data is how Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was able to link a case of COVID-19 diagnosed on February 27 in Washington to a case that was diagnosed in late January in the state — indicating that the virus had been circulating locally, and undetected, for that entire time. It also showed that the January case sparked a cluster of illnesses that spread through the community. Other states are starting to do the same kind of detective work, using genetic sequences to help clarify their outbreaks. An analysis of nine virus samples collected in Connecticut showed that the some were related to viruses found in Washington state, which suggests that the coronavirus was spreading domestically, not being repeatedly brought in from other countries. The analysis has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. Other preliminary research examined virus samples from northern California, and found that the coronavirus was introduced to the area at multiple points. New preprint from the @NathanGrubaugh lab. Here we sequenced 9 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from early cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut. The majority of the genomes clustered with other sequences from the U.S., suggesting spread across the country (thread) https://t.co/jCeyC48ExS pic.twitter.com/WIauOEUenU — Joseph Fauver (@JosephFauver) March 28, 2020 One challenge in expanding the number of virus sequences available, Boyle says, is obtaining patient samples to analyze. Labs in the US and other countries that are running tests for the virus receive hundreds or thousands of patient samples each day. But the focus of those labs is checking a sample to see if the coronavirus is there — and the patient has COVID-19 — or if it isn’t. The emphasis on testing and diagnosing patients is critical to track the pandemic, Boyle says. “The problem is, it only gives you a positive or negative answer,” he says. Tests don’t provide any extra information about the particular virus in each patient. Ginkgo plans to partner with testing labs, so that they can take a closer look at the virus in a patient sample after the testing is done. Other labs and groups worldwide are embarking on similar projects: a research consortium in the United Kingdom, for example, has over $20 million in funding to sequence samples. Boyle says that Gingko is coordinating with some other labs interested in this work. They’re also making sure that they can access the chemicals and other supplies they need to run the genetic analysis, Boyle says. “We want to make sure that our supply stream is not competing with the supply stream that keeps the testing running.” Expanding the number of coronavirus sequences available will give scientists a picture of the outbreak, in the US and around the world. Along with testing, it’s one way scientists can keep track of the virus’s movements — and help to rein it in."

This story is part of a group of stories called 
The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here.
Most days in this column I try to bring you one big story about the intersection of tech and democracy, but reading the news today I find I cant draw any real lessons for you. Instead I see a few clusters of stories that feel worth reading and thinking about. Lets take a look.
The big story of the week continues to be the (tentative, premature) plans to begin re-opening society as states manage to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections. Ive already linked Ed Yongs masterful piece in The Atlantic here once this week, but if youre new to the subject its where Id start. Its the frame around everything else youll read about what big tech companies are doing in response to the pandemic, from sophisticated contact tracing solutions to old-fashioned philanthropy. 
The most important thing to take away from that piece, as well as several others I have read this week, is that there is not a coordinated federal plan to manage the next phase of the crisis. Instead we have a president who says he wants to end lockdowns as soon as possible, despite lacking the authority to do so, and groups of governors on both coasts pledging to work together to manage the process on a regional basis. This seems likely to cause not a small degree of chaos, working against efforts to contain new outbreaks and undermining the well intentioned tech initiatives that are now percolating.
And we cant blame all of this on politics: even epidemiologists disagree on what the best path forward is. Heres Kai Kupferschmidt in Science:
What is the exit strategy? Weve managed to get to the life raft, says epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). But Im really unclear how we will get to the shore.
As they seek a path forward, governments around the world must triangulate the health of their citizens, the freedoms of their population, and economic constraints. Could schools be reopened? Restaurants? Bars? Can people go back to their offices? How to relax the lockdown is not something around which there is a scientific consensus, says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at HSPH. Most researchers agree that reopening society will be a long haul, marked by trial and error. Its going to have to be something that were going to have to take baby steps with, says Megan Coffee, an infectious disease researcher at New York University.
This uncertainty has huge implications for public health and the eventual recovery of the economy. And in the shorter term, it raises questions about how effective the Apple/Google collaboration on contact tracing will be, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman explores in The Verge today: 
The pandemic is moving at unprecedented speed, and public health experts are sprinting to build the tools they think might help bring it under control. Its a little bit of flying the plane while still building it, Dhillon says. Any automated contact tracing program would have to be carefully monitored to see how well it helps contain COVID-19, how people are interacting with it, and if its flagging more people than actually would be at risk from an exposure.
Whatever the systems eventually end up looking like, they have to be introduced alongside public health infrastructure to ensure they have as big an impact as possible. The tools cant be used in isolation, Liu says. You have to make sure you have the policies in place to support them. 
It seems likely that we will have those policies in place in California. But with President Trump framing the recovery as a partisan battle against Democratic governors, and people protesting stay-at-home orders already taking to the streets in Michigan, its hard to imagine an environment in which a coherent national response emerges.
A good question for tech giants right now is: what would you build in response to the pandemic if you knew there would never be a coordinated federal response? Are your interventions resilient to partisan warfare? Can they be?

A lesser concern: is Amazon getting stronger during the pandemic, or weaker?
On the stronger side, America is suddenly hugely dependent on the deliveries that Amazon provides. A huge number of local retail businesses may not survive the next several months, putting Amazon in an even stronger position to dominate e-commerce once the pandemic subsides. Jason Del Rey wrote about this possibility Friday at Recode: 
And then theres Amazon, which already accounted for nearly 40 percent of all US online retail sales thats around eight times more than its next competitor, Walmart. Before the pandemic, the US e-commerce industry only represented between 10 percent and 15 percent of overall retail. Now, that percentage seems likely to grow, setting up Amazon to have a bigger advantage over most other retailers, including Walmart.
With millions of Americans ordered to remain home, Amazon is now, more than ever, a lifeline for essentials for millions of people rather than just a convenient option for online shopping. Consumer spending on Amazon is up 35 percent from the same period last year, according to estimates from Facteus, a firm that analyzes more than 30 million daily payment card transactions to offer consumer spending insights to retailers and financial institutions. The labor numbers also reflect the companys growth; Amazon has hired 80,000 new workers in the past few weeks alone.
This seems to me to be a fairly airtight case that Amazon will come out of the pandemic stronger than before. At the same time, have you noticed how much of the company is in disarray? Each day brings a new story of COVID 19-related worker unrest, illness, or even death. Workers involved in organizing efforts have been fired in what they describe as retaliation. (Amazon denies they were fired for speaking out.) On Wednesday, France ordered the company to shutter its six warehouses in the country for several days to better assess the risk for contagion among its workforce there.
Its clear that these issues have had a significant effect on the quality of Amazons services during this time, as you may have noticed from the multi-week delays in receiving shipments of non-essential items and the nearly impossible task of ordering grocery delivery. (The company is currently adding new customers seeking grocery deliveries to a waitlist.)
I expect all those issues to get resolved in time, particularly as the company brings on board the tens of thousands of new workers it plans to hire. But I do wonder how the companys reputation for exploiting its workforce will haunt it as America re-opens. Theres already a significant swath of Americans who wont shop at Walmart over labor issues. I can imagine Amazon finding itself in a similar place among more wealthy and informed consumers assuming those consumers have any good alternatives to shop at.
* * * 
Finally: Zoom is an amazing tool for the moment. But while its equal to many tasks, its not ideal for almost any of them. 
Women in business meetings on Zoom find that it can be impossible to get a word in edgewise with the men.
People dating on Zoom find that etiquette makes it extremely difficult to know when to hang up.
Attendees of Zoom parties stare dead-eyed at the screen wondering if or when to speak.
I dont blame Zoom for not building software to address these and other shortcomings of video-chat based socializing. But it sure would be great if someone else did.

Verily, the Google sister company that launched a COVID-19 screening and testing program last month, told US lawmakers that its user data wont be used for commercial purposes or sold to third parties. But it also admitted its screening site is not in compliance with the HIPAA privacy rule. Heres Hugh Langley at Business Insider:
Verily has focused on the protection of the security and privacy of personal health information since the inception of its Baseline COVID-19 Program, the company wrote. With respect to its Baseline COVID-19 Program, Verily is not acting as a covered entity or a business associate as defined by HIPAA. As the Program expands, we will continue to prioritize the protection of individual health data. However, in the future if we engage in a program where we do become a covered entity or we are required to sign a BAA we will take all the appropriate steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA.

Governing
The Pentagons inspector general could not definitively determine whether the White House interfered with the procurement process for the JEDI contract because senior Defense Department officials were barred from answering verbal questions on the subject. Amazon sued the Defense Department last year, alleging that the Pentagon made several mistakes in its evaluation of bids. Heres Politicos Jacqueline Feldscher:
Trump repeatedly inserted himself into the JEDI review process in ways that presidents traditionally dont. In July, Trump said he would be asking the Pentagon to look at it very closely to see whats going on because he heard complaints about the review process from companies and lawmakers. Shortly after, the Pentagon put a contract award on hold so Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had recently taken the job, could review allegations that Amazon had been unfairly given an advantage for the contract.

The company offered an update on its fight against harmful misinformation today, announcing the launch of a couple of new features for promoting accurate news. One of these is a box that will appear for people who liked, reacted to, or commented on a post that Facebook later removed, encouraging them to visit the World Health Organization’s site. Facebook is separately launching a “Get the Facts” section full of vetted news about the pandemic. Today’s update follows a scathing report by nonprofit group Avaaz, which called the site an “epicenter of coronavirus misinformation” and cited numerous posts containing dangerous health advice and fake cures. The company pushed back on this accusation, saying it’s removed “hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation” in the past weeks. For milder content that doesn’t merit full removal, it cited statistics suggesting warning labels have a real effect: when people see the warning, they don’t click through to the original content 95 percent of the time. (We don’t know precisely how that compares to the normal clickthrough rate.) Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran told Politico that “Facebook should be proud of this step” to add new features, “but the step doesn’t reflect the full gamut of what we would like to see them do.” I want to share an update on the work we're doing to connect people with accurate information and limit the spread of... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, April 16, 2020 Facebook has warned users that they’ve engaged with misinformation before, opening a portal for people to check if they’d liked or followed Russian propaganda pages. The pop-up strategy is more proactive, though. And the message that Facebook shared seems subtler and less judgmental. If anything, it seems designed to avoid even telling people they fell for a fake story. Instead, it urges them to “help friends and family avoid false information about COVID-19” by sharing a link to the World Health Organization’s website."

""We urge everyone to follow the guidelines and protocols put forth by public health officials."" 
Goldenvoice added that the festival would be postponed until October 2020, and that any purchases for the original dates would be honored for the rescheduled weekend. Goldenvoice will notify purchasers by March 13 about refunds. 
The festival was to feature headliners like Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott, and Frank Ocean.

Goldenvoice did not state whether the more than 150 acts who were supposed to perform during the original April dates will also reschedule. 
Coachella's postponement follows a string of events canceled because of the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness known as COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control report 647 cases as of Tuesday, but other models suggest much higher numbers that aren't symptomatic yet. On March 6, South by Southwest canceled its Austin, Texas events. On Monday, Ireland canceled all Saint Patrick's Day parades.

""There's a calendar to launch more 5G cities over the next quarter, [but] we're not doing marketing launches right now just because of everything that's going on,"" she says. ""We're on track for the additional 30 this year, and we continue to expand coverage in the 30 that we launched last year. In Chicago, we have three times the nodes we did a year ago.""
Verizon's 5G launched almost exactly a year ago in Chicago and Minneapolis. In Chicago at the time, coverage was restricted only to a few sites in the city center. If Verizon's current coverage map is to be believed, it now covers the entire Loop, West Loop, and River North areas, as well as major avenues in much of the rest of the city.
AT&amp;T last announced a 5G expansion about a month ago, just as the COVID lockdowns were beginning, saying that it was expanding its low-band 5G from 80 to 100 markets. T-Mobile's president of technology Neville Ray said on April 1 that his carrier was rolling out mid-band 5G in Philadelphia, although he stopped short of calling it a launch.
Because of its very short range, Verizon's millimeter-wave 5G system is harder to set up (but faster) than the low-band and mid-band systems the other carriers have been most recently touting. Verizon will also get mid-band 5G using dynamic spectrum sharing, splitting existing frequency bands with 4G, ""probably during the third quarter of this year,"" Hemmer says.
New ""intelligent beamforming"" software will help with range from the millimeter-wave base stations, Hemmer says. In early March, I estimated those have about an 800-foot radius right now. Fortunately, Verizon won't need to do any more hardware swaps to increase its range, but it's waiting on that software, she says, without giving a time frame for it to show up.
COVID-19 lockdowns present a unique challenge for wireless carriers and ISPs. Their work is considered essentialthese are the networks the rest of us rely on for work and school. It turns out that in cities where Verizon's crews can stay outside, laying fiber and planting millimeter-wave 5G hardware on lampposts and light poles, they're actually finding it easier going because of clear streets. That's the rollout style we've seen in Chicago and Providence.
""When we're outside and we're attaching to city furniture, for the most part we're able to continue that work,"" Hemmer says. ""In some cases we have cities where the streets don't have traffic on them ... and a couple of cities have given us wider construction hours.""
But cities where the carrier needs access to building rooftops, such as I've seen in New York and Dallas, are more on hold to keep Verizon's staff safe. Access to buildings can also be a problem when landlords are locked down or absent. ""Right now we're choosing not to put our employees inside multi-dwelling units,"" Hemmer says.
That caution extends to testing and development labs as well. Hemmer says Verizon is doing as much ""remote testing"" as it can with its equipment providers to minimize the number of engineers it needs to send into the office. ""We do have labs we own, and they go in every day, but we send in the minimum amount of people, we do deep cleaning, and we don't have anyone flying in,"" she says.
The most recent data from our sibling company Ookla Speedtest shows that US internet networks are, by and large, holding up under the strain of the COVID-19 period. Fixed download speeds are down only 5 percent and mobile download speeds are down 3 percent over last month, Speedtest says on its blog.

 (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be following some of the central pages of President Donald Trump's playbook. And the results seem to be heading in an even more catastrophic direction. 
In the past seven days, the World Health Organization reports that Russia has added over 75,000 coronavirus cases, more than double the nearest European nation, the United Kingdom. Even more troubling: The growth rate of the disease was 56%. Moscow has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the country, with only scattered clusters in other major cities like St. Petersburg, and as far as some oil and gas fields in the more remote reaches of Siberia.
In Moscow, the mayor himself has conceded that numbers may be vastly under-counted. Last week, in an interview on Russia 24 television, Sergey Sobyanin said he believes the real Covid-19 count in his city was around 300,000, or more than triple the official government count of 92,676. A new Financial Times study even estimates that death toll may be higher than the official count by as much as 70%. And indeed, residents are largely taking to heart the government's warning to social distance and stay at home. 
""Sometimes I'll be walking around and it seems like it's the middle of the night and somebody just turned the lights on,"" David Grout, a translator, musician, and longtime American resident of Moscow said in a Zoom interview, describing how empty the usually crowded streets are these days. Use of masks is frequent, he said, adding that the city's center ""has its own sort of rules.""
Indeed, in St. Petersburg, Susan Katz, a longtime American citizen married to a Russian, told me that she estimates barely 10% of people on the streets wear masks. Starting on Tuesday, she said, masks will be required in St. Petersburg. There is officially a ban on people going to parks, but only some have yellow tape around them, and the weather has been idyllic as spring began arriving. She has seen few police on the streets enforcing any regulations. 
Which suggests the first page in Putin's playbook. The president is clearly stepping back from what rapidly seems to be turning into the greatest single challenge to his presidency, placing administration of the crisis in the hands of governors and mayors, most of whom owe their job to him in any event. 
Putin himself has largely disappeared from public view, confining his appearances to an occasional broadcast from a windowless room in his residence against a drab backdrop. In part, Putin's seclusion may be attributed to the fact that his minister of construction Vladimir Yakushev, culture minister Olga Lyubimova, and prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, all have come down with the coronavirus. 
On Saturday, Putin who loves vast displays of power and ceremony, told his people they were ""invincible."" These words were meant to have been spoken at a very different venue--the lavish May 9 celebration of Victory Day, the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II that was to have featured a parade through Red Square with Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping at his side. Canceled. Earlier, a nationwide referendum for a constitutional change that would effectively have bestowed on him presidency for life was postponed indefinitely. And, perhaps most troubling, his approval rating has plunged to 59% -- the lowest in 20 years, according to the independent Levada Center.
While officially, the government is doing all the right things to stem the vast economic impact of the coronavirus, these measures are not taking hold on large stretches of the population that are most seriously impacted. ""Putin not only doesn't control the situation, but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,"" Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British think tank Chatham House told The Guardian newspaper. ""He cannot adjust ... I think partly Putin's lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position."" 
The government has, nominally, taken the right measures. At the end of January, Russia closed its land borders with China, the entry of all foreign nationals was banned on March 18, and on March 30 it closed all borders with the outside world. On April 16, Putin introduced an economic stimulus plan to provide aid businesses in the form of interest free loans and employee payments, adding to an announcement from Mistushin a month earlier of a 300 billion rubles stimulus (about $4 billion). On April 1, the Prime Minister also revealed 1.4 trillion rubles (barely $19 billion) in total economic aid. The fact is that plunging oil prices and western sanctions have been wreaking havoc on the Russian economy even as Covid-19 began arriving.
But this help has not filtered down to many economic sectors, leading to potentially catastrophic results. Grout said local websites have reported cases of people being mugged on the street for groceries. Still, the shops are full and there are no real shortages. The question is how long people, out of work and sheltering, will be able to afford shopping.
""Russia has experienced a delayed beginning to the epidemic and is now seeing that increase in cases,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme told me. ""Russia has also increased its testing both in the urban areas and outside and the increased numbers may reflect partly that, but there's also been an increase in deaths which means the disease is clearly having an impact."" Then he added that Russia ""can learn some of the lessons that have been learned at great cost in Asia, in North America and in Western Europe."" 
The big question is whether Putin can learn and, more importantly, apply these lessons. He's already talked three times with Xi Jinping, leader of China where only the most draconian measures resulted in a dramatic turnaround in that nation's Covid-19 spread. Moreover, is Putin in any sense prepared to take such measures in a country where he clearly has little of Xi's ability simply to crack down on a people who may already be becoming restless. 
Last week, in a telephone call, Trump promised Putin to deliver a supply of ventilators, observing that Russia has had a ""hard time"" with the disease
On Monday, in a nationwide address, Putin took another page out of Trump's playbook and, though cases are continuing to mount nationwide at more than double the pace of any other nation in Europe, said that beginning on Tuesday, ""the national period of non-working days will be over for all sectors of the economy."" Still, he said regions or municipalities could keep the regulations in place if necessary. 
The fact is that both leaders could learn quite a lot from each other as the disease progresses through its various, pernicious stages. What is equally clear from both is that a hands-off approach or ducking reality and the accompanying hard choices can only lead to catastrophic results -- medically and politically."

The agreement comes after a protracted period of negotiation among the various constituencies -- including actors, directors and crews -- and relies on extensive testing, temperature checks, cleaning measures and physical distancing when possible. The parties also acknowledge that revisions might be necessary going forward.
Certain activities, such as writing and casting, are still encouraged to be conducted virtually whenever possible. At the same time, other parts of production -- including live studio audiences -- are being discouraged, and must be conducted with restrictions like social-distancing measures when used.
Actors and other performers, it's noted, are ""most vulnerable because they cannot wear PPE when cameras are rolling, and frequently will not be able to engage in physical distancing."" That will require greater testing frequency for them and those with whom they are in close contact.
There are some activities, such as makeup and fight scenes, where stronger safeguards aren't possible, the report acknowledges.
The plans have been submitted to officials in New York and California. But movie and TV production takes place all over the world, including Europe Canada and New Zealand, where work on the next ""Avatar"" movies is already scheduled to resume after a quarantine period.
The guidelines rely on the ability to respond appropriately if personnel contract the virus, and educating those on movie and TV sets, with a designated compliance officer. Efforts will also be made to ""assess health/wellness of all personnel prior to entry onto set.""
There are still plenty of questions regarding how all this will work practically, and significantly, how much it's going to cost. As Variety noted, the report's initial draft didn't specifically address how the expense of ""conducting extensive testing, cleaning and safety monitoring will be covered, and who will pay for it.""
The guidelines specify that personal protective equipment be worn, and provided ""to all cast and crew at no cost.""
The plan was produced by the Industry-Wide Labor Management Safety Committee Task Force, which was formed specifically for that purpose, with input from epidemiologists and sanitation experts."

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book ""Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos."" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable event on Monday: ""I'm taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah. Couple of weeks ago, I started taking it. Cause I think it's good, I've heard a lot of good stories.""
This admission about his use of hydroxychloroquine makes Trump's previous musings about using disinfectant to treat the coronavirus look sage. The President can call on the best scientists and doctors in the world for medical advice, and he comes up with this? Trump's own FDA in late April warned of the dangers of taking hydroxychloroquine outside of a hospital or a clinical study setting ""due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" 
Even Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto warned his viewers not to follow the President's example, saying, ""If you are in a risky population here, and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you."" (Trump swiftly slapped Cavuto down on Twitter.)
The President has made any number of other non-scientific claims about the coronavirus, including that warm weather will take care of the virus (don't count on it, says his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), or that the US had coronavirus ""totally under control,"" (see today's death toll of more than 91,000) or that we are ""very close to a vaccine"" (not likely, medical scientists say).
It's Trump's disregard for science that prompted the leading medical journal The Lancet to publish an unusual editorial over the weekend saying that ""Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics."" 
But he is not the only Trump to play fast and loose with the reality of this contagion: The apple falleth not far from the tree. A day before his father's stunning hydroxychloroquine admission, Eric Trump told Fox News that Democrats are milking the pandemic for political gain and trying to prevent his father from holding campaign rallies. And he predicted that after the presidential election on November 3 the ""coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen."" 
In fact, as the number of dead inches, day by day, toward 100,000, there is widespread agreement among scientists, including Trump's CDC Director, Robert Redfield, that a second wave of the pandemic will likely hit the US later this year. Redfield explained last month, ""There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through...We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time."" 
Not to be outdone, Donald Trump Jr. recently defended remarks he'd made on air before Fox News' large audience in February, when he suggested that ""for Democrats to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness."" He told Axios earlier this month that he was ""entitled to speak with such hyperbole."" 
Meanwhile, a week ago presidential son-in-law, senior adviser and savior of worlds Jared Kushner mused to a Time reporter that he couldn't ""commit one way or the other"" about the possibility of postponing the presidential election (neither he nor the President are legally empowered to do this). 
And at the end of April, Kushner touted to Fox News the ""great success"" of the Trump administration in fighting the coronavirus. Kushner told the network that he hopes the US will be ""really rocking again"" by July. The official death toll for Americans is already the worst in the world. A month and a half out, we're not rocking.
Jared's wife Ivanka, another senior adviser to the President, who is her father, also took one for the team by disregarding federal guidelines on not taking discretionary travel during the pandemic when she traveled from DC to her family golf club in New Jersey in mid-April.
First Lady Melania Trump? She has been strangely absent throughout this crisis despite her ""Be Best"" campaign that is focused on the well-being of American children -- and at a time when many children are living through what might be the most difficult experience of their lives.
Trump has cast the battle with coronavirus as a war and ordinary Americans as ""warriors."" But if the President is the general, he is leading his troops into battle armed with misinformation. Presumably, he is trying to control the narrative as he charges on toward the election -- and by doing so he appears more concerned with winning the election battle rather than beating the coronavirus. 
What an unbearable sadness for Americans to have such incompetence at the helm during the worst crisis in eight decades."

Chinese operatives helped amplify a viral text message that falsely claimed President Trump was going to instate a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, reports The New York Times. US officials said the operatives were engaging in disinformation tactics similar to the ones Russia used in 2016.
The rumor, which gained traction around mid-March, claimed to be coming from someone close to the White House. It said Trump was doing to lock down the country to stop the spread of COVID-19. Please be advised, one version of the text message began. Within 48 to 72 hours the President will evoke what is called the Stafford Act. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.
On March 15th, the White House National Security Council debunked the myth in a tweet, saying: Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.
Operatives created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it
While Chinese operatives did not create the message, intelligence agencies in the United States determined that they helped circulate it across different platforms, including on Facebook and over SMS. Those efforts enabled the messages to catch the attention of enough people that they then spread on their own, with little need for further work by foreign agents, the NYT reports.
In some cases, the agents created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it. Those people then sent it out to their networks, allowing the myth to gain traction.
The lockdown rumor isnt the first coronavirus myth that has been linked to China. Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, spread misinformation that the coronavirus may not have originated in Wuhan, and was instead brought by the US military. CDC was caught on the spot, he tweeted on March 12th. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied that they had anything to do with the viral text message, telling the NYT,The relevant statements are complete nonsense and not worth refuting."

Instacart will expand its COVID-19 sick pay to include more gig workers as part of an agreement with the attorney general for Washington, DC. Under the agreement, the company is also launching a telemedicine pilot in the DC area to remotely diagnose shoppers who believe they may have contracted the disease, and provide childcare assistance pay to eligible workers while schools are closed.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing
In March, Instacart announced that employees who were quarantined or tested positive for COVID-19 would receive 14 days of sick pay, meant to encourage them to stay home rather than spreading the disease further. But getting that pay has proven difficult for shoppers who have often been blocked from the benefit either by the unavailability of tests or confusion around which agencies are authorized to recommend quarantine.
In May, a Verge investigation found that Instacarts sick pay was difficult to access in practice, with little clear logic as to when claims were granted or denied. Out of eight shoppers who spoke to us, only three successfully received the benefit, often because of unique efforts on their part. 
Under the new policy, anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 by their health care provider would be eligible for sick pay even if they have not received a positive test. Instacart will also allow shoppers to actively seek a diagnosis through a new telemedicine system, administered through Doctor on Demand. Instacart also pledged to provide sick pay to shoppers who live in the same residence as someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, seeing them as particularly at risk of contracting the disease.
The new policy will still require documentation whether of a quarantine order or a positive diagnosis and the agreement does not contain any provisions for improving how the company processes those requests. Still, DC Attorney General Ken Racine said the new measures were vital to preventing further spread of the ongoing pandemic.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing, said Racine. During this pandemic, grocery delivery workers are risking their health to connect District residents to essential goods. Instacarts new policy will ensure that workers who are sick can stay home and seek care, and it helps protect their colleagues, consumers, and the public during this crisis. 
While the agreement was obtained through legal channels, theres been no allegation that Instacart acted illegally, and the agreement does not contain any admission of wrongdoing.
Instacart president Nilam Ganenthiran put the agreement in sunnier terms. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our team has been singularly focused on supporting the health and safety of our shopper community, he said in a statement. Were proud to partner with Attorney General Racine to expand our offerings and continue supporting our valued shopper community."

[extreme Stefon voice]: This story has everything: A high-speed super-yacht, a secret disaster strike force, a Google co-founder, and strawberry ice cream. 
The Daily Beasts Mark Harris has a wild story about Global Support and Development (GSD), a disaster charity founded by Sergey Brin thats being run by his former bodyguards. The story opens detailing how GSD provided disaster relief in the form of medical care and road-clearing crews after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas last year.
For the past five years, GSD has been quietly using high-tech systems to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance during high-profile disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These range from drones and super-yachts to a gigantic new airship that the outfit apparently hopes will make it easier to get aid supplies into disaster zones. 
And just as Google famously treatsor, pre-COVID-19 lockdown, treatedemployees to catered lunches, free gyms, and on-site massages, some of GSDs humanitarian workers have enjoyed strawberry ice cream and freshly laundered clothes on board Brins super-yacht during disaster deployments. 
The organization got its start in 2015 after Cyclone Pam pounded Vanuatu. Brins $80 million yacht, the Dragonfly, was sailing nearby with a doctor and paramedics on board, and the crew decided to spring into action. 
Making landfall at remote islands north of Vanuatus capital Port Vila, the Dragonflys team reportedly moved 62 metric tons of fresh water ashore, treated over 250 patients, facilitated three medical evacuations, and built shelters in multiple villages. 
The Daily Beast notes Brins philanthropy is similar to other attempted acts of benevolence from Silicon Valley billionaires (see: Musk, Elon and Gates, Bill) seeking to make a big impact. GSD even says its been involved with COVID-19 relief efforts, setting up drive-thru testing centers in California and provided supplies to eight US states. 
About half of the people working for GSD have military backgrounds. And not everyone is thrilled with the idea of a disaster rescue force made up of former military personnel, however well-meaning it may be: 
...[T]he use of ex-military personnel for humanitarian and conservation work is also controversial, according to Rosaleen Duffy, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Sheffield. They can arrive in complex situations with little understanding of the local context. They bring with them modes of thinking and acting, such as seeing certain groups of people as the enemy to battle against.
Whatever Brins motivation, this is a captivating story with great details about a billionaires mostly low-profile ventures into philanthropy, and his fascination with airships. Strongly recommend making time to check out the full story at The Daily Beast."

 But they still don’t have good tools to help people who aren’t severely ill In early March, most doctors in the United States had never seen a person sick with COVID-19. Four months later, nearly every emergency room and intensive care physician in the country is intimately familiar with the disease. In that time, they’ve learned a lot about how best to treat patients. But in some cases, they’re still taking the same approach they did in the spring. 
“There’s so much that’s different, and so much that’s the same,” says Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor at the Brown University Department of Emergency Medicine. 
“There’s so much that’s different, and so much that’s the same.”

For the first few months of the pandemic, recommendations for every incremental decision made in a hospital were changing faster than they ever have before. “You almost couldn’t keep up — from one day to the next, your practice would change and your protocols would change. It was really disorienting for doctors and nurses,” Ranney says. 
Information spread between colleagues, through medical education blogs and podcasts, and on social media. Doctors talked about new research on Twitter and shared new strategies in Facebook groups and on WhatsApp. If a suggestion that floated by a doctor in a Facebook group was low-risk and seemed like it might be helpful, it could be put into practice immediately. “If it’s a small change, they could start using it the next day,” she says. 
That’s how the now-common practice of asking patients with COVID-19 to flip onto their stomachs spread: through word-of-mouth and on social media. When someone is on their back, their organs squish their lungs and make it harder for their airways to fully expand. When someone is on their stomach, their lungs have more room to fill up with air. The advice started circulating through the medical community before there was a formal, published study on the practice. 
Testing it out wouldn’t have many downsides (it wasn’t dangerous to patients), and it was easy to do. “There’s this possibility that it could be positive, and there were a lot of stories about it having a positive effect,” Ranney says. “So, it spread in a much more organic and quick way, because it was something that we could do, but we weren’t worried it would hurt patients.”
Doctors like Seth Trueger, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University, saw the position help patients get enough oxygen to avoid needing a ventilator. “I started jokingly call it ‘tummy time,’” he says. Studies are starting to validate those observations, finding that patients who spent time on their stomachs were, in fact, better off.

Since March, physicians have also figured out other ways to help severely ill patients avoid ventilation. “We appreciate that it’s probably not a great thing for these patients, and we’ve developed other ways to get people high levels of oxygen,” says James Hudspeth, the COVID response inpatient floor lead at Boston Medical Center. For example, doctors are turning to nasal cannulas, which are noninvasive prongs that blow oxygen into the nose, before a ventilator. 
“We’ve developed other ways to get people high levels of oxygen.”

They have better medications for hospitalized patients now, too. Since March, doctors have cycled through a few different options — like hydroxychloroquine, which turned out not to be effective. Now, they’re primarily using remdesivir, and antiviral drug that appears to help COVID-19 patients recover more quickly, and the steroid dexamethasone, which helps improve the survival rate for patients on ventilators. “Many intensive care units and many hospitals have created their own standard order sets, or standard therapies, for people with COVID-19,” Ranney says. Those shift as new evidence comes out around different medications. 
That’s not unusual, Ranney says. Hospitals regularly change the drugs they use for conditions like flu and pneumonia as new data comes out. “What’s unusual is to change practice so quickly,” she says. “That’s just the reality of a global pandemic, with a disease we’ve never seen before.” 
Most of the changes in doctors’ strategies over the past few months have been in patients who are severely ill. If someone is sick enough to be hospitalized with COVID-19 but doesn’t need to be in intensive care, there still isn’t much doctors can do for them. They’ll get fluids to make sure they stay hydrated and are given oxygen if they need it. Doctors will try to keep their fever down and monitor them to see if they get sicker, but that’s about it. 
“It’s just those basic things,” Ranney says. Doctors now are more vigilant to the threat from blood clots, which have appeared in many COVID-19 patients over the past months. Because testing is more available in hospitals than it was earlier this year, they’ll also confirm that a moderately ill patient actually does have COVID-19 — and avoid giving them unnecessary treatments. But active interventions for patients with less severe symptoms are still around the same as they were back in March. “We’re still kind of in this watchful waiting,” she says.
Active interventions for patients with less severe symptoms are still around the same as they were back in March

One lingering question, Hudspeth says, is figuring out how to keep those moderately ill patients from becoming severely ill. Steroids may be helpful earlier on, he says, as could artificial antibody treatments that block the virus, though those strategies are still under investigation. “Part the challenge we face at the present moment is that the moderate patients are often where we would want to intervene,” he says. 
Changes to treatment strategies for patients who are not severely sick have been harder to come by — in part because it’s riskier to try something new in that group. If someone isn’t dangerously sick, there isn’t as much to gain from using an experimental treatment that may have a chance of causing harm, so doctors are less likely to take risks. “We’re more likely to try stuff with sicker patients,” Ranney says. “And their families are more likely to consent to a clinical trial.” 
Despite the open issues around COVID-19 treatments, the rate of new information is slowing down. Doctors aren’t shifting their practices as quickly as they were back in March and April, and Trueger says he thinks the next few months may be relatively stable. Doctors might get new information about which medications are more or less helpful, but other common best practices might be more entrenched. “I don’t think things are going to as rapid as the changes we had up front, when we were really flying half blind,” he says."

When humans cut their way through forests to dig up gold and other minerals that go into phones, computers, and other devices, they run the risk of being a catalyst for a phenomenon called spillover. Thats what happens when a virus makes the leap from one species to another. Its how two-thirds of new infectious diseases, like COVID-19, emerge. 
The novel coronavirus that has infected more than 10 million people, killing more than 500,000 worldwide to date, began as an animal virus. The virus got the opportunity to jump from one species to another, and it eventually landed in a human. Researchers first thought that the virus made the leap from animals in a marketplace in Wuhan, China. But there are plenty of other situations humans create that make it easier for novel viruses to reach us, including mining. The Verge dug into a smartphone and connected the dots between the minerals inside and the potential for another new virus to wreak havoc across the globe. 
We implicate ourselves in this chain of consumer supply and demand.
Our choices as consumers ... cause miners to go in there and come in contact with wild animals that carry viruses. We implicate ourselves in this chain of consumer supply and demand, says David Quammen, author of the book Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic. That is one of the broader causes of contact with wild animals that leads to spillover of new viruses with the potential of becoming epidemic and pandemic, says Quammen.
Take gold, for example, which is used in a lot of electronics because it conducts electricity pretty well. Marburg, a viral hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola, killed 128 people in Congo between 1998 and 2000. Scientists surmised that gold miners probably picked up the virus from animals, like bats, in mines, and the virus spread from there. Thats just one of several instances of spillover related to mining that The Verge came across as we were researching this video.
Its not just gold thats a concern, either. Like gold, a metallic ore called coltan (short for columbite-tantalite) is highly sought-after by electronics manufacturers. Its used to make tantalum capacitors that control the flow of electricity through a circuit board. Because both gold and coltan are valuable in small quantities, theyre also attractive to subsistence miners. Subsistence mining, also called artisanal or small-scale mining, is done informally often with little more than shovels, picks, and pans. 
A majority of coltan is mined at this small scale in Congo. And compared to big, industrial operations, small-scale mining comes with a lot more chances for viruses to spill over from animals to humans, experts say. For instance, subsistence miners working in remote areas might not have access to food markets, so theyre more likely to hunt for food that could make them sick. Our latest video explores the different ways a miner might contract a new virus and unintentionally trigger an outbreak.

Ultimately, the way humans interact with animals and the environment can have grave consequences for our own well-being. Thats why scientists and public health experts have developed a strategy for addressing the ways in which the health of the environment and all of the people and wildlife living in it are connected. Its an approach called one health. It brings together experts from different disciplines from conservation biology to medicine to keep people and the planet healthy. The idea has been around for decades, but the approach gained a lot of traction after outbreaks of another coronavirus, SARS-CoV (which was thought to have originated in bats), in 2003. 
Its one world, one health, because we all live in the same place, says Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio, an associate vice president for conservation and health at the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance. We are part of the animal kingdom. So we need to understand that thats the reason we share all these viruses with animals, he says.
We are part of the animal kingdom. So we need to understand that thats the reason we share all these viruses with animals.
There are ways to lessen the risk of virus spillover from mining and other extractive industries, according to Zambrana-Torrelio. It mostly entails having a more controlled environment when mining: performing environmental impact assessments, ensuring that there is safe food for miners to eat, and that there are rules against hunting for bushmeat while on the job. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has also developed recommendations for minimizing the risk of new diseases emerging in mining camps, which includes monitoring workers health and keeping an inventory of the local wildlife. But all of that is hard to do when it comes to informal, often illegal, subsistence mining.
EcoHealth Alliance, working in partnership with USAID since 2009, has found 1,200 new viruses including more than 140 coronaviruses. It only takes one of those to throw the world into another pandemic. Anywhere we destroy habitats by doing things like mining for minerals, were not just harming the environment were potentially setting ourselves up for another global crisis."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every facet of our lives, so it’s only natural that it would impact more than one of Apple’s product announcements at yesterday’s WWDC. Whether it’s the Apple Watch’s handwashing feature or the new face mask options for Memoji, the pandemic’s presence was repeatedly felt during Apple’s presentation. And let’s not forget, its entire prerecorded streaming format was driven by the pandemic in the first place.
In some cases, Apple’s announcements seemed to come in direct response to the pandemic, but others, like bicycle directions for Maps, were almost certainly in development prior to COVID-19. They just happen to be releasing at a time they’re needed most.
Apple has already made at least one change in response to the pandemic. Last month, with iOS 13.5, the company made it easier to unlock your Face ID-equipped phone if you’re wearing a mask. This is also the same iOS update that included support for Apple’s and Google’s contact-tracing API. 
Here are the biggest ways the COVID-19 pandemic was on display at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference:

 watchOS 7 can sense when you’re washing your hands and remind you to keep washing if you stop early.

 
The Apple Watch’s handwashing feature (obviously)
Let’s start with the obvious one: the Apple Watch is being updated to encourage you to wash your hands properly. We’ve seen similar features added to Samsung and Wear OS smartwatches, but Apple is claiming that its Watch is the first to automatically detect when you’re washing your hands. 
It does this by analyzing your hand motion using machine learning and listening to confirm the sound of running water. Then, it’ll display a countdown timer and alert you when you’ve washed your hands for the recommended amount of time. If you try to stop early, it’ll prompt you to carry on.

 Face coverings are just one of the new Memoji options.

 
Memoji face coverings
As COVID-19 spread around the world, face masks quickly emerged as a simple yet effective way of reducing transmission. Now, as countries are reckoning with how to allow businesses to open up post COVID-19, many are requiring people to wear face masks. They’re now required on many domestic flights in the US as well as in some theater chains. 
So it makes sense that Apple would add them as a Memoji customization option. During its WWDC presentation, the company showed off a Memoji wearing a green medical face mask, a color you can customize, according to the release notes for iOS 14.

 Cycling directions in Apple Maps give you information about how busy a route is.

 
Apple Maps cycling directions
Cycling directions aren’t something you build at the last minute, but they’ve been missing from Apple Maps for so long (Google Maps added them in 2010) that it’s still a wonderful coincidence they’d launch during the pandemic, just as interest in cycling is booming. Social distancing rules are difficult to maintain on public transport, so cycling is being promoted by cities as a healthier, more environmentally friendly alternative for getting around. The amount of time Apple spent on the feature during its presentation shows how important cycling has suddenly become.
With iOS 14, Apple Maps is getting updated with cycling directions for New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai, and Beijing. You’ll see elevation changes along your route, and the app can suggest times when you might be better off walking your bike up and down some stairs rather than cycling the long way round. A screenshot of the functionality shown by Apple shows that the app can give you a choice between faster and less busy routes.

 App Clips were advertised as a quicker way to rent shared e-scooters, among other things.

 
App Clips for micromobility sharing and more
Micromobility sharing services are another way to avoid public transport, and with iOS 14, Apple has introduced a feature that should make it easier to rent shared vehicles like e-scooters regardless of what brand you stumble upon. App Clips are a means of getting a small portion of an app onto your phone in seconds without having to go through the normal process of downloading it from the App Store. At WWDC, Apple specifically demoed it being used to unlock and rent an e-scooter.
App Clips are a big feature that Apple envisions being used for everything from paying for parking to ordering coffee in a shop without having to interact closely with other humans. It looks like a feature that Apple was going to introduce regardless of the pandemic, especially after Google’s Instant Apps for Android launched in 2017. But as companies like Starbucks turn to mobile ordering systems to help with social distancing and contactless payments, App Clips could help with many more aspects of our post-coronavirus lives.

 Messages is getting updated with better support for groups.

 
Messages and FaceTime improvements
It’s no secret that the pandemic has made messaging and video communications apps more important than ever, and we’ve already seen multiple companies introduce new features in response. WhatsApp and Google Duo have increased the maximum number of participants you can have in a call, Google has made its Meet videoconferencing service free for anyone with a Google account, and Zoom has become a household name. 
In a similar vein, Apple’s services are receiving a series of updates that should make them more effective communication tools, which will be especially helpful during the pandemic. Messages, for example, is getting better support for group chats in iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur. You’ll be able to respond to specific messages in a chat and call people out by name — two features that are critical for facilitating communications with large groups. iOS 14’s new picture-in-picture options will also make it easier to multitask while on FaceTime calls. While on a call, if you swipe up to go to your home screen, the call will minimize to a small picture-in-picture mode and continue playing, even when you open another app.

 Tim Cook took to the stage in an empty auditorium to begin yesterday’s presentation.

 
The presentation as a whole
Of course, the online-only format of the presentation was probably the single biggest way the pandemic was on display at WWDC. Rather than opting for an onstage demonstration in the style that the company has been using for decades, COVID-19 forced Apple to reinvent its approach, with individual presenters describing and demonstrating its software across various locations.
At the end of the presentation, Apple took a moment to detail its commitment to health and safety during filming. Face coverings were worn by everyone on set aside from the on-camera presenter, social distancing measures were observed, and Apple says that when multiple presenters were featured, they were isolated from one another.
It was a refreshing change for a company that’s used the same approach for its demonstrations for years, dating back to the time of its late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. To me, it felt like a change for the better. The whole presentation was slick and densely packed with information, even if a little atmosphere may have been lost due to the lack of a live audience. 
It was a refreshing change of pace, and I’d like to see at least parts of this style stick around even when it’s safe for Apple to do public presentations again."

 Just when you thought dating during quarantine couldn’t get any worse The texts came nearly every morning. I love you. I miss you. I adore you. If Grace* didn’t answer immediately, Scott, her boyfriend — or beloved, as he liked to call himself — would get worried. Was she okay? Why wasn’t she answering her phone?
It had only been a few months, but Grace knew she and Scott were going to spend the rest of their lives together. They’d met on OurTime, a dating site for people over the age of 50. She was retired, middle class, a widow with three kids who all now had families of their own. He was a successful businessman who worked in solar energy, drove a Mercedes, and had two houses — one in Cuba and another in the US. He was wealthy and promised he would take care of her. There was just one catch: he was stuck in Havana because of COVID-19 and couldn’t access his money. Could she help? 
Of course she could. Grace was in love. She trusted him. And wasn’t she ultimately using his money? So yes, she wrote some very large checks to pay for Scott’s business ventures, through a checking account he’d opened in her name. But the money in those accounts was money Scott had wired in; she was just helping him access it. 
“I followed like a freakin’ sheep”

Then Grace started getting calls from the bank. The wires were being reversed; they were fraudulent. Grace was on the hook for more than $100,000. By the time she caught on to what was happening, Scott had disappeared, as had all of his online profiles.
“I followed like a freakin’ sheep,” Grace tells me. “I just can’t convey how humiliated and embarrassed I am. I’m just distraught that I got myself into this.”
But how could she not? The vision that Scott laid out in lengthy emails and text messages was one of comfort and closeness. “I can’t stop thinking about you and the future we have promised each other,” he wrote on February 13th. “lt has been the most amazing few weeks of my life, getting to know someone as loving and caring as you. l am opening up to you more and more. l love how it is happening naturally. l think about you a lot and just want you to know that. i can’t hold back the feelings growing inside me everyday for you. l hope you know that and feel it constantly too. My heart belongs to you now always and forever.”
Later, he began laying the groundwork for the financial fraud, which involved a joint business venture in Cuba. He framed it as an act of generosity — as the wealthier person in the relationship, he was sharing his resources with her. “All the money that l will ever make from now on l plan to put it into our common account together and plan the future and everything else we do with that,” he wrote. “l am completely open about my financial background with you in every way. l am trusting you with everything l am as a man now and forever.”
Grace had fallen victim to a romance scam, a complex web of fake personas, fraudulent wire transfers, and fictitious business opportunities. While these types of rackets aren’t new, they’ve grown more sophisticated with the advent of online dating and social media. Fraudsters like “Scott” use a network of online accounts — LinkedIn, dating sites, a bank, even Zillow — to make themselves look trustworthy and successful. Then they sweep the victim off their feet, quietly get access to their finances, and vanish. By the time the victim realizes what’s going on, it’s nearly impossible to find the scammer. 
The problem has been exacerbated by COVID-19, which has provided the perfect cover for romance scammers. Prior to the pandemic, it might have seemed odd to start a relationship with someone without ever meeting in person. Now, for many older people who are single and also more susceptible to the virus, online romance is the only option. 
The result is that people like Grace, who are savvy, well educated, and technically competent, are falling prey. Over the course of months, they’re seduced by the sincerity and openness of their suitor. The oddities that might otherwise have tipped them off — like the person being stuck in another country — appear ordinary and reasonable during quarantine.
“These scams are crimes, but for some reason the victim gets blamed”

To Grace, the damage is emotional as well as financial. “I don’t have anyone to talk to; I don’t want to tell my family I’m an idiot,” she says. It’s a level of shame that is typical for romance scams victims, says Amy Nofziger, director of the Fraud Watch Network at the AARP. “These scams are crimes, but for some reason the victim gets blamed a lot,” she says. “It can happen to anyone. These people are smart, they’re educated. They just fell in love.”
Grace moved to Northern Illinois a year ago to be closer to her two sisters and her son. She’d been with her husband for nearly 20 years before he died from cancer in 2017. She wasn’t lonely, but she also wasn’t ready to give up on the idea of finding love. So she signed up for OurTime. In January 2020, she met a handsome businessman who said his name was Scott F. Parker. 
“He was very smooth, very persuasive, and very attentive,” Grace says. They started out talking on the app, then moved to texting and talking on the phone. Communication was nearly constant, and before long, they were in a committed relationship. “I was just surprised because all these great things were happening and we had never even met,” she says. “We were going to live this great life and travel. He had all this money and was going to take care of me. Every text started out ‘I love you and adore you so much.’”
Scott was open about nearly every detail of his biography. He told Grace his birthday (October 16th, 1965), his home in Illinois (a stately four-bedroom in Oak Park), and his favorite cologne (Creed Aventus). He had her speak to his mother, Christina, on the phone so the two could get to know each other. He discussed what type of health care they should buy and described his new business in Havana: a 10-acre property that he was turning into a resort. He said it would be part of their retirement. 
Her children, when she told them, were skeptical. They pointed out that she’d never actually met Scott in person. But Grace had no reason to worry. Scott was the one with money, and he spoke of little else but when he’d be able to come see her. 
Then, in April, he started pitching Grace on the idea of going into business together. The resort in Havana could be their resort in Havana, he said. The lockdowns were extending so he couldn’t come home, but he’d send the paperwork so she could get things started in his absence.
Scott set Grace up with an LLC, which he registered on incfile.com. Then he opened three checking accounts. He explained that he’d be wiring in money, and the bank wouldn’t insure anything over $250,000. When Grace logged into one account, she saw a wire transfer for $339,000. He asked her to pay some vendors he was working with. So she started writing checks. 
It’s more work than most people put into a real relationship

For two months, everything seemed fine. If Grace had been skeptical at first, the amount of time that passed put her at ease. Then in June, the wires started getting reversed. The bank said they were fraudulent. “It totally blindsided me,” Grace says. She had to come up with the money for the checks she’d already written, which totaled more than $100,000. “That’s the part that scares the crap out of me,” she says. She’s still waiting to hear from the banks on whether they will come to collect. She doesn’t know what she’ll do if they do — she can’t afford to lose that kind of money.
It isn’t unusual for romance scammers like Scott to spend months gaining their victims’ trust. It’s what makes these crimes so difficult to execute but so lucrative when they’re successful. “When you think you’re in love with someone, it’s one of the most powerful emotions out of there,” says John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications, and fraud at the National Consumers League. “We pretty consistently see people losing their life savings and maxing out credit cards.”
Since 2015, financial losses associated with romance scams have increased sixfold. In 2019, they became the costliest scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission, with a record $201 million lost. And while anyone can fall victim, Nofziger says scammers tend to target older people, who hold the majority of wealth in the United States. 
Oftentimes, scammers operate in groups, with one person playing the man or woman falling in love and others acting as business associates or family members. After meeting the victim on a dating site, Nextdoor, or even Words With Friends, they’ll quickly try to move off the platform where the conversation can’t get easily flagged. Grace isn’t sure how Scott’s scheme worked, but she suspects that the money she sent to vendors was actually going to him. His mother “Christina” was a character designed to make Grace feel at ease.
One difficulty with fraud carried out on a network of online platforms is that it’s hard to catch the scammer without cross-company collaboration. Dating sites, social media platforms, and banks are all used in the scheme, but without a method to track the person across websites, it’s nearly impossible to find out their real identities. “Nobody seems to take responsibility,” says Breyault. “There’s no way to stop the transaction.”
Even with that collaboration, it can still be difficult for the victim to understand they’ve been tricked. Scammers like Scott spend months gaining their mark’s trust and showering them with love and affection. It’s more work than most people put into a real relationship, which might be the first sign that the romance is too good to be true. Scott might not have loved Grace, but he certainly loved the thrill of the chase. 
For Grace, the facade started to crumble when Scott failed to wire the money to cover the transactions that had been reversed. He stayed committed to the scam, telling her the funds were coming; the banks were just being difficult. But she knew in her heart it was a lie. She sent him an email calling him out on being a scammer and saying he was a despicable human. “My life was just fine before I met you. I certainly had more self esteem before meeting you,” she wrote. “I trusted you and believed what you’ve told me, the promises you made and that we could have this wonderful fantasy life. Congratulations on pulling a dirty scam and doing everything you did to make me suffer when I’ve never done anything to harm you.”
“How can you say those things about me?” he responded. He said he was about to fly home. She never heard from him again.
Grace had been alone before she met him, but now she was left more isolated, without anyone to talk to about what she’d been through. It’s one thing to be abandoned by someone who said they loved you. It’s another to be ghosted by someone who never existed in the first place.

Qualcomm expects smartphone shipments to fall 30 percent in the comings months due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company said today, cutting its previous projections for the next quarter.
Thats in addition to the 21 percent reduction in demand for phones that the company noted in the past quarter, which it reported in an earnings release this afternoon. Qualcomm did still manage to beat its Q2 revenue expectations despite that drop in demand, with Q2 revenue of $5.2 billion (compared to the projected $5.02 billion), but net income was down dramatically, dropping 29 percent year-over-year to $468 million. 
Qualcomm says there are three coronavirus-related factors that could impact sales in the coming months:
<ul><li>How the COVID-19 virus, and government policies around the world to prevent its spread, will impact business and consumer confidence</li><li>Demand for new smartphones sold by customers or licensees that use Qualcomm products</li><li>The state of the global wireless supply chain, distribution networks, and workforces </li></ul>The company also also cites other, non-coronavirus-related factors that may impact its revenue in the company quarter, including its licensing dispute with Huawei, network rollouts, and its dependance on a small number of customers and licensees and the premium-tier device segment of the market. 
Despite the expected drop in demand for new devices, Qualcomm is still sticking to its original estimate for 5G devices shipped in 2020, with the company expecting to see 175 million and 225 million 5G phone shipments this year. The nascent 5G market is a big part of Qualcomms business, with the companys modems serving as some of the only viable options for device manufacturers to support the next-generation network to the point where Apple was forced to settle its ongoing disputes with the company in order to get access to those modems for its upcoming 5G iPhones."

General Motors is delaying the upcoming reveal of the new all-electric Hummer truck, which was originally scheduled for May 20th because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker isnt yet offering a replacement date for the launch of the new electric vehicle, but it says that the production schedule isnt currently affected. The new Hummer is due out in late 2021. 
GM announced back in January that it was resurrecting the Hummer as a 1,000-horsepower electric truck under its GMC brand, and it teased it in a Super Bowl ad starring LeBron James. The vehicle line, which became synonymous with the excess of enormous gas-guzzling SUVs, was retired in 2010 as the automakers recovered from the financial crisis. The new EV version will be built at GMs Detroit-Hamtramck factory, which the automaker is retrofitting to make electric and autonomous vehicles. 
The new Hummer EV is just one of a slew of electric vehicles that GM is working on as part of a more than $20 billion push into the space. The company detailed that plan at its first EV Day in March. 
Automakers around the world have delayed events and product launches, shut down factories, and even pivoted to making ventilators and other critical equipment as the novel coronavirus turned into a pandemic. The worlds biggest auto shows have also been canceled or postponed.

Nuro, the autonomous vehicle startup founded by two ex-Google engineers, is using its small fleet of road-legal delivery robots to transport medical supplies around two California stadiums that have been converted into treatment facilities for people stricken with COVID-19. 
The coronavirus pandemic has forced self-driving car companies in California to temporarily shutdown their operations and ground their fleets, thanks to shelter-in-place orders that ban nonessential transportation. But Nuro realized it could still play a role in delivering goods for health care workers by using its R2 prototype vehicles. These lightweight electric vehicles are built from the ground up to be completely driverless and, with slight alterations, could also provide contactless delivery, said Dave Ferguson, CEO of Nuro. 
Robots are not solving this crisis
Robots are not solving this crisis, Ferguson said in an interview with The Verge. But by providing truly contactless delivery of goods Nuro can help provide essential supplies to frontline health care workers who are fighting the virus. Thats actually very beneficial for both parties [by] drastically reducing all possibility of contagion, he said. 
Nuros robots are ferrying food, personal protective equipment (PPE), clean linens, and other supplies to workers at two facilities in California: the Event Center in San Mateo and the Sleep Train Arena, which is typically home to the Sacramento Kings. Both facilities have been converted into field hospitals to handle the overflow of patients who have contracted COVID-19. 
Human workers load and unload the vehicles at either end of the route. Typically, Nuros vehicles require the delivery recipient to input a code on a touchscreen to make the doors open. But to make it truly contactless, workers are only required to give a thumbs-up to the vehicles camera and a Nuro operator monitoring the live feed will open the doors remotely. 
One of Nuros vehicles will be operating inside the Sleep Train Arena, making deliveries to workers at either end of the facility. The transport that were doing reduces the amount of transport that otherwise would need to be done by the healthcare staff, Ferguson said. This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area.
This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area
The vehicles at both locations are on fixed, preplanned routes on private roads, which minimizes the chance theyll encounter anything too complicated. While they are capable of traveling up to 25 mph, the R2 vehicles will be limited to 5 mph outdoors and 2.5 mph indoors. 
This represents a significant shift to Nuros typical operations, which are focused on grocery and food delivery in Arizona and Texas. In addition to a small number of R2 vehicles, the company also conducts deliveries using its fleet of retrofitted Toyota Priuses with two safety drivers in each. But due to social distancing rules, the company is only using one safety driver per vehicle for its delivery routes in Arizona and Texas, and is mostly operating its vehicle manually. Testing in California has been temporarily halted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place rules.
The company also has the distinction of being the first autonomous vehicle operator to receive a federal exemption to mass-produce driverless vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or sideview mirrors. Nuro also was recently approved to test its driverless delivery robots on public roads in California becoming only the second company to receive such a permit.
The pandemic has made it an extremely precarious time for self-driving car companies, especially those that have been unable to secure enough funding to sustain their operations through an extended shutdown. But Ferguson said that Nuro has so far been able to avoid layoffs and furloughs by developing tools that allow its operations team to contribute remotely from their homes, as well as investing in simulation that allows it to continue running its vehicle tests in a virtual world. (The companys nearly $1 billion from SoftBank probably didnt hurt to have either.)
Were feeling pretty good about this this being within our control, Ferguson said, and its sort of up to us to execute and make it happen."

 Amazon tech workers are calling out sick today in protest of the company’s treatment of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The action, which will consist of a live streamed series of speakers in lieu of a physical rally, is a sign that the protests at Amazon’s warehouses have galvanized portions of the company’s white-collar workforce. 
The protest is in part a result of Amazon’s aggressive response to worker organizing. In recent weeks, Amazon has fired six workers who have called for better safety precautions during the pandemic, including two long-time user experience designers. Both were prominent members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and had publicly voiced support for improving warehouse conditions. The two tech workers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, were fired shortly after a colleague sent an email inviting employees to an online event featuring warehouse workers speaking about their experience. (That employee had already given his two-weeks’ notice but had his network access terminated, Costa says.) More than 1,500 employees RSVP’d to the event, but it was quickly deleted from their calendars along with the email. 
“I was so shocked, I was shaking,” says Costa, who spent 15 years at the company and was fired in a brief video call. Costa says the HR representative told her she had violated the company’s non-solicitation policy, possibly referring to an email about warehouse working conditions she and Cunningham forwarded to colleagues in late March. She believes she was fired for speaking out, and that the firings show how threatened Amazon is by the prospect of its tech workforce collaborating with the warehouse employees from whom they are typically isolated. “They are absolutely siloed, and intentionally so,” Costa says. “Obviously, we tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”
In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company supports “every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies.” The spokesperson said Amazon terminated Cunningham and Costa for “repeatedly violating internal policies” but did not specify which ones. Amazon did not comment on the deleted emails and calendar events. 
“We tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”


The panel went forward and approximately 400 employees attended, along with warehouse workers from Minnesota, California, Poland, and elsewhere. But the firings prompted employees to organize a second event, this one a protest. “It’s like a walkout, but in the time of COVID, because we can’t really walk out together,” Costa says of the sick out. Instead, they will have a series of speakers — warehouse workers, as well as the writers Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben — discussing the pandemic, the climate crisis, racism, and Amazon’s retaliation against workers. It will be live streamed over the course of the day. “You can come for 10 minutes or stay for the day, or stay home and watch Friends reruns. We don’t care, but we actually have proper programming,” Costa says. 
“If they’re keeping everyone safe what do they have to hide?” 

The second event has also met with resistance from Amazon. Tuesday night, an employee emailed an invitation that was quickly deleted. A software engineer in Seattle who asked to remain anonymous “given Amazon’s recent history of retaliation” checked his email after receiving the invitation, only to have it vanish ten minutes later. He had found the earlier panel “eye opening,” particularly the disparity in how tech workers and warehouse workers are being treated during the pandemic: while he and his colleagues were sent home immediately after a coronavirus case was confirmed at Amazon’s headquarters, warehouse workers aren’t being informed when coworkers test positive and social distancing is haphazardly enforced. 
“Now that Amazon is firing tech workers for trying to connect with logistics workers, and going so far as to delete calendar invites to events where tech workers can hear directly about conditions from warehouse workers, it makes you wonder, if they’re keeping everyone safe, what do they have to hide?” the engineer says. 
Amazon has been vocal about the safety measures it has instituted over the course of the pandemic. In previous statements, the company has touted the “extreme measures” it has taken to keep its workers safe, including mandatory social distancing, increased cleaning, and more than a hundred other policy and operational changes. 
“It’s very clearly retaliation.” 

But workers say the safety measures have been far from adequate. Their jobs still frequently take them in close proximity to each other, and people are continuing to fall ill. Yesterday, workers at JFK8, the Staten Island fulfillment center that was the site of the first walkout, received a notification that seven employees had been newly diagnosed with COVID-19, bringing the total count to at least 27, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Amazon has declined to say how many workers at how many facilities have fallen ill, so workers and activists have been left to compile statistics from alerts and news reports. The group United for Respect says at least 130 facilities have confirmed coronavirus cases, some with more than 30 workers diagnosed with the virus. 
Amazon has a history of responding aggressively to worker organizing. Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that the company uses a heat map to predict which Whole Foods locations are most likely to unionize. Yet the company has never needed workers more, as it races to hire tens of thousands of people to meet surging demand and replace workers who have chosen to stay home. The result has been a dissonant public response. After workers at JFK8 walked out, Amazon fired the organizer, dismissed the protesters’ claims — and then made many of the changes they had called for. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed executives planning to smear the organizer, Christian Smalls, and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.” Throughout, Amazon has publicly referred to its workers as “heroes.” 
The company has fired outspoken workers at warehouses in Minnesota and Pennsylvania as well. Amazon denies these firings are connected to the workers’ activism, pointing instead to policy violations. But employees say policies are being selectively enforced to target organizers. After workers walked out in Chicago, several of them were given write-ups for violating a 6-foot social distancing rule, even though the impossibility of maintaining social distancing in the warehouse was part of the reason they were protesting. (Employees at the facility filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, which is looking into the claims.) “All the reasons they’re giving for write-ups are issues that occur daily, but they’re only targeting people who participated in the action,” a worker there says. “It’s very clearly retaliation.” 
“Have backbone; disagree and commit.”

That worker is optimistic about the sick out. “I think that’s great organizing to connect tech and warehouse workers. We all have the same employer, just different workplaces and conditions,” he says. “They’re broadening the perspective on how to organize and how to collaborate with warehouse workers, and Amazon sees that and is attacking them for that.”
In the past, Amazon has been more tolerant of dissent among its tech workers, opting for warnings rather than terminations. That appears to have changed in recent weeks, with the firing of Costa and Cunningham. But it’s unclear whether this will be a sustainable strategy for Amazon. The company’s warehouse system is highly regimented in a way that makes workers easy to replace, all the more so in a bad economy. The job market for engineers is far more competitive; they have more leverage, and can leave more easily. 
“I’ve also seen many co-workers respond with outrage and dismay at the company’s retaliation against workers who’ve tried to sound the alarm on safety,” says the Seattle engineer. “Amazon claims to value dissent, but they’ve tried to silence workers to protect their own image — that goes against everything tech workers are taught about leadership.” (One of the company’s fourteen leadership principles is “Have backbone; disagree and commit.”) 
“It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”

“Tech workers aren’t used to being threatened by their employer, emails and calendar invites deleted when Amazon wants to silence someone, firing long-time senior employees to save face,” the engineer says. “It shocked a lot of people. It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”
Costa plans to continue her activism from the outside, both on climate and workers’ rights, which she sees as intertwined. Despite her firing, she still thinks like a long-time employee — talking about Amazon, she kept referring to the company with “we,” before catching herself, and she expresses chagrin at what she sees as a squandered opportunity in Amazon’s coronavirus response. 
“No company is benefiting more than Amazon right now, the stock is hitting an all-time high, and they could have also been the hero in people’s hearts, they could have set the bar high for how you treat essential workers in the time of COVID,” she says. “I really was trying to make Amazon a better company, for my kids, and for the company I worked for for 15 years.”"

Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge
Two weeks after beginning to survey users about disease symptoms in an effort to track the spread of COVID-19, Facebook said Monday that early results showed promise and that the effort will roll out internationally beginning Wednesday. Carnegie Mellon University, which conducts the survey, said that 150,000 people a day are now submitting symptom reports after clicking on a link in the News Feed. The university does not share any information about symptoms back to Facebook.
In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that initial findings shared by Carnegie Mellon correlate with public data about confirmed cases of COVID-19, an important signal that symptom surveys will soon be able to forecast the diseases spread. Facebook will use aggregated data from the university to produce interactive maps based on symptom surveys and will update them daily.
Ive always believed that helping people come together as a community will help us address our greatest challenges not just by sharing our experiences and supporting each other in crises but also by working together at scale to solve problems, Zuckerberg wrote. The world has faced pandemics before, but this time we have a new superpower: the ability to gather and share data for good. If we use it responsibly, Im optimistic that data can help the world respond to this health crisis and get us started on the road to recovery.
Facebook also announced a partnership with the University of Maryland to begin collecting symptom data globally. If Facebook users report symptoms in their own countries at rates similar to their participation in the United States, the data could prove to be an effective map of potential hotspots around the globe, said Ryan Tibshirani, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who is helping to lead the schools partnership with Facebook.
In an interview with The Verge, Zuckerberg said that global maps could serve as a reality check in places where elected officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of COVID-19 within their borders.
Some of these governments, frankly, are not excited about the world knowing how many actual cases there might be, or indicators of how its spreading in their countries, Zuckerberg said. So getting that data out there is very important.
As the pandemic has spread around the world, Zuckerberg has sought to demonstrate how Facebooks massive global reach can be used to help elected leaders and public health officials make more informed decisions about their pandemic response. Last month, Facebook began inserting a COVID-19 Information Center into the News Feed, showing users vetted information from public health authorities. More than 350 million people have used the center to date, Zuckerberg said.
The moves come as Facebook remains under scrutiny for its practices related to competition, data privacy, and allowing the spread of misinformation. The company is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of states attorney general over antitrust and privacy issues.
As the pandemic worsens, Facebook has worked to show how aggregated, anonymized data collected at global scale can be a force for good. Earlier this month the company also released mobility maps that use smartphone location to illustrate the degree to which Americans are complying with state stay-at-home orders. (Google has released a similar tool using its own location data.)
At the same time, the company has come under continued criticism for its role in spreading misinformation related to the coronavirus, and more recently for its use in organizing protests against stay-at-home orders. On some level, Facebooks corporate initiatives to reduce the harms generated by the pandemic are undermined by the behavior of its user base and at this point its unclear which of those will prove more consequential in the end. 
In a separate announcement on Monday, Facebook announced additional partnerships with researchers to use machine learning techniques to do additional forecasting. In New York, the company is working with New York University and Cornell University to create forecasts for the spread of the disease at the county level, as well as predictions for how a rise in cases will affect demand for services, ventilators, and personal protective equipment at area hospitals. One approach will use machine learning technology from Facebook to analyze de-identified X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) scans in an effort to predict patient outcomes and equipment demand.
Zuckerberg said that while Facebook would not seek to interpret the symptom data it shares with researchers, its size has enabled it to make a significant contribution to the public health response. 
What we can do is help them get a survey out to a large number of people quickly, and on a daily basis, he said. Since we have a basic understanding of who people are, we can make sure that its sampled properly. Were in a relatively unique position where I dont think that there are that many institutions in the world that could stand up a survey like this across the country, much less across the world."

 In January, early reports out of China started to hint that people infected with the coronavirus were contagious before they started to show symptoms. That’s unusual for a respiratory virus like this one, and it worried public health experts all over the world: it’s much harder to control the spread of a disease if someone who has it can pass it along before they know they’re sick.
It’s since become clear that, yes, it’s possible for people who don’t feel sick to infect other people. What scientists still don’t know, though, is how often it happens. And that matters for managing the pandemic: if only a few people spread COVID-19 when they’re symptom-free, missing them probably won’t have a big impact on the course of the pandemic. If most people do, though, it’s more important to track them all down. 
For months, there have been regular dust-ups over just how likely it is for people without symptoms to spread COVID-19. The latest quarrel stemmed from vague comments by a World Health Organization expert at a press conference. After the expert suggested that asymptomatic transmission was “very rare,” the organization eventually stated that they just don’t have enough information yet. Getting a clear answer will be hard. It takes careful, meticulous detective work to figure out how often people carry the virus without symptoms and how likely they are to pass it onto others when they feel healthy. 
It takes careful, meticulous detective work

That’s been done a handful of times in the past few months, says Mark Slifka, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University studying viral immunology. But it’s not enough, and we need far more data to settle the debate. 
No symptoms — yet
The confusion started in January when a report in The New England Journal of Medicine said that a German businessman had caught COVID-19 from a colleague visiting from Shanghai. The colleague, the report said, didn’t have any symptoms while she was in Germany. Some experts took that report as the first sign that someone without symptoms (the Shanghai woman) could pass the coronavirus on to someone else (her German colleague). 
It turned out, though, that she did have mild symptoms: she felt a bit feverish and tired, with minor aches, during those meetings. 
The first challenge researchers face around virus spread from people with no symptoms is reflected in the NEJM mistake: it’s hard to tell if someone truly does not have any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they just have very mild symptoms. Some signs of COVID-19 might be easy to brush off, and someone with a slight tickle in their throat might not think that they’re sick. If scientists are trying to find out if someone with a positive test is symptomatic or not, they often rely on that person to say how they feel. Those self-reported symptoms may not be accurate.
If someone truly does not have symptoms, the next step is checking to see if they ever end up developing them. Many studies of COVID-19 cases check in on people just once, when they initially test positive. If those people don’t feel sick, they can sometimes get classified as “asymptomatic.” Many of them, though, eventually end up developing symptoms later on, which scientists classify as “pre-symptomatic.” 
“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’”

“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’” Slifka says. 
In order to get good data on the number of people with the coronavirus who really, truly never feel sick, researchers have to track them for at least 14 days. (The latest people usually get sick after exposure to the virus.) Without that long-term information, the data is no good, said Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Saint Andrews, and other researchers in an open letter. 
Infectious or just infected
Once scientists have that long-term data, they can start checking to see how often asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people actually infect others. Studies show that people have high levels of the virus in their throats before they develop symptoms. People who never ended up developing symptoms also had copies of the virus floating around in their noses and throats, one study found, but at lower levels than people who eventually felt sick. 
Those studies show that people without symptoms could, theoretically, pass an infection onto someone else. They have copies of the virus in their nose and throat, and those virus copies could make their way over to another person through droplets of spit or the occasional sneeze. That doesn’t mean, though, that they actually will. The amount of virus in a person’s nose is still just an indirect way to measure how contagious they are, Slifka notes. “It doesn’t mean they’re a good spreader.” 
Someone who doesn’t feel sick probably isn’t coughing or sneezing, for example, says Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response. “One may argue that once symptoms start, and you’re coughing more, and you’re expelling more respiratory droplets, that that may increase your transmission,” he says. 
Information on the amount of virus floating around in people without symptoms and estimates on how many respiratory droplets they produce can be used to estimate how they could spread the virus. Those are just models, though, and they don’t directly answer the question. Finding out, conclusively, if anyone actually caught COVID-19 from someone without symptoms requires detailed tracking and even more testing. 
If a group of people is being tested regularly — like in a sports league, for example — it’s easier to re-create the order in which an infection passed from one person to another and when that happened, Karan says. “If this player became positive on this day, and then played in a game, and these other players became positive on days four and five, you can really trace it,” he says. 
Re-creating events within a household where everyone was only tested once is harder. If two members of a family test positive on the same day, and one has symptoms and the other does not, it’s impossible to know which direction the virus spread. 
researchers also have to exclude all other ways people could have possibly gotten sick

In order to say a person got sick because of someone else who tested positive but didn’t have symptoms, researchers also have to exclude all other ways they could have possibly gotten sick, noted Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida, on Twitter. That’s hard to do in places with high rates of infection. If the virus is circulating through a community, that person could have picked it up by touching a doorknob in a public place or at the supermarket, for example. 
A few research groups have managed to sort through all the clutter. One such study followed people who contracted the virus while working at a call center in South Korea. During the investigation, some workers had symptoms, some developed symptoms later, and some never developed symptoms. No one who came into contact with the workers when they did not have symptoms ended up catching the virus. Another detailed study that carefully traced the path of infection for 157 people with COVID-19 in Singapore found that only 10 were infected by someone who hadn’t yet developed symptoms. 
No good answers
That early data suggests that, even if they have the virus in their nose, people who don’t have symptoms yet or who never get symptoms spread the coronavirus less frequently than people with symptoms. The studies are small, though, and aren’t enough to say for sure who is or isn’t likely to spread COVID-19. 
They also don’t change what scientists know: some people do spread the coronavirus before they develop symptoms or without developing symptoms at all. Before there’s more evidence, that’s enough for public health experts to recommend that everyone wear masks, even if they feel fine, in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. “We have to play it as conservatively as possible,” Karan says. 
“We have to play it as conservatively as possible.”

The coronavirus is still very new, and scientists still have a lot to learn about it. 
“We’re still figuring this out, we don’t have complete certainty on the exact amount of spread from pre-symptomatic cases, or asymptomatic, or symptomatic,” Karan says. “That’s why, while we’re still learning about the proportion of transmission by these different groupings, that we wear masks in high risk situations very consistently.”
While we’re taking those steps, researchers should keep searching for better data, Slifka says. In areas with low rates of COVID-19, public health officials can do the detailed contact tracing necessary to figure out if someone caught the virus from someone without symptoms. The more testing states and cities do, the more likely they are to find the people who are walking around carrying the virus without any symptoms. 
“We should be monitoring each of the cases, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic and symptomatic, and checking for that secondary attack rate,” Slifka says. “Then we’ll have an answer.”"

 In May, we saw the arrival of the first viral hoax of the COVID-19 era: “Plandemic,” a meandering 26-minute video which falsely asserted that vaccines “weaken” people’s immune systems and that wearing a mask would “activate” the coronavirus. Despite the best efforts of Facebook and YouTube, a single upload of “Plandemic” got 7.1 million views before it was removed. 
As I wrote at the time, the problem was not that the platforms were ignoring the video — it was that, at their scale, even the few hours it took them to research the issue were enough for “Plandemic” to get all the way around the world. “It likely won’t be the last piece of harmful misinformation about COVID-19 that becomes a blockbuster,” I wrote back then. “And when the next one comes, I wouldn’t be surprised to see that the pathway to virality leads straight through Facebook groups.”
Indeed, on Monday we got the sequel. And Facebook groups played a significant role. 
The video that captured the public imagination this week lacks a name as catchy as “Plandemic” — it was a live stream of a press conference organized by a group known as the Tea Party Patriots, who are funded by wealthy Republicans — but it was seen much more widely, in much less time. Here’s Sam Shead at CNBC: 

The video was created by right-wing media outlet Breitbart. It depicts a group of people dressed in white lab coats — who call themselves “America’s Frontline Doctors” — staging a press conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Those in the video claim that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is “a cure for Covid” and “you don’t need a mask” to slow the spread of coronavirus. 

“This virus has a cure, it’s called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,” one of the women in the video claims. “You don’t need masks, there is a cure.” 


All of that is false, but falls squarely into the category of “something people desperately want to believe,” and so it found a wide audience. NBC News’ Brandy Zadrozny reported that in less than 24 hours, it racked up 20 million views on Facebook alone. 
“That Breitbart video from the doctors claiming that hydroxychloroquine cures the coronavirus has been going crazy in anti-vax, anti-mask, reopen Facebook Groups today,” she tweeted. “It’s at >20 mil views on FB. And that doesn’t include all the private groups it’s been spreading through.”
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter all began efforts to remove the video — although, as we have come to understand, this will be an ongoing effort, as people continue to make minor alterations to the video and re-upload it. (The platforms are still finding new uploads of “Plandemic,” more than two months later.) 
And it took Facebook longer than even the company thought it should have. Here’s what the company told me about it when I asked:
“We’ve removed this video for making false claims about cures and prevention methods for COVID-19. People who reacted to, commented on, or shared this video, will see messages directing them to authoritative information about the virus. It took us several hours to enforce against the video and we’re doing a review to understand why this took longer than it should have. Since April to June we removed more than 7 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram for violating our policy against sharing harmful COVID-19 misinformation.”

Compounding the challenge for the platforms is that the video was shared by two of their most high-profile users: the president and his son. Twitter put temporary limits on the account of Donald Trump Jr., and removed several retweets of the video that President Trump himself had shared on Twitter. Here are Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford in the Washington Post:

Twitter said it ordered the president’s son to delete the misleading tweet and said it would “limit some account functionality for 12 hours.” [...]

Twitter removed the videos, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared, and even adding a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use.


By now you may be wondering on whose expertise the president and the president’s son have staked their reputations on promoting a COVID-19 treatment that the Food and Drug Administration has said is “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19.” The group of doctors who appeared in the live stream is known as America’s Frontline Doctors, which made a website less than two weeks ago. Its breakout star is named Stella Immanuel, and I’ll let Will Sommer at the Daily Beast tell you about her: 

Immanuel, a pediatrician and a religious minister, has a history of making bizarre claims about medical topics and other issues. She has often claimed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches. 

She alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are cooking up a vaccine to prevent people from being religious. And, despite appearing in Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress on Monday, she has said that the government is run in part not by humans but by “reptilians” and other aliens.


So on one hand, yes, this is a platform problem. Because the platforms are so large, and because viral distribution mechanisms are built into every post, dangerous misinformation can spread globally within hours. For reasons I still don’t quite understand, the Immanuel video racked up nearly three times the views that the most-shared “Plandemic” video did in half the time. And that’s despite the heightened attention every platform has been paying to misinformation related to COVID-19.
It’s also a democracy problem. When the president of the United States is sharing videos that encourage people to believe that a “cure” exists for a disease that has already — needlessly — killed 151,000 Americans, the issue extends well beyond tech companies’ content moderation policies and enforcement efforts. And he reiterated some of these claims in a press conference Tuesday, which was carried on cable news — and not subject to whatever rules Facebook or Twitter want to make about COVID-19 posts. Everything about this presidency is a crisis, and platforms have their role to play in mitigating its very worst excesses, and yet to think about this only as a problem of content moderation would be far too blinkered. 
Still, the speed at which Immanuel’s rant spread offers cause for concern. When I asked Facebook today why this video seemed to spread so quickly, no one could give me an answer. The company often points to the huge investment it has made in trust and safety, arguing that breaking it up would only worsen the spread of harmful content on the internet. But when Dr. Demon Sex can get 20 million views hawking dangerous advice in an afternoon, what exactly do we have to lose?

Governing
⭐ The United States is seeking to dismiss the charges it brought against two former Twitter employees and a Saudi national for allegedly helping the Saudi Arabian government spy on dissidents using Twitter. Given how politicized the Department of Justice has become under Bill Barr, it’s hard not to read this story and assume corruption is involved. An outrageous story, reported by Clare Roth and Peter Bloomberg:

Prosecutors in San Francisco on Tuesday asked for a judge’s permission to drop the charges. The two-page filing doesn’t offer a reason but specifies that the dismissal would be “without prejudice,” meaning the government could file new charges.

The two former Twitter employees, Ahmad Abouammo and Ali Alzabarah, were accused of feeding the Saudi government information about Twitter users critical of it. They were recruited by a Saudi named Ahmed Almutairi, who lives in the kingdom and has worked for the royal family’s social media company, according to prosecutors. All three were charged with acting as illegal foreign agents. Of the three, only Abouammo, a U.S. citizen, is in custody. He has pleaded not guilty.


⭐ Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are preparing for their “Big Tobacco moment” on Wednesday, says Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the FCC. He’s referring to the 1994 congressional hearing where seven executives from America’s largest tobacco companies said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive. On the other hand, that hearing was not about antitrust! Anyway, here’s Cecilia Kang, Jack Nicas and David McCabe at The New York Times:

The hearing, which caps a 13-month investigation by the House subcommittee, will be closely watched for clues that could advance other antitrust cases against the companies. The Federal Trade Commission, for one, is preparing to depose Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives in its 13-month probe of the social network. The Justice Department may soon unveil a case against Google. And an investigation into Apple by state attorneys general also appears to be advancing.

As a result, preparations for the hearing have been frenetic — even with the event postponed by a few days this week to accommodate the commemoration of Representative John Lewis — as tech lobbyists jockeyed behind the scenes to influence the types of questions that lawmakers might ask.


A Senate subcommittee held a hearing on the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act, which would reform Section 230 by making social networks by creating new mandatory disclosures for technology companies. There is some bipartisan agreement here, but members of Congress are weirdly fixated on platforms declaring “neutrality,” whatever that means. (Adi Robertson / The Verge)

⭐ Instagram is trying to lure TikTok stars over to its new competing app Reels with deals potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Facebook is planning to unveil Reels next month. Here’s Euirim Choi at The Wall Street Journal:

The Instagram overtures to creators are the latest in a continuing back-and-forth between the two social-media giants. In recent years, TikTok has flooded Facebook and Instagram with ads, targeting their users on the home turf of the social media company.

To counter the Instagram push, TikTok announced a $200 million fund on Thursday that will help creators on the platform “realize additional earnings that help reward the care and dedication they put into creatively connecting with an audience that’s inspired by their ideas.”

 Massive PPE shortages pushed DIY volunteers to get creative On March 20th, as the coronavirus situation in New York City hurtled toward full-blown crisis, Madiha Choksi was packing a taxi with two Flashforge 3D printers and as much filament as she could fit. 
Choksi, a librarian specializing in research and educational technology, had received an urgent email the night before from Pierre Elias, a cardiology fellow at NYP-Columbia University Medical Center. Elias desperately needed to produce more protective gear for hospital workers treating COVID-19 patients. He hoped Choksi, the administrator for Columbia University’s 3D printing lab, might be able to help. 
“The email was very long and really concerning,” Choksi tells The Verge. Normally, she could help. “But I don’t have any printers,” she remembers thinking, “and we were already on day three or four of remote work.”
“The email was very long and really concerning.”

Thankfully, Columbia handed over its printers. “Within hours, they were like, ‘Yeah, of course,’” she says. Choksi got to work in her apartment producing prototype face shields by modifying an open-source design, from a company called Budmen Industries, and 3D printing the plastic visor that holds the shield and rests on the forehead with a piece of foam-like material in between. She used supplies purchased from Staples to slap together about six units she then handed off to Elias a day after receiving the email from the doctor. 
“He took them straight to the hospital and tested them out,” she says, “and he came back and said, ‘Can we have 1,000 more?’”

The US continues to struggle to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, both at a state and federal level. So DIY efforts from academics, hobbyists, manufacturing experts, and professional firms have coalesced around COVID hotspots like New York City to meet the needs of health care workers and others on the front line of the response effort. 
Some of these initiatives are highly organized, involving partnerships across state lines to source materials and make use of industrial-grade manufacturing facilities. Yet almost all began in the living rooms of people with access to a 3D printer and the ingenuity to put together stopgap measures as existing supply lines struggled to keep up.
“In a perfect world, we have coordination across the nation, where we have hotspots and we focus the resources there so the health care workers are protected and patients are protected. And as that dies down, we ship what remains to the next location,” says James Hudspeth, an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University and a COVID response lead at Boston Medical Center.
“The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth.”

That ideal world is far from reality. Face shields, which Hudspeth says are rarely used in standard medical environments outside surgeries and very select procedures, ended up being second in demand only to face masks, which have also been in short supply. “One way people get infected is by touching surfaces and then touching the face or mask. The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth,” Hudspeth explains.
The problem is that shields are only made by a limited number of manufacturers, some domestic but many overseas. And large manufacturers only ship units in batches based on orders from procurement offices of large medical institutions and local and state governments. 
“We have a central supply, and some of the states have the supply. But there isn’t the capacity to dictate where privately produced or purchased stuff is going,” Hudspeth says. “States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.” That’s left doctors, nurses, and health care workers across the nation scrambling to get as much PPE as they can, regardless of where it comes from. 
“States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.”

A face shield of the DIY variety typically consists of a molded or printed plastic semi-circle visor, sometimes called a bracket, that is attached often by glue to a piece of foam that rests on the forehead. The unit then attaches to a long sheet of transparent plastic film that sits just above the face. 
Everything is held together with a rubber band or a similar elastic device. It’s a simple way to protect someone’s face when interacting with a potentially COVID-positive patient. These shields can be cheaply manufactured, easily sanitized, and then reused. They also aren’t as complicated or bound by regulatory restrictions as, say, respiratory face masks. 
The lack of regulations surrounding face shields have made them an attractive option for manufacturers large and small looking for a way to pitch in. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced in early April that his company would produce tens of millions of face shields for California health care workers, and Apple’s website now features a tutorial for assembling the units.

In the Pacific Northwest, Nike, which has its headquarters just outside Portland, has repurposed materials and manufacturing processes for its running shoes to produce face shields, too. Countless other companies, from Jeff Bezos-funded rocket outfit Blue Origin to Alphabet’s life sciences division Verily, are putting resources toward emergency face shield production. 
The efforts aren’t stopping at just shields but extending to face masks and even ventilators, too. Razer, the gaming accessory maker, even built its own automated face mask production line in Singapore, equipped with vending machines for dispensing them around the city-state. 
It doesn’t hurt that out of all the PPE in short supply during COVID-19, face shields are among the easiest to produce — a single unit can be constructed with basic materials by anyone with a 3D printer or even a laser or waterjet cutter. “The nice thing about shields is that they’re easy to produce relatively quickly,” Hudspeth says. “People who have larger 3D printers and a relatively basic piece of plastic that is flexible enough to bend can make a face shield.” 
Nearly two months after she’d received that first, frantic email, Choksi and her fellow Columbia University librarians Alex Gil and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira now run a DIY volunteer effort called COVID Maker Response. So far, the group has assembled more than 19,000 face shields and distributed units to over 50 institutions, including hospitals, clinics, fire departments, and other groups of first responders. 
The operation now has an almost factory-like scale and sophistication. They moved from Choksi’s apartment to the 92nd Street Y, a historic community center in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. They have two official manufacturing partners: 3D printing design firm Tangible Creative, out of Newark, New Jersey, and Brooklyn-based 3D printer creator MakerBot. 
Both firms supply the single 3D-printed visor to which the shield attaches. After receiving the parts in large batches, Choksi has a group of 10 to 12 volunteers, mostly medical students, on four-hour shifts assembling the shields and ferrying them by taxi or car to hospitals.

Gil and de Sá Pereira, both data librarians and scholars specializing in areas like data visualization and digital mapping, have experience in rapid crisis response through their academic careers. Now, Gil handles incoming face shield requests and spends all day in communication with hospitals. And de Sá Pereira is helping manage the operation’s resources and ensuring they’re using Columbia’s funding as efficiently as possible. The rest of their limited free time is spent helping other groups in the US and overseas start their own DIY operations. 
“When this whole thing hit, first and foremost in most of our minds was the lack of PPE, which was pretty harrowing in those early days,” says Jason Hill, an emergency room doctor at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “In particular, I had a pretty crazy overnight very early on where I had to intubate,” he says, referring to the insertion of a tube into the body, “in the middle of the night without one of the face shields. It was early on and nobody was expecting the onslaught to be that intense at the time, and we burned through our entire stash during the day.”
Uptown at the Harlem Hospital Center, Stephen Nicholas, a doctor who came out of retirement to help treat patients during COVID-19, watched as the PPE shortage was fast becoming a crisis of its own. 
“After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly.”

“I cannot tell you how horrible it was,” he says of the situation in late March. His hospital began using a special emergency code, “777 Gold,” over the loudspeaker when a COVID-19 patient had entered respiratory arrest and needed staff attention immediately. The “gold” was to tell hospital workers to wear appropriate PPE due to the heightened risk of infection, but the building was burning through its stash of face masks at an alarming rate. “There were periods every 20 minutes you would hear overhead, ‘777 Gold.’” 
Nicholas, a former professor at Columbia, heard about Choksi’s efforts through his daughter, a medical student at the school. Gil began helping the doctor coordinate face shield deliveries for his colleagues. “After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly,” Nicholas says. “Second batch was 200. I was out of those in a day and a half. Next was 500, and that lasted about two days.” He says the PPE shortage is no longer as much an issue now that most workers have their own shields they can sanitize and hold onto. 
Hill, the ER doctor, also found his way to Choksi’s group through word of mouth. He says, as the crisis accelerated, every doctor became acutely aware that acquiring more PPE as fast as possible would be crucial to keeping health care workers safe. COVID Maker Response is now helping supply his hospital with hundreds of these shields every week. 
“Every few days, I’ll gauge the needs for our particular ERs and ICUs with some colleges and we’ll swing by and get a box of 200 or so of these face shields to drop off,” he says. “When I walk through the ER, the vast majority of people I see are wearing these face shields. At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.” 
“At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.”

COVID Maker Response is far from the only operation like this. Choksi and Gil tell me they’ve been in contact with at least three others around New York City alone, and they continue to field messages from others around the country and even overseas that are interested in doing the same. 
Countless groups have also spun up elsewhere in the US, typically around schools and libraries with the space and resources to set up these makeshift factories. Some, like the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub and the Illinois PPE Network, have taken similar approaches to coordinating massive, factory-like volunteer efforts that employ individuals in their homes all the way to corporate partners and universities. 
“Part of our model is not to become the one supplier of face shields,” says Gil. “The idea of this grassroots, distributed model is to help others be able to do what you’re doing so many more distributed teams can aggregate to some kind of impact. This is of course in the absence of industry or city stepping in.”

One hurdle facing the PPE-producing projects is knowing when to shut them down, as more conventional manufacturing methods continue to ramp up. Choksi and Gil say they’re still receiving daily requests for more face shields, and shortages will continue so long as the novel coronavirus continues to overwhelm the US health care system and its hospital and other frontline workers. 
“I think we’re just going to keep going until the need dies down,” Choksi says. “There’s so many other efforts we’re hearing about, and until we stop receiving requests, our plan is to just keep at it. Full speed ahead until the needs are met.”
For Choksi and her partners at COVID Maker Response, the willingness for her volunteers and partners to keep helping has been one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise awful and often grim situation. She says the maker community and 3D printing in general have shown that they can fill gaps and help vulnerable communities in times of need, using their expertise and ingenuity.

“I think the situation has really shown what 3D printing is capable of, which is not long-term mass production, but filling a need for very rapid production, on-demand and highly customized items,” says Dave Veisz, MakerBot’s vice president of engineering, who now works closely with COVID Maker Response on the volunteer effort. “[COVID-19] has just shown the vulnerability in the global supply chain. The fact that these parts are needed so badly has been eye-opening, as well as the fact that a lot of these parts only come from a handful of factories.”
Veisz says that under normal circumstances, you would just injection mold a face shield design and have a factory spin up to mass produce it. “But these things take months,” he says. “It’s been eye-opening to the general public that 3D printing can be used as a stopgap for emergency needs like this and can be used to kickoff production for the item.”
Choksi says the novel coronavirus has been the kind of situation the maker community prides itself on coming together to fight. “It’s very organized and mobilized and fast moving and constantly iterating. If there is an emergency, a need for crisis response, there is a file out there that is open source, readily available for everyone,” she says. “We’re just humbled and grateful to put our wits and expertise to it and just go.”"

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Amazon is reopening its six distribution centers in France beginning today, according to a reporter from CNN. The company shut down the warehouses in April due to a labor dispute with workers who alleged that the internet retailer wasnt doing enough to protect them from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The six warehouses are set to gradually reopen starting today, according to an Amazon spokesperson speaking to CNN. 
Amazon closed all six of its French warehouses on April 15th after a French court issued a ruling that threatened to fine the company 1 million per item for shipping out anything other than medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. 
The court ruling came after a complaint from French unions representing Amazons workers who argued that the warehouses were too crowded and that Amazon wasnt doing enough to protect them from the virus. Amazon argued that its operations were complex and varied and that the the risk was too high to try to only ship products that met the court ruling hence the total shutdown for the past month. 
A statement posted by the CFDT Services union gives more details on the agreement, which includes health guarantees, a voluntary return to work for workers, adjusted schedules to help with distancing, and increased pay of 2 per hour through the end of May. 
Despite reopening in France, Amazon continues to struggle with safe work conditions for its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there have been seven known COVID-19 deaths of employees at Amazon warehouses. The company is also being frustratingly opaque about how many workers have actually been infected or died from the virus, with Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark calling statistics on infections not a particularly useful number. Amazon has also fired some of its employees who staged a walkout over safety concerns, which led to a senior engineer and vice president resigning from the company in protest."

President Trump has suggested that the coronavirus outbreak will be gone by April because the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus, as reported by USA Today. He has appointed Vice President Pence to take charge of the U.S. response to the disease.
But, will the coronavirus be responsive to seasonal changes similar to the flu?
In short, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the spread of the disease will abate with warmer weather. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) notes that at this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.
COVID-19 is different from the virus strains that cause the flu even though it can lead to similar symptoms of respiratory problems. 
So, to glean some insights, we need to look backwards to comparable outbreaks.
The SARS epidemic, which spread in 2002 across Asia, started in November and continued into July. The outbreak was contained comparatively quickly only 8,000 people worldwide were infected. 
MERS began in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, a country with relatively higher temperatures. We dont see too much evidence of seasonality in MERS, Stuart Weston, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told National Geographic.
The CDC says it is is simply too soon to know how COVID-19 will react when it first encounters warmer springtime temperatures."

Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)A dispiriting couple of weeks in the lives of music fans have now climaxed with the death of Bill Withers, whose lean, leathery-tough vocals on such pop classics as ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" ""Use Me,"" ""Just the Two of Us"" and ""Lean on Me"" were deeply woven into the soundtracks of several generations' lives. 
Withers died Monday at 81 of what his family has described as ""heart complications."" His death has not been linked to the Covid-19 virus. But his loss, coming at about the same time that ""Lean on Me"" has resurfaced as a global anthem of collective will during the coronavirus pandemic, nonetheless feels like another in an already seemingly relentless series of recent body blows to the music world. 
Among the casualties: Adam Schlesinger, Fountains of Wayne founding member, lead vocalist and songwriter; Joe Diffie, Grammy-winning country-music singer; Alan Merrill, best known for writing Joan Jett's 1980s anthem, ""I Love Rock and Roll;"" Manu Dibango, a Cameroon saxophonist whose riffs on the hit 1972 dance tune, ""Soul Makossa,"" helped spearhead worldwide interest in African pop; and Aurlus Mabelle, the Congolese song-and-dance man dubbed king of the eclectic blend of black pop genres known as ""soukous."" 
Of all music genres, however, it is jazz that's been struck especially hard and deep by Covid-19. Four musicians of varied ages have died in the last few weeks from the disease, the most recent of which are Ellis Marsalis and Bucky Pizzarelli, two master instrumentalists who found widespread fame relatively late in their storied careers and also passed their legacies on to their children. 
Marsalis, who was 85, was a fixture in his native New Orleans as a pianist doggedly advancing the cause of bop and other post-1940s jazz music in a city more inclined to embrace the pre-swing era of the 1920s. Over time, Marsalis' commitment, chops and reputation as a music educator won him respect and affection from the musical cognoscenti of his hometown. 
Of Marsalis' many prominent students, including Terrence Blanchard and Harry Connick Jr., the most celebrated were four of his six sons. The achievements of Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis were considerable enough to transform the Marsalises into the unofficial royal family of jazz. Along with their dad, they also were staunch and at times acerbic defenders of jazz tradition which by the time Branford and Wynton became breakout stars in the early 1980s, also encompassed the kind of hard bop music their father continued to play into his 70s and 80s. 
Bucky Pizzarelli, who died at 94, was a buoyantly lyrical guitarist who spent most of his early career as a session musician working in recording studios and with such bands as Benny Goodman's and the Tonight Show's NBC Orchestra. He became a fixture in New York nightclubs, playing in several small ensembles with such musicians as saxophonists Zoot Sims and Bud Freeman and violinists Joe Venuti and Stephane Grappelli. 
Most noteworthy of these professional affiliations was the one he shared with his son John, whose performances with his father, beginning in 1980 when John was 20, were also a kind of apprenticeship, enabling eventual renown in his own right as a guitarist and singer. Indeed, John Pizzarelli's fame reached the point that his dad proudly and happily played a supporting role in his son's own high-profile gigs. 
What made the deaths of these two father figures in jazz especially poignant was that they continued to play, teach and inspire deep into their senior years with the possibility of having even more to contribute to the music through the growth of their students.
Pianist Mike Longo, whose coronavirus-related death at 83 came March 22, was, along with Marsalis, a pianist and educator of comparable gifts and influence. His glittering resumé, including providing backup to saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and singer Nancy Wilson (among others), is dominated by his longtime association with trumpet great Dizzy Gillespie, who tapped him to be his musical director and arranger in 1966 and continued to work with him, formally and informally, until Gillespie's death in 1992. 
Besides his work as a writer, arranger and teacher, Longo directed the New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble, which he founded in 1998. He continued to perform music until almost the end of his life. 
Wallace Roney's death this past week at 59, hit the global jazz family especially hard because it came as he was building upon an already formidable reputation as a trumpeter, bandleader and composer. Along with Marsalis' two elder sons, Branford and Wynton, Roney was considered a prominent member of the so-called ""young lions"" at or near their 20s in the 1980s who were out to retrieve acoustic jazz music's once prominent place in the American mainstream. 
With his smoky blue tone, slippery timing and cagey dynamics, Roney was perceived at the outset as little more than a Miles Davis clone. Indeed, the usually truculent Davis enthusiastically declared Roney his protégé. Those listening closer, however, would hear other influences, from Clark Terry to Freddie Hubbard, filtering through Roney's playing. Over decades, Roney's voice would achieve a gritty agility and pensive romanticism that belonged to him and him alone. His intelligent and at times startling negotiations between jazz's past and present implied a future of greater glories -- now shockingly, painfully made inaccessible by pandemic. 
No one knows how long this coronavirus siege will last, or who else we may lose. But one can hope that the spaces left open by these musicians' deaths will be occupied over time not only with fresh new voices, but with a wider, deeper appreciation of how jazz nurtures and nourishes many lives at once -- maybe even your own, if you let it."

In May, a viral video that falsely claimed masks make people sick and that the coronavirus was created in a lab racked up millions of views before Facebook removed it. The scenario repeated itself last month when another video, which falsely claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure” for COVID-19, got more than 20 million views in a single day before Facebook took action against it. In both cases, copies of the videos continued to spread across Facebook and Instagram well after the removals began.

Some of his ominous predictions are now playing out as the deadly coronavirus spreads around the globe. The virus causes a disease known as COVID-19, which has killed almost 2,900 people and infected more than 83,000 others globally since December.
""In the past week, COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been worried about,"" Gates wrote in a new op-ed for the New England Journal of Medicine. ""I hope it's not that bad, but we should should assume it will be until we know otherwise.""
Gates referred to the outbreak as a pandemic, even though the World Health Organization has not yet made that declaration. The group has said instead that the virus has ""pandemic potential.""
""In any crisis, leaders have two equally important responsibilities: solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again,"" Gates wrote. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. We need to save lives.""
In the op-ed, Gates suggested the following list of solutions that could help slow the virus' spread:
<ul><li>Wealthy countries should supply low- and middle-income countries in Africa and southern Asia with trained healthcare workers to monitor the virus' spread and deliver vaccines. </li><li>Establish an international database where countries can share information.</li><li>Develop a system that screens for compounds that have already been safety-tested to use in a potential vaccine.</li><li>Governments and donors should fund manufacturing facilities that can pump out vaccines within weeks. </li></ul>Gates compared COVID-19 to the 1957 flu pandemic, which killed more than 1 million people, and the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people. The current outbreak, he wrote, is somewhere in-between. 
Gates predicted that large-scale trials for a coronavirus vaccine could happen as early as June. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's infectious-disease center, recently said that he hopes to start testing vaccine candidates in people by mid-April.
Associated Press
However, drug development is typically a multiyear process that can cost roughly $1 billion in the US. Gates said making vaccines affordable for everyone is the ""right strategy"" for containing the coronavirus outbreak.
""Given the economic pain that an epidemic can impose — we're already seeing how COVID-19 can disrupt supply chains and stock markets, not to mention people's lives — it will be a bargain,"" he wrote.
On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to promise that a future coronavirus vaccine would be affordable for all Americans. But he backtracked day later, saying that any vaccine developed in conjunction with the US government would need to be financially accessible to the public. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already contributed $100 million toward the fight to contain the outbreak. In his op-ed, Gates said warding off a pandemic will require billions of dollars. 
""There is no time to waste,"" he wrote.
Although China has seen a drop-off in its rate of new cases in recent days, the coronavirus has spread to at least 55 other countries. At least 72 people have died outside of mainland China.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Microsoft has launched a new interactive Bing map to provide information on the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The map shows the amount of cases on a per country basis, broken down by the number of currently active cases, recovered cases, and fatal cases. In the US, meanwhile, you can view information state-by-state. Selecting individual countries or states will provide links to relevant news stories and videos. Unfortunately, the stories being promoted arent always the most timely or useful to understand the current state of the evolving pandemic.
Microsoft says the tool is pulling data from a collection of sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and Wikipedia. The tool itself doesnt say how frequently its numbers are being updated, but at the time of publication we found the data to have been updated in the last hour.
In the UK, the tool surfaced an old video which claimed there were no cases in the country.
Image: Bing
Although the case numbers the tool is pulling are consistent with those published by the WHO, Microsofts COVID-19 tracker appears to be having trouble surfacing relevant news stories. When we tried to check news stories that were relevant to the outbreak in the UK, for example, one of the reports it surfaced was about a series of home improvement stores closing in France and Spain. Even more strangely, the lead video was an old news segment from January 24th with the title No confirmed cases of coronavirus yet in the United Kingdom, despite the tracker listing 1,391 cases in the country.
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the most recent article on the Dutch map (when viewed from The Netherlands) is two weeks old, despite the fact that the countrys government took the major decision to shut down public places including restaurants and schools just yesterday.
Microsoft isnt the only tech giant which is looking to provide information resources amidst the pandemic. Google has said it will launch a website late Monday with information about the outbreak, including how to prevent its spread and links to local resources. It is also providing information on the novel coronavirus on its homepage, and via YouTube and Maps. The company is also launching a limited coronavirus screening website, which is currently only available to people in the Bay Area of California, in contrast to the nationwide service that the US government suggested it was building on Friday."

Amazon Alexa users in the US can now use the voice assistant as a first step towards diagnosing cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Amazon has announced. Queries such as Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus? or Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19? will prompt the voice assistant to ask about your symptoms, travel history, and possible exposure to the virus. It will then offer advice based on official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information.
The functionality is a step up from the information Alexa was offering previously. Earlier this month, Vox reported that Alexa would list off simple facts. Amazons announcement follows a similar move from Apple, whose Siri voice assistant has also been updated to offer diagnosis advice.
Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?
As well as offering advice on symptoms, Alexa can now also be asked to sing a song for 20 seconds to help you know when youve properly washed your hands. Alexas subpar singing voice means we cant see people using the feature much for themselves, but it might motivate children. Amazon says the feature is available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, the UK, and the US. CNET reports that Google has also added a similar hand-washing timer to its voice assistant.
More generally, Amazon has also kept its fulfillment centers running, which has helped populations to follow shelter-at-home mandates. However, in some cases concerns have been raised about how its gone about this. Workers in the companys warehouses, which are still operating to fulfill orders, including the delivery of COVID-19 test kits in the UK, have reported that management hasnt been proactively informing them when colleagues have tested positive for the disease. Instead, theyve often been hearing about them through rumors. Amazon has also been criticized for not providing enough cleaning supplies in its warehouses, despite assuring workers that it has ramped up its cleaning procedures."

The ghost of Theranos is still haunting the biotech industry, even in the middle of a pandemic. A shell company called Labrador Diagnostics LLC, which says it holds the rights to two Theranos patents, sued a company making COVID-19 tests for patent infringement. The lawsuit asked the court to force the company, BioFire, to stop making its tests.

The shell company is owned by Fortress Investment Group, which bought the Theranos patents in 2018. Fortress Investment Group happens to be backed by SoftBank, which said this fall that it would spend billions to bail out WeWork before backpedaling on that deal this week. 
Soon after TechDirt reported on the lawsuit, though, Labrador Diagnostics LLC said that it would allow third parties to use its patented technology to develop COVID-19 tests though its unclear how valid its claims would have been. Labrador wants to make clear that the lawsuit was not directed to testing for COVID-19. The lawsuit focuses on activities over the past six years that are not in any way related to COVID-19 testing, the company wrote in a press release. 
This isnt the only unscrupulous legal action taken against people trying to fight back the novel coronavirus pandemic. Two Italian startup employees used their 3D printer to make valves for ventilators used to treat COVID-19 patients in a hard-hit Italian hospital, and the medical device company that normally sells the valves for $11,000 threatened to sue them.

Grocery delivery company Instacart says it will provide its full-service shoppers with health and safety kits days after some workers walked out over a lack of protection during the COVID-19 health crisis. The kits, which workers can request through an Instacart website starting next week, will contain a reusable cloth face mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. Face masks will also be provided to in-store shoppers at certain retail locations, according to the company. 
Providing protective equipment like face masks has been a key demand of Instacarts workers, who say it could prevent them from getting sick, or else becoming carriers of the virus. Shoppers previously threatened to walk out over the demands, although Instacart later claimed that it suffered no impact as a result of the strike. 
Gig Workers Collective wants more assurances on sick pay
The provisions come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to advise all Americans to start wearing face masks in public. Its a big shift from its previous guidance, which said that only sick people and medical workers should be using them. Now, however, there are concerns that people without symptoms may be carrying the virus, and that asking everyone to wear masks may help prevent infections.
Responding to the latest announcement, Gig Workers Collective called the safety kits a step in the right direction, but expressed concerns about how many kits are available, and how long it might take shoppers to receive them. In a blog post, the group noted that when hand sanitizer was offered on Instacarts internal online store for Shoppers it had immediately sold out. Instacart had previously promised to distribute independently-developed hand sanitizer to its workers.
Gig Workers Collective also expressed concerns that Instacarts measures still dont go far enough to protect vulnerable workers during the pandemic. In particular, it reiterated its demand for a hazard payment of $5 per order to cover the risks associated with working for the company, and for the default in-app tip amount to be set to at least 10 percent. 
It also demanded that workers with preexisting conditions who are more at risk from the virus be provided with sick pay if they have to stay home, and for sick leave to be made more accessible. Previously, Instacart has promised to offer up to 14 days paid sick leave for workers ill or quarantining as a result of COVID-19, but organizers said these measures didnt go far enough. Concerns were raised that a requirement to test positive for COVID-19 is of limited use when tests are in short supply and wouldnt help workers without health insurance.
Delivery services like Instacart have seen a huge spike in demand as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as people obey social distancing guidelines by sheltering at home. CNN reportsthat Instacart plans to hire an additional 300,000 independent contractors as a result of increased demand."

Amazon has decided to shut down all of its fulfillment centers in France after a French court ruled the company could be fined 1 million per item for shipping anything not directly related to medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. The company, which plans to appeal the ruling, says that at the moment the risk [is] too high that it will run afoul of the ruling due to complexities in its warehouse operations. The shutdown will last from at least April 16th to April 20th. Reuters originally published the news on Wednesday morning. 
Following the judgement of a French court on Tuesday, we have to temporarily suspend operations in our Fulfilment Centres in France. This is in spite of the huge investment we made in additional safety measures to keep our hard-working, dedicated colleagues safe, while ensuring they had continued employment at this difficult time, an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge in statement. Our FC operations are complex and varied, and with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high. We remain perplexed by the courts decision, which was made in spite of the overwhelming evidence we provided about the safety measures we have implemented, and have launched an appeal. 
with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high
Amazon has come under fire both in the US and overseas for its handling of health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis has only made the e-commerce giants services more vital as people shelter at home and rely more on online ordering and delivery of household goods, food, and other items. But more than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the Financial Times, and the company is now building its own testing lab to try to keep its operations running amid panic surrounding the viruss rapid spread through its warehouses. 
Throughout the crisis, Amazon has been criticized by workers, activists, and politicians for not properly communicating to warehouse workers when a co-worker has been diagnosed with the illness and for not taking enough precautionary measures to prevent the illness from spreading by closing down facilities and deep cleaning them. In some cases, Amazon workers say they only hear about a COVID-19 diagnosis from co-workers, and in Kentucky, the governor ordered Amazon to keep its returns facility closed after numerous confirmed cases among the workforce. 
In one particularly high-profile controversy, Amazon also fired a warehouse worker in New York City who organized a protest against the companys handling of health and safety issues related to COVID-19. The situation, in which Amazon claimed the worker violated the companys self-isolation guidelines to attend the protest, drew the attention of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and accusations of retaliation. It was later discovered Amazon executives internally planned how to smear the organizer in the media. 
In France, the Union Syndicale Solidaires trade union filed complaints pushing for more oversight of Amazons handling of health issues during the pandemic and calling for the closure of facilities due to overcrowding. Amazon now says it is asking its fulfillment center workers to stay home. Amazon employs about 10,000 people in warehouses in France, according to Reuters.
In the mean-time, we are working through what this courts decision means for them and our French operation, the statement reads. While we will do our best to minimize the impact on French small businesses, those who depend on our FC network to deliver their products will be negatively impacted by this ruling.
Amazon says it will continue to serve French customers using its Marketplace sellers and robust global fulfillment network. However, its not clear if that means French customers will have to order from Marketplace sellers outside the country and have those products shipped in without routing through a warehouse, or if French Marketplace sellers will be able to ship the items directly or through an Amazon partner."

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has been much deadlier in older people but more anecdotes are popping up of young, healthy people getting critically ill and even dying of the disease.
What do these cases tell us about the disease?
Two 29-year-old health care workers became seriously ill in Wuhan only one survived, a report in The New York Times detailed. Other stories about people under 50 coming down with serious symptoms are making the rounds on social media, along with questions about whether seemingly healthy young people ought to be more concerned. What do these cases tell us about the disease?
A dear friend in Madrid is in a coma with Covid-19. Hes under 40 and was in excellent condition. So much for it only killing the old and infirm. Why are NYC bars and restaurants still open?
 James B. Stewart (@JamesStewartNYT) March 15, 2020
There are reasons for people in every age group to be cautious, health experts say, but not because our understanding of who is most vulnerable to the virus is changing. Just because older people are more likely to develop a severe case or die from the disease, it doesnt mean some young people wont. That smaller number of severe cases among young people still doesnt disprove the data that shows that seniors are the most vulnerable.
The US will likely see more young people get really sick over the next several weeks simply because the pandemic is still growing. Days can pass before someone starts feeling the symptoms of COVID-19. So experts anticipate a jump in the number of cases in the US as those who have been in incubation periods start feeling ill and more people get tested for the virus.
I think its almost a math problem in some ways, right? says Benjamin Singer, an assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Even with a lower likelihood of younger people getting critically ill, a certain percentage will get critically ill, and since the denominator is growing and growing these cases are popping up more and more.
Underlying health conditions can also make younger people susceptible to a severe case of the virus. Where you find severe cases or even death in young people, we dont really have full information on these patients, says Lee Riley, chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Its possible that some of those people might have had medical conditions that we just didnt know about. Chronic conditions that can affect young people, like diabetes, can make it more difficult for someone to recover from the disease.
We cant do this without the young people cooperating.
Even younger people who feel perfectly healthy need to take the pandemic seriously because they can spread the virus even if theyre not feeling any symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. Dont get the attitude, Well, Im young, Im invulnerable. Fauci said at a press briefing today. You dont want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We cant do this without the young people cooperating. Please cooperate with us.

Electric scooters are vanishing from more cities as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to roil shared mobility services across the world. Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world, said it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries. Bird said it would halt operations in six US cities as well as all of its European markets. And Spin, which is owned by Ford, has had to pause service in very few cities and universities.
The decisions to suspend service reflect the rapidly changing environment in the US and around the world in response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Just three days ago, Lime was the only scooter company to halt operations in two US states and three European countries. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts
Now, with shelter-in-place orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home, scooter companies are likely seeing a steep drop in demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a challenge for the money-losing scooter business, that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts. The company said it was winding down or pausing service in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. 
The companys scooters remain available in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Brisbane, Australia; Busan, South Korea; Christchurch, New Zealand; Dunedin, New Zealand; Hamilton, New Zealand; Selwyn District, New Zealand; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia. 
Bird said it is pausing service in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Portland, Miami, and Coral Gables. The company has also pulled its scooters from all of its European markets, which includes Annecy, Antwerp, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Krakow, Lisbon, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, Paris, Rimini, Sevilla, Stockholm, Torino, Verona, and Vienna.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale. Given our deep understanding of and empathy towards the cities, communities and people we serve, we are temporarily pausing our service in a variety of cities, a spokesperson said. This is very fluid as the response to COVID-19 evolves and is in line with voluntary, as well as mandatory measures set by local governments for businesses.
In contrast, Spin says it has been asked to step up by some cities to help fill transportation gaps after the public bus system was shut down. The Ford-owned company says it was designated as an essential service during the citys shelter-in-place order and encouraged to continue operations as a healthy mobility option. Still, Spin said it has also paused operations in very few markets, either because a city requested it or because a university campus has been shut down. (A spokesperson didnt specify which cities it had paused service.)
For the remaining scooters still available to rent, all of the companies say they have stepped up their sanitizing efforts and instituted new workplace protocols for employees to ensure social distancing in the warehouses that are still opened. 
Lyft is still offering scooters to rent in San Francisco, but it halted operations in Miami at the request of the city. Jump, which is owned by Uber, didnt respond to requests for comment. According to Streetsblog, Jump has only paused scooter operations in Sacramento, California. Last month, Lyft said in a regulatory filing that the outbreak in China has led to production delays of certain automotive parts and components of bikes and scooters.
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic. Public transportation ridership has cratered and fare revenue has practically dried up. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also seeing precipitous drops in gross bookings in cities hit hard by the disease. Three weeks of social distancing and warnings to stay at home have taken a huge bite out of the total number of trips taken with all modes of transportation. 
But as people avoid transit and shared modes of travel, the silver lining seems to be the number of personal mobility trips that are rising. In New York City, for instance, cycling traffic on the East River bridges is up over 50 percent and Citi Bike ridership is up almost 70 percent compared to this time last year. But city officials arent doing enough to protect those riders who are switching to bikes; cyclist injuries were up 43 percent between March 9th and March 15th, according to NYPD statistics obtained by Streetsblog. 
Cities have a unique opportunity during the pandemic to remake their streets to better prioritize these low-carbon forms of transportation. While staying at home and following government recommendations for social distancing is the first order of priorities, if you have to take a trip and do not want to ride public transport, or if public transport has reduced service, the bicycle can be a good alternative, Virginia Tech transportation expert Ralph Buehler said in an email."

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs philanthropic arm, has committed $25 million to a research fund designed to help identify and develop treatments for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, it announced today.
CZI, managed by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, is donating to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which will help coordinate research efforts to identify new drugs and treatments for the illness. The Accelerator is already backed by $125 million in commitments from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, health foundation Wellcome, and Mastercards Impact Fund, according a March 10th press release.
The Gates Foundation has committed up to $50 million
CZI says it will provide $20 million to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator and make another $5 million available based on future needs. The Gates Foundation and Wellcome each have committed up to $50 million, while Mastercards Impact Fund has committed up to $25 million. 
The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, organizations in both the public and private sectors, and global regulatory and policy-setting institutions to coordinate research efforts, according to the release.
Were excited to partner with the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard to help the biomedical research community quickly identify, develop, and test treatments for COVID-19, said Chan and Zuckerberg in a statement. The Therapeutics Accelerator will enable researchers to quickly determine whether or not existing drugs have a potential benefit against COVID-19. We hope these coordinated efforts will help stop the spread of COVID-19 as well as provide shared, reusable strategies to respond to future pandemics.
CZI and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which researches ways to cure and manage diseases, have already been working to help increase the number of COVID-19 tests in the San Francisco Bay Area. CZI said last week it is aiming to help the University of California, San Francisco support at least 1,000 tests per day in the coming days.
The Gates Foundation is also working to increase testing, partnering with the University of Washington to offer at-home COVID-19 testing kits for people in the Seattle area. However, its not clear when that program will begin. The Gates Foundations commitment to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator comes in part from its up to $100 million commitment to COVID-19 response announced on February 5th.

Fact-checking organization Snopes has been forced to scale back its routine content production and special projects, as the amount of misinformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed its fact-checkers. 
In a blog post that was later published as a series of tweets, the organization said the pandemic is overwhelming its small team and that it cant ask them to ramp up productivity at a time when everyones personal lives are being placed under such strain. Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive, the organization wrote, but exhausting our staff in this crisis is not the cure for what is ailing our industry. Going forward, it said it intends to focus its efforts only where we think we can have a significant impact.
Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive
Snopes isnt the only organization struggling to handle the amount of misinformation thats being spread about the novel coronavirus pandemic. Facebook, which until last year had partnered with Snopes to combat misinformation, pledged to remove coronavirus misinformation, only for a software bug to start marking legitimate news articles as spam. Twitter, meanwhile, has been inconsistent in its approach. It removed misinformation posted by several high-profile accounts but later refused to remove a misleading tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
In its announcement, Snopes offered some advice on how people could help to combat the spread of misinformation. It directed people toward official information sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) and asked people to support local news publications and businesses. It also called for people to support Snopes directly with donations and to lobby big tech platforms to do more to combat misinformation themselves.
As well as scaling back production on its regular content, Snopes says that its offering all of its employees a $750 cash bonus to help with any costs they may be facing, and it has said it will offer paid time off for people as they look after themselves and their families.
In the meantime, if youd like to check out the COVID-19 fact-checking Snopes has already done, you can do so here."

Growing public concern over the coronavirus prompted the annual San Francisco trade show's organizers to pull the plug ahead of their March 16 start date. In a statement released Friday night, GDC organizers said that they would ""postpone"" the gathering until ""later in the summer.""
The decision came on the heels of numerous pullouts, as major companies like Microsoft, Sony, Epic Games, Facebook, and Amazon (among many others) confirmed in recent weeks that they'd be bowing out. The new coronavirus, which is formally known as COVID-19, hasn't infected huge numbers in the United States yet, but there are signs that that's changing. (The CDC already said it's ""inevitable."")
The GDC email notes that passholders who were planning to attend will be getting a separate email about ""next steps"" regarding refunds, which will be given ""in full."" Separately, some as-yet-unknown number of planned presentations from the show will be made available online for free. The organizers are also looking into getting guest speakers to submit video versions of their planned talks.
Unlike E3, the annual GDC trade show is built more around digging deep on the actual practice of making games. Talks and workshops explore the various disciplines that are tied to game development and publishing. There's also a big piece of the show that's geared around recruitment and hiring.
Even though it's more of an industry-focused event, GDC is still often a place where publishers and studios of all sizes come to reveal what they're working on. Mid-March may still bring an onslaught of such news, but it won't be against the backdrop of a bustling trade show.
SEE ALSO: Worried about coronavirus? Stop touching your face.
As of now, GDC organizers haven't said anything more specific about the timing or makeup of a possible summer version of the show. Like many things tied to this new coronavirus, a lot of those decisions will probably hinge significantly on how the illness continues to spread and whether or not the arrival of spring and the formal end of cold and flu season slows it down.
The full text of the GDC statement follows:
After close consultation with our partners in the game development industry and community around the world, weve made the difficult decision to postpone the Game Developers Conference this March.
Having spent the past year preparing for the show with our advisory boards, speakers, exhibitors, and event partners, we're genuinely upset and disappointed not to be able to host you at this time.
We want to thank all our customers and partners for their support, open discussions and encouragement. As everyone has been reminding us, great things happen when the community comes together and connects at GDC. For this reason, we fully intend to host a GDC event later in the summer. We will be working with our partners to finalize the details and will share more information about our plans in the coming weeks.

It's 2020 and yes, full grown adults still need to hear it. 
Health officials in Washington confirmed the first death from the new coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, on Saturday. The virus is highly contagious, and as of Saturday, has infected 85,641 people worldwide and is responsible for 2,933 deaths. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
As panic around the virus rises, preventative supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer are becoming increasingly difficult to buy. They're out of stock in most drugstores and big box stores like Walmart and Target. On Amazon, brands like Purell and Germ-X are only available through third party sellers at high mark-ups. Frustratedshoppers on social media warned others of the hand sanitizer shortage, crowdsourcing lists of stores that still had an inventory. 
But hand sanitizer and face masks can only do so much compared to just washing your fucking hands. 
To prevent the spread of the novel virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and washing your hands. The CDC, in fact, ""does not recommend that people who are well"" even bother with wearing face masks as protection from respiratory diseases like the coronavirus.
While sanitizing with alcohol-based gels like Purell and Germ-X can reduce the number of microbes on your hands, they're not as effective as decent hand washing. The CDC says that hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol are effective to a degree, but people don't use enough for it to make most microbes inactive. Furthermore, studiesshow that hand sanitizer isn't as effective as hand washing to make germs like C-Diff and norovirus inactive. A 2008 study concluded that hand washing reduces respiratory illnesses by 21 percent. 
And besides, you should be washing your hands regularly regardless of whether or not we're facing a potentially devastating virus outbreak. It's just good practice, no matter what the state of global health is at the moment. 
Others on Twitter echoed a similar sentiment.

 Alex (@dirtbagboyfren) February 29, 2020
Despite emphasizing effective hand washing methods since childhood, Americans are still nasty. It's estimated that 95 percent of people don't wash their hands effectively, if at all, a 2013 study from Michigan State University concluded. The study found that 7 percent of women didn't wash their hands, and of those who did, 79 percent used soap. Another 15 percent of men didn't wash their hands at all, the study found, and only 50 percent of those who did used soap. 
That is disgusting. 
Hand washing shouldn't be and really isn't that hard. Singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice and gently scrubbing under warm, soapy water takes virtually no time and can prevent major disease spread. But it shouldn't take the threat of a potential pandemic to get adults to wash their hands after touching public doors or taking a dump. That should just be a societal expectation! This shouldn't be a public service announcement in the first place! 
Stop being nasty and just wash your hands."

General Motors is partnering with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of ventilators that are needed in hospitals dealing with patients who have the novel coronavirus, the companies announced Friday. In the most severe cases of COVID-19 infection, patients need the assistance of ventilators to breathe, and there are widespread concerns that the US does not have enough ventilators to meet the coming demand.
Seattle-based Ventec is one of a handful of ventilator manufacturers in the US, according to NBC News, and already has ramped up its production. Ventec CEO Chris Kiple says the company is aiming to produce 1,000 machines per month (up from its usual 150 per month), in the next 90 days, and eventually, to produce 2,000 ventilators per month. 
Ventec will rely on GMs manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing to help build more ventilators more quickly. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that GM would continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis. 
Other automakers including Ford and Volkswagen also reportedly have contacted the White House to see how they could help with ventilator production. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla and SpaceX employees were working on ventilators and despite a tweet from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that the machines were definitely needed, Musk didnt provide further details about when or where his companies would produce the machines.

People in the US are worried about the new coronavirus outbreak. That concern is warranted: the virus is a scary new threat, it can cause serious harm, and there arent any medications that can stop it. Thats not to mention the cancellations of schools, popular events, and the general disruption to peoples lives its causing.
But fear, and the things people do when theyre afraid, changes and drives the societal impact of the virus. Viruses cant function on their own: they require a host, a person, in order to survive and reproduce. That person makes choices and behaves in certain ways. When that persons behaviors are driven by fear, it can lead to discrimination and decision-making out of line with public health recommendations which can make the outbreak even worse.
Thats the major common thread connecting outbreaks from the Black Death to the current novel coronavirus outbreak: fear and panic can magnify the harm done by a virus. People can get worked up and do bad things in response, says Philip Alcabes, professor of public health at Hunter College and author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to Avian Flu. 
In the US, panic over rising case counts has triggered a rush on grocery stores and pharmacies. In New York City, for example, theres hardly a bottle of hand sanitizer to be found, and pasta and beans are in short supply. Its good to prepare for disruption to everyday life, but theres a difference between preparedness and panic buying and the later can cause shortages. 
More troublingly, people in the US and around the world have also been buying up supplies of surgical masks and respirators, despite pleas from experts not to. Masks may offer some people comfort, but they dont provide much protection against illness if theyre not used properly (and laypeople usually dont use them properly). When theyre squirreled away in peoples homes, theyre not available for health care workers who actually need them and know how to use them. 
The World Health Organization says that there are worldwide shortages of masks and other protective equipment, and that puts health care workers at risk. Thats a problem for everyone, and it can exacerbate outbreaks. If health care workers, who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients, get sick in high numbers because they dont have proper protection, it adds to the caseload for hospitals. It also leaves fewer nurses and doctors to treat patients. 
Panic also unearths racism and discrimination. The novel coronavirus originated in China, and when it started to spread, anti-Asian racism took off around the world. The same thing happened during the SARS outbreak in 2002. Its an old story, Alcabes says. When the Black Death first came to Europe, there were rumors in Switzerland that a Jewish guy had a secret recipe for poison and was putting it in drinking wells, he says. It caused a series of really dreadful attacks on Jewish communities. The fear doesnt create prejudice; it just reveals it. It allows it to manifest. And it can do so in ways that can be really harmful to people, he says.
Also harmful are rumors and misinformation, which can spread quickly during epidemic outbreaks. They had devastating effects during the 20142015 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa: people kept sick relatives home because they were afraid of treatment centers. When they tried to care for them without proper equipment, they quickly became ill themselves. That let the disease spread among families, which made the outbreak harder to contain.
At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, false theories that the virus was a bioweapon developed by the Chinese government or by Bill Gates spread online and were repeated by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). A right-wing blog doxxed the Chinese scientist it accused of creating the weapon. In Iran, fake letters from health officials spread on social media, and bad information on the best ways to prevent infection from the virus circulated online. An email hoax led to protests in Ukraine that turned violent.
People often turn to misinformation out of fear and when they cant access or dont trust information from experts or public health officials, Rob Blair, assistant professor of political science and international and public affairs at Brown University, told The Verge. Believing misinformation can then create distrust in experts. That cycle may lead people to disregard public health advice and continue to, for example, buy and hoard masks or to ignore recommendations around isolation and quarantine. 
In the US, the spread of misinformation around the novel coronavirus has been facilitated by President Trump who has contradicted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by claiming, incorrectly, that vaccines would be available soon, that testing was widely available, and that people with symptoms of COVID-19 can go to work. The mismatch in messaging between the CDC and the president can make it hard for people to know what to trust and believe. That confusion can create and exacerbate panic.
After the Ebola outbreaks, experts wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that public health officials and authorities need to grapple with fear in their response to future outbreaks. Fear-related behaviors have the potential to accelerate the spread of a disease, they wrote.
During a disease outbreak, anxiety and worry are reasonable reactions, and its important to take precautions to reduce the spread of disease. People should wash their hands, stay home if theyre sick, and keep away from crowds; officials should consider rescheduling or canceling mass gatherings all expert-recommended and evidence-based strategies that can blunt the worst societal side effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. But striving to avoid acting out of fear and pushing public officials to communicate in ways that help limit it can help make sure those strategies have the greatest possible effect.

The cancellations include the Oculus Connect 7 virtual reality conference in San Jose, which is being replaced by an online-only event. “We will require the vast majority of our employees to work from home through at least the end of May in order to create a safer environment both for our employees doing critical jobs who must be in the office and for everyone else in our local communities,” writes Zuckerberg.

Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, April 16, 2020 Zuckerberg notes that health experts don’t know when large gatherings will be advisable again, so Facebook is preemptively canceling physical events for the next year. That covers not only Oculus Connect but probably also the company’s main F8 conference, which is typically held in the spring. To make up for the loss in revenue from Oculus Connect 7, Facebook will donate $500,000 to the city of San Jose. Much of Oculus Connect is already streamed online, but the show is also a chance for press and developers to check out prototype hardware and new games and apps. Facebook is extending its “no business travel” policy through June 2021 as well, so it’s doubtful it would even ask smaller groups to come see hardware. As for the rest, “we look forward to sharing more details about the digital event in the coming months.” One leak suggests Oculus is working on a new headset codenamed “Del Mar,” and the company could still announce news about it at the show — but with manufacturing supply chains currently in flux, it could be hitting pause on that project, too."

Verizon is canceling scheduled appointments for internet installation and repairs, according to some customers and two Verge reporters with persistent internet issues. The decision potentially leaves Fios subscribers without wired internet at a time when theyre likely relying on it for work and to see friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are minimizing our in-home installation work to critical needs to keep our employees and customers safe and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, Verizon says in a support document.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our employees and customers safe, we are making every attempt to perform work without going into homes or small businesses and are limiting in-home installs to medical emergencies and critical installations, Verizon tells The Verge in a statement. Self-install options are also available for qualified service orders, the company added.
However, Verizon actually changed the language in the support document sometime on Tuesday morning, according to Business Insider. Previously, the site said that our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services or to do repair work.
Here is the previous language, from a version of the page archived on Monday:

Qualified orders will be provided self-install options, or you may proceed with placing an order for a technician-required installation and it will be held for future appointment priority. You will receive notification to select an installation date when we resume operations.
Users on Twitter have reported that their installation appointments have been canceled. One said yesterday that his installation appointment was canceled for internet that he needed for school. In a reply, Verizon said its technicians will not be able to enter your home to install new services or do repair work.

Verizons new policies have also affected reporters here at The Verge. Science reporter Loren Grush hasnt had internet from Verizon since April 1st. A technician came to her apartment that day to investigate, but they said an engineering technician needed to look at the problem and potentially do a repair. The engineering technicians appointment was scheduled for yesterday, but they never showed up. Verizon told Grush there was a new protocol implemented on April 6th that meant technicians could no longer come into her home. 
I tried calling today but essentially was told engineering will call you, Grush said in a Slack message. We have to wait for them to call us, and since this new rule is in place, Im not entirely hopeful.
Im worried once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable.
In the meantime, Grush and her husband have been forced to rely on their mobile hotspots for internet, which they need for their work right now. She says she almost hit her mobile data cap, while her husband had to pay to add a higher data cap. Im worried [that] once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable, said Grush. 
Makena Kelly, a policy reporter at The Verge, has also been experiencing problems with her Fios internet since April 1st. A technician was scheduled to check on the problem on April 4th, but the internet returned, so Verizon canceled the appointment, she said in a Slack message. The internet went out again later that day, and Kelly hasnt been able to reschedule an appointment.
To help customers fix issues that dont need a technician to visit in person, Verizon tells The Verge that its piloting a virtual assistant tech tool that allows our field technicians to interact with customers via real time, interactive video chat. The company has not responded to questions from The Verge about how big that pilot is or when it might roll out more broadly."

Photo by Avijit Ghosh/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
The COVID-19 pandemic is on the verge of colliding with another public health threat: extreme heat, which kills more people in the US each year than any other weather-related event. Public health officials usually recommend that people without air conditioning head to places like malls and libraries where they can cool off, but thats not an option for a lot of people sheltering at home. 
The problem could soon begin to affect India
The problem could soon begin to affect India, where temperatures begin to climb in April and have reached as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Indias 1.3 billion residents have been ordered to stay indoors until April 14th to stop the spread of disease, and only about 5 percent of the population has air conditioning. 
Heat-related illness can begin with mild symptoms like a headache and muscle cramps, and they can progress to confusion, dizziness, vomiting, and losing consciousness. Once the body reaches a point where it can no longer cool itself down by sweating, heat stroke can lead to organ failure and eventually death. Those most at risk are often the poor and elderly, groups that are similarly hard-hit by the novel coronavirus. Heat-related deaths can be prevented by checking in on people who might be isolated indoors and providing public places for them to get out and cool down. But those strategies contradict efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, which mostly focus on keeping people apart.
Were in between a rock and a hard place if it were to become a heatwave during the time when were enacting physical distancing measures, says David Eisenman, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles department of community health sciences. 
Were in between a rock and a hard place
In developing countries, the migration to cities from rural areas has posed new problems when it comes to preventing deaths from heat. Traditionally built homes in less densely packed areas often included designs that naturally kept the structure cool, like inner courtyards and windows aligned to allow prevailing winds to pass through. But poorer newcomers to cities have packed into informal settlements where homes may be little more than brick or metal walls with a corrugated metal roof. Thats literally an oven, says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance, which partners with governments to plan more heat-resilient cities. Its estimated that 40 percent of the worlds urban expansion takes place in slums, and more than two-thirds of the worlds population is expected to live in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme. 
The problem is way worse in the developing world, but we shouldnt take that and say that were out of the woods here [in the US], Shickman says. The US sees upward of 600 heat-related deaths each year. Heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and more intense because of climate change, took a heavy toll in Europe last year, too, killing almost 1,500 in France last June and July. 
[Extreme heat] is even more of a pressing issue with the pandemic than it was beforehand, and this need for staying at home is only bringing out issues that already existed, says Sonal Jessel, a policy and advocacy coordinator for the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental Justice. Even though New York City has just stepped into spring, Jessel is already scrambling to figure out strategies to keep people safe in case hotter temperatures arrive earlier this year. 
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities like New York compared to surrounding areas, because all the asphalt and concrete absorb and trap heat. It can be even hotter in industrial neighborhoods with fewer trees and parks, which means some communities are more vulnerable than others. Almost half of all people who lost their lives to heat in New York City between 2000 and 2012 were African American, although theyre just under 25 percent of the citys population.
Now that were all instructed globally not to gather in close proximity, its going to really call for creativity and quick pivoting among public health systems around the world, says Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist at the National Resources Defense Council, who has worked with Jessels organization in New York and other groups in India to prevent heat-related illness and death. She and other public health experts are beginning to put their heads together to figure out how they may need to tackle two crises coming heat waves and the ongoing pandemic in tandem. But they dont have answers just yet.
Cities might have to figure out how to create publicly accessible places where people can cool down while also maintaining enough physical space between each other to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Eisenman at UCLA says. It just seems like a really hard thing to pull off, he says. 
More needs to be done to help people cool down at home
If beating the heat by going to a public place is out of the question, then more needs to be done to help people cool down at home, says Jessel. That means getting air conditioners into more homes, and helping people pay their utility bills so that they dont need to choose between running their air conditioning and paying for other necessities. With lots of people losing their jobs during the pandemic, making air conditioning affordable is even more pressing. Jessels organization is advocating for more funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that provides assistance with home energy bills. Beyond that, Jessel and other advocates are pushing for ways to retrofit homes to keep them cooler. Installing better insulation, painting roofs white to reflect the sun, and planting rooftop gardens can keep homes and buildings cool. 
Temperatures in parts of California, where theres a state-wide shelter-in-place order, are going to rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) next week. While Eisenman doesnt think those numbers will begin to pose a threat just yet, he warns that the first really hot days of the season can be particularly dangerous because people are still adjusting to the change in temperatures. And while California and New York are current hotspots for COVID-19 in the US, he worries that other states with fewer coronavirus cases now but hotter climates, like Arizona, might see their number of cases peak closer to the start of summer. That potential scenario could be deadly, which is why Eisenman and others are encouraging groups to take early measures to address the combination of threats before the case counts and temperatures start to rise.

Repair specialist iFixit is building a database filled with repair information for the worlds hospital equipment in anticipation of the increased demand caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In particular, its calling for repair manuals for ventilators and BiPAP machines that can be used as ventilators. iFixits database can be found here, and the company is calling for people to create new device pages and upload photographs and manuals.
The reasoning behind creating the database is simple: as the novel coronavirus spreads, the experience of Italian and Chinese hospitals suggests that the worlds supply of ventilators is going to be placed under huge stress, making it essential that these can be repaired quickly if and when they break down. This equipment will be an essential part of treating anyone who develops respiratory problems as a result of COVID-19.
Once its got the manuals, iFixit wants to make repair guides
There are currently few sources for repair manuals online. iFixit notes that resources like Franks Hospital Workshop exist, but these are relatively small operations. Some manufacturers provide easy access to repair manuals on their websites, but others make them harder to find.
There are a few different parts to iFixits campaign beyond assembling a collection of manuals. Once its got a manual, the company wants to format its information to make it as easy to understand as possible. It plans to break the manuals down into guides for individual repairs, to reformat them to make them more SEO-friendly, and to translate them into other languages.
iFixit also wants to put together preventive maintenance guides so technicians can work to keep their equipment in good working order before it reaches the point of breaking down.
As well as looking for people with access to repair information, iFixit is also asking for the medical community to provide information about which ventilators are currently in use as well as which parts are most likely to break. 
Its an important and timely initiative from a company thats usually associated with helping people fix their personal consumer electronics. If youve got access to any manuals that you think might be helpful for the initiative, you can upload them to iFixit directly or email the company if youve got a batch of manuals that would be too time-consuming to upload manually."

The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted departures from New York and Philadelphia airports after a trainee at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Long Island tested positive for COVID-19 today. The person had not been at the facility since March 17th, and the FAA is sanitizing affected areas. 
As of 2:45 PM ET, the agency had lifted the ground stop order, according to the Associated Press.
That center, which primarily handles high-altitude, cross-country flights, remained open. But the FAA rerouted flights as part of a longstanding contingency plan to ensure continued operations. 
The FAA said in a statement that it is working with local health officials and employee representatives to determine how many personnel might have interacted with the trainee in recent days.
CNBC reported that there have been staffing issues because of coronavirus at FAA facilities around the country; on Wednesday, flights from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas were diverted because an air traffic controller there potentially tested positive for COVID-19.
Update March 21st 2:51PM ET: Adds that the FAA lifted the ground stop order

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)Covid-19 numbers are bad and getting worse. At the time of writing, there have been over 20.5 million cases and nearly 750,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States alone there are over 5 million cases, and the pandemic has now claimed more lives than those lost in the nearly two decades of the Vietnam War. 
As I am writing this, there are throngs of people at my apartment building's pool -- no masks and no physical distancing.
This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm a 20-something myself, and during the early days of the pandemic I wrote an open letter to my generation explaining why they should be staying away from crowded beaches and staying home. I cited reliable facts and figures about the pandemic and, pointing to Italy, warned of the consequences of not taking it seriously. 
After it was picked up by CNN, my letter reached a national audience. In the face of conflicting public health advice, I hoped that highlighting the data itself would change hearts and minds. 
Five months later, it is clear that neither my piece nor the many Covid-19 public health dashboards have persuaded many of my peers. I'm struggling to understand why. 
This is not just wounded pride. Young people between 20 and 40 are a significant portion of the growing number of cases, and many more may be contagious even if they don't show any symptoms. If we want to stop the virus and re-open our schools, shops and restaurants, we need to get young people on board with masks and social distancing. 
Why aren't facts enough to do this? I don't have definitive answers. But with five months to ponder it, I have some ideas.
First, public health campaigns that promote total elimination of risk don't work well -- especially for young people. Think about abstinence-only sex education. 
It's been proven to be ineffective. But it's also associated with worse outcomes because it deprives kids of opportunities to understand how to reduce risks if they do choose to have sex. Similarly, simply bombarding young people with #StayHome memes likely won't eliminate risky behavior. 
In fact, a 30-year-old man who thought Covid-19 was a hoax recently died after attending a ""Covid party"" in Texas. Clearly, some young people are not getting good information on mitigating risk. 
We're actually in a worse position than those teaching abstinence-only sex education, because unlike the risk of STDs or teen pregnancy, the risk of Covid-19 was unknown just a few months ago. 
The pandemic has progressed with speed and -- given the mixed messaging from public officials -- chaos. It's no surprise that when we tell young people they can either stay at home or risk serious danger by leaving the house, they choose to leave the house.
Secondly, peer pressure during quarantine is enormous. I feel it daily. How can so many people be posting about their trip to the lake, dinners at fancy restaurants and ""darties"" -- daytime parties -- while I sit at home? 
Lastly, young people have always had a strong sense of invincibility. Gary L. Wenk, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Ohio State University, reports that feelings of immortality hinge on the fact that their frontal lobes are not fully developed, or myelinated. This process is completed between the ages of 25 and 30.
People see more of their mortality as they age -- young people simply aren't primed for death. And during a pandemic, that's a problem. 
So how can we apply these ideas to change behavior? 
One idea is to focus on a harm reduction model, which has successfully reduced teen pregnancies and substance abuse. Rather than an abstinence-only approach to the pandemic -- never leave the house, always wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from others -- we can recognize that some people, especially younger ones, are going to take risks whether we like it or not. 
Instead of telling them to ""STAY HOME FOREVER,"" we can help young people understand what activities are safer -- biking with a few friends, hiking, getting take-out food -- versus what are more dangerous: house parties with lots of people and swimming in crowded public pools. 
We can also try to turn peer pressure into a force for good. Studies show that peer influence can be a powerful tool in decreasing risky behavior among youth. For example, students with friends who use substances are more likely to increase their use. Conversely, after they participated in a peer-led substance abuse program, they reduced their use. 
Instead of shaming young people for following the crowd, we can encourage them to create an environment in which putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 is against the norm. Some are already doing this. Just look at these TikToks of family quarantine hijinks -- including both young and old alike -- and Instagram posts of #quarantinecooking homemade meals (yum). 
Lastly, research on invincibility shows that we can make the risks of Covid-19 real by sharing fewer statistics and long-term consequences and showing more immediate, personal stories. 
We can start with the last words the 30-year-old man who attended the ""Covid party"" reportedly told his nurse: ""I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax, but it's not."" 
The last five months notwithstanding, I continue to believe that the more people understand about Covid-19, the more lives will be saved. And I continue to hope that through reaching young people (who are often trendsetters), we will be able to also influence the wider population and not just flatten the curve but crush it."

The problem is that they've not been easily accessible in one searchable database, which means it might take callers or texters reaching out for help longer to find the resources they need. 
A new website launched Tuesday by the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition aims to change that. Its goal is to make mental health support a click away for people who are struggling with their emotional and mental wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The ability to access mental health crisis services is critical at this time, yet COVID-19 is impacting the typical ways people receive help in a crisis,"" Travis Atkinson, president of the Crisis Residential Association and co-chair of the American Association of Suicidologys Crisis Services Committee, said in a statement.  
Atkinson noted that emergency rooms, where patients might seek care for suicidal thinking and behavior or a panic attack, are focused on treating COVID-19 patients. At the same time, psychiatric hospitals are decreasing their capacity in order to follow social distancing guidelines. ""[P]eople need to know how to access available mental health services,"" Atkinson said.
The new site debuted with a database of crisis services searchable by state, contact method, support type, topics, and categories. Someone in New York, for example, could search for text-based services staffed by counselors with experience talking about anxiety. In addition to anxiety, topics include bullying, gambling, parenting, and substance use. There are several categories that focus on demographics like gender, veteran status, age, and sexuality. 
Example of a search on the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition website.

SEE ALSO: Why suicide risk may increase as we cope with COVID-19
The database includes contact information for hundreds of helplines and community centers, whose volunteers and staff are trained to connect callers with local mental health providers and resources. The site also includes articles on coping with the effects of COVID-19, tips for how to help a loved one, and information specifically for frontline workers who want mental health support. 
The Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition is a group of international mental health organizations that banded together in March in order to create the site. Its members include Crisis Text Line, the American Association of Suicidology, The Trevor Project, and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing emotional distress, you can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline by calling 1-800-985-5990 or texting TalkWithUs to 66746.

, travel and sustainability experts Sarah Kaufman
, Mark Chambers
, Dr. Lucy Mahoney, and environmental activist Ashley Renne
 joined a livestream on July 22 to discuss the future of travel and transportation post-pandemic. 
The Social Good Series is a six-month project in which issues essential to making the world a better place are covered and discussed at Mashable. July's theme was sustainability, and in addition to publishing a host of fascinating
 and helpful
 stories, Mashable hosted its first-ever livestream event (which you can watch in its entirety here).  
NEXT STORY: 
Kaufman, the associate director of the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, kicked off the livestream by pointing out there's been an interest in the implications of travel throughout the pandemic, particularly as people saw the potential
 climate benefits of reduced and modified travel. 
That attention shouldn't trickle off after social distancing measures are over: Pandemic or not, the climate crisis rages on. A focus on transportation, which Kaufman noted is a top source of emissions
, will remain absolutely crucial in the climate fight. 
Panelists discussed why we need to make sure transportation-related climate solutions also build a more equitable post-COVID world. 
""This year, 2020, is turning out to be the year for collective action. We know that our cities need to be inclusive and resilient,"" Mahoney said, adding that we need to ensure our transport systems and our streets are welcoming ""for all ages, genders, ethnicities, incomes, [and] abilities."" 
Chambers, the director of the mayor's office of sustainability in New York City, spoke about how the city, despite its well-known subway system, is ultimately a city made for cars
 and this has disastrous health impacts for people of color and low-income individuals. 
""We're designed for cars, not for people,"" Chambers said, noting that the current configuration of the city makes it so that communities of color and low-income communities are often the ones closest to roadways and thus bear the brunt of negative impacts from excessive travel. 
To emerge from the pandemic more inclusive and more sustainable, Chambers says that addressing those two issues excessive emissions from transportation and racial injustice is the core of what New York City aims to do as it builds out more sustainable transportation options throughout the city. 
""That's the big underpinning where we recognize we have to be tackling the social infrastructure simultaneously with the transportation infrastructure,"" Chambers said."

Although veteran L.A. Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke had for months vigilantly ""abandoned"" any group settings where the new coronavirus flourishes, he acknowledged recently letting his guard down. And COVID-19 hit him hard. In his first column in almost two weeks, Plaschke said he dined out with friends in a couple of lawful, socially-distanced outdoor environments where the masks inevitably came off. Plaschke thinks he got infected there. 
Though the now-recovering journalist wasn't hospitalized, Plaschke wrote his piece to share that even a healthy person without a heightened vulnerability (like older age or health conditions) can get pummeled by a disease that presently has no proven cure nor a vaccine. 
The microbial parasite is around. It's part of our lives. Experts don't expect the virus to magically disappear. And COVID-19 doesn't just bring intense physical woes.
""Nobody tells you about the dread,"" wrote Plaschke. ""From the moment my doctor phoned me with the test results, to the moment I am writing this column, I have been scared out of my mind.""
While sick, Plaschke knew fatality rates were low  though experts know the rate of death is substantially higher than the common flu
 and the virus has killed over 166,000 Americans as of Aug. 13  and that he was an otherwise healthy person. But that couldn't quell the understandable anxiety.
""It doesnt matter,"" Plaschke continued. ""Once you realize you have a virus that could kill you and theres nothing anybody can do about it, you live in constant fear.""
Fear is reasonable, considering SARS-CoV-2 is still a relatively newly emerged human pathogen. That means our population has little to no natural immunity. 
 ""It has everyone on the planet to attack,"" Dan Janies, a professor of bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who researches viruses, told Mashable in May.
We cant let up in our fight against COVID-19. 
Your mask matters. It protects you and those around you. Please wear one every time you leave your home.
 MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) August 13, 2020
So our bodies have to fight a new infection, and the course of disease can be rough, or deadly. I encourage you to read Plaschke's full, lurid account for more about a coronavirus experience that didn't require hospitalization, but was terrible, nonetheless. Here are some of his experiences:
<ul><li>""It felt like my head was on fire. One night I sweated through five shirts. I shook so much from the chills I thought I chipped a tooth. My chest felt like LeBron James was sitting on it. My fatigue made it feel as if I was dressed in the chains of Jacob Marleys ghost. I coughed so hard it felt like I broke a rib.""
</li><li>""I would fall asleep in a chair and wake up terrified from a hallucinatory dream where I was chased through a playground by old women with giant heads.""
</li><li>At night: ""You start coughing into a wet pillow and you cant stop and your breath becomes ragged and your bed is soaking and you wonder, is now the time? Do you try to drive yourself to the hospital? Do you call an ambulance? Are you just being a baby? You cant call any friends or family for help because they cant be exposed. You cant call your doctor because hes already told you theres nothing he can do.""
</li></ul>Plaschke certainly wasn't acting outwardly reckless, like attending a crowded Smash Mouth show in Sturgis, South Dakota, on Sunday. But the virus still bit. 
Wear those masks diligently, emphasize infectious disease experts. ""We are not defenseless against COVID-19, CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield said in a statement
. Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.""
The virus relies on hosts us to spread. The microbes can't survive and travel around communities without us. Many regions of the U.S. have seen surging cases this summer. It's out there. Stay vigilant.
""This is a virus that we know is very happy to take advantage of people being careless,"" Dr. Vince Silenzio, an M.D. and professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told Mashable
 in May."

The website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) usually contains a trove of publicly available data about health issues. During the coronavirus crisis, the COVID-19 data published on the site has been a crucial source for researchers and experts studying the pandemic as well as journalists tracking and publicizing the virus' spread.
The Trump administration is changing that. The website will no longer publish and make data available to the public on some key coronavirus metrics, CNN reports. 
The website edit comes thanks to a Trump administration policy change. On Tuesday, the government announced that hospitals should no longer send their daily COVID-19 reports on patients, equipment, and capacity to the CDC. Instead, hospitals are to send the data to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
The Trump administration says the change is a way of reorganizing and consolidating the data. However, unlike data sent to the CDC, what's submitted to the HHS won't be available to the public. 
The data that will no longer appear on the COVID-19 module of the website, according to CNN, is: ""current inpatient and intensive care unit bed occupancy, health care worker staffing, and personal protective equipment supply status and availability.""
Experts are alarmed by the change, saying that removing the data from public view indicates that the Trump administration may restrict and politicize health information. Throughout the pandemic, Trump's stance has been to downplay the disease that has so far killed some 138,000 Americans. Despite a current surge in cases, Trump is currently pushing to re-open schools in the fall, even though his own health experts strongly advise against it.
Typically, the CDC is more politically independent than the HHS. Indeed, the current director of the CDC has advocated strongly for a universal mask-wearing policy, while the Trump administration has equivocated on the issue. Meanwhile, the current head of HHS is seen as a Trump stalwart who has led initiatives restricting Medicaid and protecting health-care workers who decline to provide contraception on the basis of religious beliefs.

On Monday, Michael Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, tested positive for antibodies for Covid-19. While it's now been months since CES was held, he'd fallen ill shortly after coming back from the convention in January.
The report goes on to note that he wasn't the only one who felt sick shortly after attending CES. APM Reports spoke to multiple attendees who confirmed they also felt sick after the conference though they're still waiting on results for antibody tests.
Additionally, the report highlights a number of tweets in which people complained about feeling under the weather just days after the conference ended.
At the time, reports of CES-related illness didn't seem like such a big deal, though. After all, CES is known for being hectic at all hours of the day. It's also common to get sick afterwards. Every year people complain about the dreaded ""CES flu.""
People are traveling, attending back-to-back meetings during the day and events at night, walking the floors of a packed convention center, and not sleeping enough. You're also shaking hands with everyone you meet and touching devices that hordes of other people are also touching. It's almost impossible not to get sick. 
But this year, the ""CES flu"" was a little different because people appeared to be suffering from similar symptoms: fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, aches, and pains. You know, everything that comes with having Covid-19. 
Webber told the publication that his ""revelation comes at the same time that public health officials in Northern California, including Silicon Valley, reported three newly confirmed coronavirus deaths."" 
Seeing as how one of those deaths happened in early February, it means the virus might've started spreading in the United States earlier than predicted.
And, according to what's been gathered, the Vegas convention was an ""ideal environment for the virus to spread."" In addition to the United States, there are at least 63 other countries that attend CES each year. 
APM Reports also says a little more than 100 people attended this year's conference from Wuhan, China where the first outbreak was recorded towards the end of 2019. 
But CES organizers told APM Reports there haven't been any confirmed cases of Covid-19 from the conference. They also have yet to be contacted by any health, government, or corporate officials with suspicions that someone might've been exposed to the virus at the conference.
While it's a start, it'll certainly take more research to figure out if CES actually helped to spread the disease throughout the country. 
Regardless, CES is still pushing on. The Consumer Technology Association confirmed that next year's show is still scheduled as planned for January 2021. 
Whether or not anyone attends after all of this remains to be seen."

They've simply adjusted their tactics to use COVID-19 to their advantage.
Apple has just released iOS 13.5, and with it unlocked access to the contact-tracing system it co-developed with Google. However, Colleen Tressler, Consumer Education Specialist at the FTC, is warning that scammers are now using contact tracing as a cover for targeting consumers via their mobile devices.
Getting in touch with people who have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 is usually initiated via a text message. But in a post on the FTC website, Tressler warns, ""scammers, pretending to be contact tracers and taking advantage of how the process works, are also sending text messages. But theirs are spam text messages that ask you to click a link.""
Sure enough, if you don't spot the scam and click the link you're likely taking the first step towards having unwanted software installed on your device. After that, your personal and financial details are vulnerable to being stolen. With that in mind, the FTC is telling everyone to ""Don't take the bait,"" remain vigilante, and take action to protect themselves. That means filtering out text messages from unknown senders if you can, enabling two-factor authentication on all online accounts that offer the feature, and always installing the latest available updates for your device(s).

Unveiled on Wednesday, the Fitbit Flow is an ""easy-to-use, and low-cost"" emergency ventilator designed in consultation with healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients. Based on manual resuscitator bags used by paramedics, the ventilator features various sensors to help monitor patients, and allows the pressure and volume of oxygen delivery to be controlled. The Fitbit Flow also has a clear window through which healthcare workers can view the automated resuscitator bag being pumped.
It isn't a long-term solution conventional ventilators are still sorely needed. Instead, the Fitbit Flow is intended to act as a temporary stopgap keeping patients alive until they can be put on a standard machine.
""We know from some conversations that physicians are already trying to work out the ethics in deciding who gets the ventilator and who doesnt, due to shortage of supply,"" said Dr. Tony Faranesh, a Fitbit research scientist who helped develop the ventilator. ""The goal here is to support life in the event that ones not available until one might become available.""
The FDA has already authorised the Fitbit Flow for emergency use during the pandemic where conventional ventilators aren't available. 
The Fitbit Flow has a modular stand, enabling it to be used with O2 tanks of various sizes.

Fitbit has stated it intends to use its existing infrastructure to quickly manufacture ""large volumes"" of these devices. The company has no plans to continue manufacturing ventilators after the current health crisis passes though this is only a temporary shift in focus.
""COVID-19 has challenged all of us to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity, and use everything at our disposal to more rapidly develop products that support patients and the healthcare systems caring for them,"" said Fitbit CEO James Park.
""We saw an opportunity to rally our expertise in advanced sensor development, manufacturing, and our global supply chain to address the critical and ongoing need for emergency ventilators and help make a difference in the fight against this global virus.""

Though governments around the world are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions, the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing. As of Wednesday, the World Health Organisation reports approximately 6.3 million confirmed cases globally, including 380,000 deaths. The U.S. continues to account for the largest proportion of these numbers, with around 1.8 million cases and 105,000 deaths, and thousands more continue to be diagnosed daily."

Southeast Asia’s foreign ministers have joined hands with China and declared their intention to “stay strong!”
Yet their hastily called meeting in secretive, socialist Laos last week suggests not so much resiliency as the need to shore up mutual support. Health experts are widely skeptical of the numbers reported by China’s neighbors, and believe the deadly infection is spreading undetected throughout much of Southeast Asia.
With infection clusters increasingly sprouting outside the mainland, where the virus originated, many fear these pockets—rooted out or not—are sustaining the outbreak and pushing the world toward a global pandemic.
The disease, officially COVID-19, has sickened over 83,000 and killed more than 2,850, primarily in China. But cases have spread to more than four dozen countries, and been identified as far away as Brazil and Finland.
Strangely absent from the list are Myanmar and Laos, which border China, as well as Brunei, East Timor, and Indonesia—of which the latter had daily, direct flights to the virus epicenter, Wuhan. Every other country in the region, all beneficiaries of Chinese aid, investment and tourism, has reported cases.
“The transmission dynamics of this virus are like the flu. It’s very, very difficult to stop,” says Richard Coker, a Bangkok-based professor emeritus of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
At the beginning of the outbreak, several of these governments downplayed the severity of the threat, publicly voicing their wariness of offending the superpower upon whom their economies rely. In lieu of public health precautions or stringent defenses, they offered folk remedies—suggesting everything from consuming onions or alcohol to working less to ward off coronavirus.
“Surely the desire not to alienate China was a factor,” says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Overall, the region is just so heavily tied to China now.”
In Cambodia, which has increasingly gravitated into China’s orbit, Prime Minister Hun Sen insists he won’t cut air travel, beyond suspending the six weekly flights from Wuhan. He also refuses to evacuate citizens stranded in Wuhan, as other countries have done. While Beijing chided the U.S. for banning Chinese travelers, saying it “set a bad example,” Hun Sen earned plaudits when he flew to China earlier this month.
“A friend in need is a friend indeed,” he wrote on his official Facebook page.
But Hun Sen’s vehement denial of the disease’s risks has stoked fears that Cambodia, a tourism hotspot with limited health resources, will become yet another vector of transmission.
“The cost of his decision is the health of his people,” says Sophal Ear, an expert on Cambodian politics at Occidental College in California. “Cambodia has become the weakest link: a country with poor health care, poor disease surveillance, and a long rap sheet of non-reporting.”

Earlier this month, a study by five researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that it is statistically implausible that Cambodia and Thailand do not have more cases, and virtually impossible that Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has not reported a single one. Based on its direct flights from Wuhan, the archipelago should have at least five patients by now, the study found.
It’s not that these countries are getting lucky, says Marc Lipsitch, director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, and one of the study’s authors. “They’re missing infections.”
About 2 million Chinese tourists visit Indonesia annually, mostly holidaying in Bali. According to China’s consulate there, 5,000 Chinese tourists, 200 from Wuhan, were visiting the resort island when news of the outbreak suspended flights on Feb. 5. Most werenot quarantinedor tested.
“There are definitely cases. We just haven’t found them yet,” says Dr. Shela Putri Sundawa, an Indonesian physician who hosts health podcast “Relatif Perspective.”
“I think the surveillance we’re doing now is too loose.”
Doctors in Indonesia are not testing all respiratory infections for coronavirus, relying instead on weeding out suspected patients by their links to known cases or their travel history, she says.
But cases have already turned up in several countries among those who have not been to China. Missing one potential carrier can lead to further infections that can’t be linked to travel, meaning more and more patients who might never be screened.
“You can’t find things you don’t look for,” says Lipsitch, the Harvard epidemiologist. “We estimated that even high surveillance countries were missing about half their imported cases.”
He predicts that a global coronavirus pandemic is “likely” and that 40 to 70 percent of the world’s population could be infected (though they won’t all become sick).
‘So what can we investigate?’
In Indonesia, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, security minister Mohammad Mahfud MD has told reporters “the coronavirus does not exist” in the country.
Indonesia’s health officials insist their protocols follow the World Health Organization’s guidelines with a system focusing on temperature checks at arrival gates and self-reporting. Most of Southeast Asia follows this approach, even as several studies indicate border screenings are not effective.
“I think airport scanning is more of a political measure than a practical measure. It might calm people down and demonstrate that the government is doing something, but as for public health, it’s not very useful,” says Coker, the emeritus public health professor.
These screenings must catch people in a very narrow window, between when they are well enough to travel, but sick enough to detect. Temperature scanners, fickle at the best of times, will also not find anyone whose fever may have subsided after a Tylenol on the plane. And just because someone doesn’t present clinical symptoms, doesn’t mean they aren’t sick. Asymptomatic patients still in the incubation phase have shed this coronavirus, according to doctors.
Two tourists who traveled through Indonesia before later testing positive have prompted alarm. A Chinese visitor who traveled to Bali from Wuhan was reportedly confirmed to have the virus on Feb. 4, after he left, while a man from Tokyo was hospitalized with the infection soon after returning to Japan on Feb. 19.
Indonesia’s health directorate general secretary, Achmad Yurianto, told local media he did not know the Japanese man’s name or where he visited. “So what can we investigate?”
The government also said that none of the 243 people who were evacuated from Wuhan on Feb. 2 showed signs of the virus while quarantined at a military hospital on an island northwest of Borneo.
But Dr. Putri Sundawa noted that the standard quarantine lasts 14 days, while the disease incubation period can stretch potentially as long as 24 days.
“If there were no complaints of pneumonia, they would not be checked,” she says.

Relying on self-reporting once cases are introduced to the country creates further problems if patients and medical workers don’t know what to look for. An Indonesian woman with viral pneumonia was reportedly discharged because she had not been to China, while a nurse who cared for her had “no idea” the case could have been a coronavirus suspect.
It’s also hard to test for coronavirus without the right lab kits, which Indonesia lacked until February 5. The country’s health minister, a former military doctor who previously stoked controversy for urging a “brainwashing” treatment on stroke victims, determined that prayer had kept the virus away. His message to the public: “don’t be anxious.”
Myanmar, like Indonesia, has not reported a single case of coronavirus as of Friday. The restive country shares a 1,400-mile, porous border with China over which goods and people continue to flow.
Until donated testing kits arrived on Feb. 20, no domestic hospitals were able to confirm coronavirus cases. Previously, samples had to be shipped to Thailand or Hong Kong with results taking up to one week.
In a country with limited political freedoms and a kneejerk reaction to negative press, the government has kept a tight lid on coronavirus. Even government spokespeople said they did not have permission to comment on what preparations were being taken for an outbreak. Rather than empower the spread of information, the Health Ministry has reportedly proposed amending legislation to punish any healthcare workers who talk to the press or public about the virus with up to six months in jail or a $70 fine.
‘Extreme risk’
“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said earlier this month.
With the exception of small and affluent Singapore, which experts have praised for its response to coronavirus, Southeast Asian governments spend little on health per capita by international standards. Even Indonesia, with a population of nearly 270 million spread over thousands of islands, faces discrepancies in health resources and suffers an overall shortage of facilities and personnel.
While admitting they may struggle amid an outbreak, Indonesian health officials insist they will contain the virus before it becomes one. But many health experts say it’s too late, as coronavirus will ultimately evade containment.
Coker, in Bangkok, says all countries should be preparing for a pandemic and implementing mitigation measures, like closing schools, preparing hospitals and redistributing medical staff as needed. Southeast Asian countries, he says, should assume they have cases.
The U.K.’s National Health Services has already seemingly made the leap. Anyone returning from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos with symptoms, however mild, is advised to call the NHS hotline. Global risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft warns of “extreme risk” in Indonesia and Cambodia based on those countries’ ability to respond to a pandemic.
Yet even amid concerns about regional preparedness and possible equipment shortages, several Southeast Asian nations have been rushing to donate goggles, face masks and respirators to China. Laos, with a GDP comparable to Mali’s and Afghanistan’s, mustered $400,000 and $100,000-worth of supplies for the world’s second-largest economy after a national fundraising campaign.
Such political genuflection may have broad consequences. How nations across the world cope with coronavirus, and what they choose to prioritize, could resonate globally. And because of cross-border travel, migration and international tourism, Southeast Asia is highly interconnected with the rest of the world.
As countries everywhere grapple with or brace for coronavirus, the possibility of undetected cases spreading throughout the region underscores how the virus can no longer be assumed to stay confined to a handful of outbreak clusters.
“The significance of not recognizing the true breadth of the outbreak is that it continues to suggest to some that the travel bans and quarantines are effective tools in limiting global spread,” says virologist Christopher Mores at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.
“The sooner this outbreak is appreciated for the pandemic it has become, the better for a coordinated global response.”

The study, done by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the overall chances of dying from COVID-19 — the disease caused by the virus — are 2.3%. Other estimates suggest the fatality rate could be higher: around 4.3%. The current rate, based on the ratio of reported deaths to total cases worldwide, hovers around 3.4%.
But the Chinese CDC study found that the fatality rate rate rose to 8% for patients in their 70s and 15% among those in their 80s.Out of more than 44,000 coronavirus patients studied, the majority of deaths were among those at least 60 or older.
Older patients are also more likely to have preexisting health problems. The first patient to die of the coronavirus in the US, for instance, was a man in his 50s who had been chronically ill before getting infected.
Nearly 5,300 patients in the Chinese study reported a health condition not related to the virus, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Around 7% of those cases — more than 370 patients — died. Overall, patients with preexisting conditions represented more than a third of all deaths reported in the study. The fatality rate for patients who reported no underlying health problem was less than 1%. 
Here's the mortality rate for each preexisting condition reported in the study:
Ruobing Su/Business Insider
The authors were missing the health history of more than 20,000 patients in their study, but their research is still provides one of the broadest pictures so far of how COVID-19 operates in humans.
Among coronavirus patients, the preexisting condition that raises risk most appears to be heart disease. Patients already diagnosed with heart disease had a fatality rate of more than 10%. Diabetes was the preexisting condition with the second-highest fatality rate: 7%. 
Patients with the most commonly reported preexisting condition, hypertension (high blood pressure), had a fatality rate of 6%. Coronavirus patients with cancer had a similar fatality rate. 
In total, COVID-19 has killed nearly 3,000 people and infected around 86,000. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, central China's most populous city, and has since spread to at least 58 other countries. More than 90% of cases are on the Chinese mainland.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said two more Americans tested positive for the virus out of the group of quarantined passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington state worried about the virus spreading through West Coast communities after confirming three patients were infected by unknown means.
The World Health Organization upgraded the risk level from the virus to “very high” as it continued to spread around the globe. Friday evening, the State Department issued an advisory telling Americans to avoid nonessential travel to Italy, which has seen nearly 900 cases. A travel advisory already is in place for China.
Two days after the White House abruptly shifted gears from President Donald Trump’s initial assurances of minimal U.S. fallout to an all-out mobilization under Vice President Mike Pence, the administration’s messaging still wasn’t completely seamless.
Trump administration political appointees and nonpartisan career government scientists both agree that the current risk to Americans is low, although that could quickly change. But some political officials are continuing to offer assurances that concerns will blow over soon, while the scientists are emphasizing preparations for circumstances as yet unknown.
“I acknowledge that this could change. I acknowledge the situation could deteriorate. I acknowledge the risks,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday. “But, given what we know … looks to me like the market has gone too far.”
Financial markets continued to slide, with the Dow Jones average suffering its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.
Later in the day Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank would cut interest rates to support the economy if needed. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers of both parties are working on a spending bill to be unveiled early next week and expected to be two to three times more than the $2.5 billion the White House had requested for anti-virus efforts.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called attention to the breadth of options under consideration, telling reporters the administration may invoke the 1950 Defense Production Act to ensure production of needed supplies for anti-virus effort. For example, the government says it needs 300 million masks for health care workers, but only has 30 million stockpiled.
“We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary,” said Azar. “So that is the authority that we have and we intend to use to acquire anything we need to acquire.” However, he added the government wants to avoid disruptions.
Shortly before the new California case was announced, Trump told reporters, “We’re at the same number.”
“We haven’t lost anybody yet and hopefully we can keep that intact,” he said as he left the White House for a political rally in South Carolina.
Trump said he’s still considering denying entry to people from countries affected by coronavirus. “We’re looking at that right now,” he said. “And we’re looking at a couple of countries, a few countries that have little bit disproportionately high number, and we’re going to make that decision very soon.”
For the CDC’s disease detectives, the priority now is setting up a nationwide testing infrastructure after a shaky start. Dr. Nancy Messonier, the CDC’s chief of respiratory diseases, told reporters the goal is to have every state capable of testing for the virus by the end of next week.
A three-step test kit from CDC is being replaced with a two-step process that Messonnier said should work better.
“Our goal is to have every state and local health department doing its own testing by the end of next week,” said Messonnier. That’s a considered a critical step, because it would push the front lines of surveillance closer to local communities where new cases might present themselves.
Disease detectives are still tracing the contacts of a Northern California woman who may be the first person in the U.S. to get sick without having traveled to China or having been in close contact with a returning traveler.
“We need to remember right now that the case count in the U.S. is really low,” said Messonnier. “That is a reflection of the aggressive containment efforts of the U.S. government. We hope that if there is spread, the spread will be limited and that any disease in the United States will be mild.”
The global virus outbreak has become a test of Trump’s credibility and his administration’s capacity to protect the nation. Public health experts say the president should let the scientists in government take the lead.
“The White House functions best when it follows the leadership of experts in emergency response,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonprofit Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve public health.
Although the president himself is famously skeptical of science, the White House is now trying to surround itself with top-flight scientific expertise. Friday, officials announced the White House and the National Academy of Sciences have established a committee of experts on infectious diseases to help on the coronavirus threat.
“We are creating a direct line to the nation’s top scientific minds on public health,” said Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Next week, Congress is expected to expedite a bipartisan spending bill for the anti-virus campaign that could total between $6 billion and $8 billion.
The administration says it has enough funding to get through to April but that Congress should act as quickly as possible to approve additional funding. The White House wants Trump to sign the spending bill it by mid-March.
As other countries hard hit by coronavirus cancel public activities and shutter schools, HHS Secretary Azar said such measures could be part of the containment toolkit here, if needed.
Keeping kids home from school and running workplaces on a skeleton staff is part of what experts call “social distancing,” a way to keep people from passing disease to one another. As recently as 2009, a flu pandemic led to school closures in many U.S. communities.
“It can be indicated under certain circumstances that it might make sense to close a school or schools, or take other measures like that,” said Azar. In the U.S. that would be a decision made at the local level.
“What we’re all trying to do is just be very transparent … with the public to get our mental frame around that there are things that you might see,” said Azar. “That doesn’t mean you will see (them).”

Vice President Mike Pence announced the new restrictions and warnings as President Donald Trump said 22 people in the U.S. have been stricken by the new coronavirus, including four deemed “very ill” and that additional cases are “likely.” Trump added that he was considering additional restrictions, including closing the U.S. border with Mexico in response to the virus’ spread.
“We’re thinking about all borders,” Trump said.
Trump provided an update on the virus from the White House press briefing room for the second time this week after the first reported U.S. death Saturday, of a woman he described as being in her late 50s and having a high medical risk. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was “no evidence of link to travel” in the case of the woman who died.
On Friday, health officials confirmed a second case of coronavirus in the U.S. in a person who didn’t travel internationally or have close contact with anyone who had the virus. The U.S. has a total of about 60 confirmed cases. Trump’s tally appeared to exclude cases of Americans repatriated from two cruise ships in Asia.
Trump said healthy Americans should be able to recover if they contract the new virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets spooked by the virus threat.
He encouraged Americans not to alter their daily routines, saying the country is “super prepared” for a wider outbreak, adding “there’s no reason to panic at all.”
He added he wasn’t altering his routine either. “You’re talking about 22 people right now in this whole very vast country. I think we’ll be in very good shape.”
Trump spoke a day after he denounced criticism of his response to the threat as a “hoax” cooked up by his political enemies. Speaking at a rally in South Carolina he accused Democrats of “politicizing” the coronavirus threat and boasted about preventive steps he’s ordered in an attempt to keep the virus that originated in China from spreading across the United States. Those steps include barring entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China.
“They tried the impeachment hoax. … This is their new hoax,” Trump said of Democratic denunciations of his administration’s coronavirus response.
Trump said Saturday he was not trying to minimize the threat of the virus.
“Again, the hoax was used in respect to Democrats and what they were saying,” he said.
Some Democrats have said Trump could have acted sooner to bolster the U.S. response to the virus. Democratic and Republican lawmakers also have said his request for an additional $2.5 billion to defend against the virus isn’t enough. They’ve signaled they will provide substantially more funding.
Trump said Democrats want him to fail and argued that steps he’s taken so far have kept cases to a minimum and prevented virus deaths in the U.S.
As global markets plunged this week, Trump predicted they will come back, and encouraged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
“The markets will all come back,” he said. “I think the Fed has a very important role, especially psychological. If you look at it, the Fed has a massive impact.”

In video shared by NBC News 4 San Antonio, Appleby can be seen explaining what COVID-19 cases have been like across her city, and recalling a tragic tale of a coronavirus patient's last words to a nurse.
""I heard a heartbreaking story this week. We cared for a 30-year-old patient at Methodist Hospital who told their nurse that they attended a 'COVID party,'"" Appleby says. ""This is a party held by somebody diagnosed with the COVID virus, and the thought is that people get together to see if the virus is real and if anyone gets infected.""
""Just before the patient died, they looked at their nurse and they said, 'I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax but it's not,'"" Appleby continues. ""This is just one example of a potentially avoidable death of a young member of our community, and I can't imagine the loss of the family.""
Though there's been a great deal of skepticism surrounding the idea of intentional COVID parties, if you attend a gathering with a large number of people and don't take accurate safety precautions, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and sanitizing your hands, you're undoubtedly putting yourself at greater risk of contracting the virus.
In the video above, which is featured in the NBC News 4 San Antonio article, Appleby explains that lately, San Antonio has been seeing the coronavirus ""affect a broader age range of people, including young people in their 20s and 30s.""
""In Methodist Hospital today we have several 20-year-olds and several 30-year-olds that are critically ill,"" she says. ""Some of these younger folks come to the hospital for treatment and can be discharged home, yet others become ill very quickly and require intensive care.""

While Appleby notes that she doesn't want to be seen as ""an alarmist,"" she hopes that sharing these heartbreaking ""real-world examples"" will help people realize that they need to take this virus more seriously.
""We care deeply about the citizens of San Antonio, Texas, and we are here to help you. At the same time, we hope that you don't need our help,"" Appleby says. ""Please wear a mask, stay at home when you can, avoid groups of people, and sanitize your hands.""
Appleby also stresses that you should not feel as though you are in any way immune to COVID-19.

Follow her @DrJenLee. Opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. 
 (CNN)On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that it would wind down the White House coronavirus task force. Confirming this to CNN, a senior White House official said the task force ""will be phased down around Memorial Day.""
This came as a shock, as the University of Washington's model, which the White House seemed to trust, predicted deaths in the US to be almost twice as high as it previously estimated, with the daily toll rising to nearly 3000 by the beginning of June. 
Luckily, President Donald Trump seemed to change course on Wednesday, tweeting that ""the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.""
This tweet is a huge relief to those of us who appreciate the benefit of having a task force in times of crisis. Disbanding it would have been a dangerous move that would have made it even harder to contain this virus in the weeks and months to come. 
Here's why the task force is vital: 
We are battling fatigue and complacency 
Though we are far from being out of the woods, we are already battling fatigue and increasing complacency when it comes to the virus. State and local leaders are under extreme pressure to reopen their communities and some have made concessions to relax restrictions whether they meet the criteria suggested by the White House or not. 
When the White House coronavirus task force let the national social distancing guidelines expire on April 30, and provided only the less stringent state guidance for reopening, it sent an implied message that the situation has improved enough that there is no need for further federal direction and the rest is up to the states. 
Winding down the task force would have entirely reinforced this message and left state leaders with even less top cover. It would have also signaled that the virus is no longer a top priority, which could have made it harder for some state leaders to emphasize that the virus is a very real and ongoing threat.
Coordination and decision-making are crucial right now
Effective coordination and communication between federal agencies -- and between federal and state agencies -- has been an ongoing challenge throughout this crisis. 
This is not a new phenomenon. Having served in leadership positions in both federal and state government, I can attest to how difficult it is to achieve seamless cooperation among the most competent and well intended public servants even in the best of times. Often, agencies will have different ideas about how to solve a problem -- and someone at a higher level needs to make a decision quickly about how to move forward. 
That's why in the event of an emergency or crisis it often takes the formation of a task force or similar command structure to bring together disparate agencies to share information, clarify roles, and work together towards a common purpose. In the absence of this, agencies tend to quickly default to working in siloes. One of the reasons testing has been such a difficult nut to crack is because it is so dependent on collaboration and coordination between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state and local governments, and the private sector. Dissolving the task force would have made this even harder.
Covid-19 spreads at a frightening speed
The speed of viral spread is one aspect that makes Covid-19 difficult to contain. On March 5th, there were 12 deaths due to Covid-19 in the US. Nine weeks later, there have now been over 71,000 deaths.
At every point along the way, the virus has moved faster than our ability to contain it. Speed and agility are not often strengths of government agencies. Concerns over shortages of resources, like the protective personal equipment needed by medical personnel, were not taken seriously enough by leaders who could have prioritized acquiring the necessary supplies.
As anyone who has worked in government knows, there is a chain of command. Important decisions often must be approved by agency leaders or the White House. These processes are typically slow and it is all too easy for key insights or pieces of information to get lost along the way, even unintentionally. That's why a task force structure that allows for subject matter experts to come together, share information and brief political leaders is most efficient way to inform decision making during a time of crisis. 
The crucial importance of how we observe Memorial Day
As more states loosen restrictions, we may be entering an even more dangerous phase of this pandemic, potentially setting ourselves up for serious outbreaks across the country.
Hokkaido, Japan, provides a perfect example of what can happen if lockdowns are lifted too early. According to TIME, in late February, the island had the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all prefectures in Japan. 
On February 28, the governor declared a state of emergency, closed schools and encouraged people to stay at home.
Many restaurants and businesses also closed. By mid-March, the situation had turned the corner; the health crisis largely stabilized and pressure from businesses to reopen began to grow. In response, on March 19, the governor of Hokkaido lifted the state of emergency but asked residents to continue social distancing and stay home if they felt sick.
Unfortunately, the announcement came just before a three-day weekend, when many residents ventured out to celebrate the lifting of the restrictions. As TIME reported, Dr. Kiyoshi Nagase, chairman of the Hokkaido Medical Association, believes this likely started a second wave of infections in Hokkaido. On April 14, 26 days later, the governor announced a second state of emergency and reimposed restrictions. 
The upcoming Memorial Day weekend in the US is not only a national holiday to honor those who have died in military service, but it is also the start of the summer season. Many Americans will be planning travel and recreational activities for that weekend which could lead to further spread of the virus. By then, some states will also have relaxed restrictions for weeks, enough time for an outbreak to have surfaced, assuming that testing is in place to detect one fast enough.
It is entirely possible that the continuation of the task force will lead to new national guidelines for protective measures as the summer starts. We can only hope that this is the case, otherwise we may find ourselves facing a second wave of the pandemic -- and countless more deaths to come."

Ulster County health officials are searching for anyone who may have had their haircut at the barbershop over the last three weeks, a statement from the county says. Kingston is located roughly 90 miles north of New York City.
""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease and learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening,"" said Dr. Carol Smith, the health commissioner for Ulster County, in a statement.
County health officials are recommending anyone who received a haircut at the shop on Broadway during the past three weeks to get tested for the coronavirus. 
""This kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" Smith said.
There are currently 1,563 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ulster County and 64 fatalities, according to the county. People who came in contact with the Kingston barbershop should contact the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health.
According to directives from state Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons or other personal hygiene services had to remain closed.
Speaking about this particular case on Thursday, Cuomo said hairstyling is by definition an up-close and personal occupation and so it would be part of phase two of reopening. 
NYC contact tracing efforts
Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says hundreds of people have been trained to begin contact tracing and will start work in the coming days.
New York City will have 1,000 contact tracers by the end of the month, and by the beginning of June they plan to get up to 2,500 trained individuals, according to de Blasio. It would then build as needed to potentially go up to as many as 10,000 tracers.
The effort is being led by NYC Health and Hospitals. The contact tracers will investigate cases, trace and monitor contacts, and manage all case data and inquiries. This would allow the city to immediately isolate and care for those who test positive for the virus, and then rapidly track, assess, and quarantine anyone they came into contact with who they may have infected, according to a NYC Health and Hospitals press release.
The effort is ""bigger, more complex and a much greater operational challenge than anything we've seen in the history of contact tracing in this city,"" the mayor said. The Department of Health and their expertise are being brought in for ""maximum impact,"" he added.

 (CNN)The concern was that Covid-19 would overwhelm the medical care system with patients. While that has happened in some hot spots, the broader picture is just the opposite: Covid-19 has deprived the system of patients. 
Some of these would-be patients have surely been hurt: having either shied away or been told to stay away from interventions that would have helped them live longer and/or live better. For others the delay may not matter; they will do equally well with intervention at a later date. But it is important to consider another possible outcome: some do better with less medical care. 
No one has national data yet, but the turn of events is remarkable. 
In mid-March hospitals began to cancel elective surgeries both to protect patients and to provide surge capacity, following guidance from the American College of Surgeons. This not only halted hernia repairs and joint replacements, but also surgeries for low-risk cancers -- specifically, early stage breast and prostate cancer.
Next, emergency care unexpectedly plummeted. Emergency rooms in Boston, Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul saw substantial drops in volume, and ER doctors are experiencing cuts to both their hours and pay. The decline in volume doesn't appear to be confined to fewer minor injuries and self-limited illnesses, it also includes fewer heart attacks and strokes.
But the impact of Covid-19 goes well beyond the hospital to include all physician/patient encounters. Despite the advent of telehealth, primary care practices are seeing fewer patients and laying off staff. The American Academy of Family Physicians estimates that about 40% of family medicine clinics are at risk of closing by the end of June -- more than doubling the number of US counties with a significant shortfall in health care providers at the end of March. 
Given fewer outpatient visits, one downstream effect is wholly expected: fewer lab tests and X-rays. This limits efforts to find disease early in asymptomatic individuals. Most notably, cancer screening has been effectively shut down.
What can we learn from this cataclysmic disruption in medical intervention? 
Previous research on the global effects of doctor strikes suggests that overall mortality either remains stable -- or, in fact, declines. Clearly, it will be important to carefully study 2020 mortality trends and disentangle Covid-related deaths from other causes of death. It will be equally important to distinguish the well-off from the poor: we may find that medical care disruption decreases mortality among the well-off, yet increases mortality among the poor.
While analysis of overall mortality is important, so, too, is looking into more granular topics. The disruption in elective surgeries should lead us to reevaluate the necessity of those surgeries and their associated risks. There are opportunities to look at still finer detail: In our hospitals (Brigham and OHSU), for example,women with early-stage breast cancer are having their surgeries delayed and are instead being started on hormonal therapy. Maybe we will learn that some women don't need surgery.
Suspending cancer screening is another important area to study. There is little doubt, for example, that the decline in mammography will lead to fewer breast cancers diagnosed. But is that a bad thing or good thing? 
One opportunity is to study what happens to US cancer statistics when screening is resumed. One of two observations are possible. Rates of breast cancer might catch up: meaning the deficit in cancers during the pandemic would be matched by a surplus of cancers in subsequent years. In other words, all the cancers that sat undetected in patients during the pandemic would be eventually found. The alternative would be that breast cancer diagnoses never catch up. 
Years ago, researchers observed this phenomenon in Norway. Women, ages 50-64, who underwent three mammograms over six years had more invasive breast cancers found compared to similar women who had a single mammogram at the end of six years. Delayed mammography led to less breast cancer diagnoses and the deficit never caught up -- despite a mammogram at the end of six years. These findings suggest that some small cancers regress on their own. Might this be happening right now during the Covid-19 pandemic?
The decline in heart attack and strokes raises equally important questions in cardiovascular disease. Some patients may have been reluctant to come to the hospital and suffered, perhaps even died, at home. However, what ""counts"" as a heart attack or stroke has expanded over the years. An alternative explanation may be that doctors are no longer diagnosing patients with very mild cardiac or neurologic abnormalities. Perhaps what is being missed are painless, minor events for which treatment is unneeded -- or even harmful. 
It's also possible that there are genuinely fewer heart attacks and strokes occurring right now. Smog is disappearing in Los Angeles and, in India, people can see the Himalayas from miles away for the first time in 30 years. Air pollution has been consistently linked to heart attacks. And ""hunkering down"" has meant slowing down for many. Has better air and lifestyle helped our hearts?
After Covid-19, if we dare imagine the day, it will be important to ask who was harmed by delayed and forgone medical care. But the severe financial strains on individuals and public budgets make it just as essential to ask who benefited from avoiding interventions with no salutatory effect. 
But we won't find the benefits unless we look for them. We need physician researchers willing to ask hard questions about services they deliver -- questions that may threaten their own professional/financial self-interests. 
Covid-19 provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to study what happens when the well-oiled machine of medical care downshifts from high to low volume in order to focus on acutely ill patients. It will be comfortable for physician researchers to study what was lost. It will be courageous for them to study what was gained."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. 
 (CNN)An interesting moment in Fox News reporter Chris Wallace's memorable interview of President Donald was a confusing back and forth about Covid-19 related deaths. The President claimed that the US had the ""number one low mortality rate"" in the world -- whereas Wallace insisted the US had little to crow about.
Though it is clear that Trump is completely wrong, comparing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mortality of each affected country turns out be a very tricky business. Because no one metric is perfect, especially when used to compare impact across countries, there is a large corner of epidemiology dedicated to how to most accurately tabulate death. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) devotes a long entry to addressing which is the best metric for a given situation in its online course, ""Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice."" 
As Covid-19 reporting has evolved, the death count has been the most cited number to track the size of the tragedy in the US and other countries. According to John Hopkins University, more than 148,000 human lives in the US have been lost because of this disease. 
Much time could and should be spent on understanding the death count, especially since a growing proportion of the US -- now 31% -- thinks the count is an overestimate. In contrast, most public health experts feel strongly that this is an underestimate. 
The simple death count is not used in comparisons to other countries, due to vast differences in country population sizes. To account for this variation, most public health experts prefer to use rates, not counts. 
The two most popular rate measures are the case fatality ratio (CFR) and the rate per total population (those with and without the disease) called the mortality rate. The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which Chris Wallace and Fox News cited during the President's interview, offers users an easy toggle between the two measures. 
The CFR measures the number of deaths divided by the number of people diagnosed with the disease. The advantage of this metric is that it is intuitive and is exactly what an individual person with Covid-19 wants to know -- given the diagnosis, what is the likelihood I will die? The disadvantage is substantial because CFR can change depending on how much of a population is tested for a disease. 
As an example, think of a country with 100 people where four people are hospitalized with Covid-19 and six others are diagnosed but are well enough to stay home. If no contact tracing or community tracing is done, only 10 people are known to have the infection. Three of these 10 people die, yielding a CFR of 30%.
Now consider if the same country with that population of the 10 infected people above performed contact tracing and community testing and diagnosed 10 additional persons with no or mild symptoms. As with the first example, three people die. But here the CFR is 15% (three deaths in 20 known cases). In other words, a higher testing rate leads to a lower CFR -- a point that might make a testing fan out of the President.
To circumvent the large problem introduced by diagnostic test volume, the mortality rate, in contrast, uses total population (those with the disease -- diagnosed or not -- AND those without the disease). Everyone. Period. 
This metric has little value to a patient who wants to know his prognosis but measures exactly what public health authorities need to know -- how bad is this in my country compared to others. Using the above example of the 100-person country with three Covid-19 deaths, the mortality rate would be 3%, no matter how many people were tested. 
The Johns Hopkins data used by many news outlets, including CNN and others, presents a table with information on the 20 countries most affected by Covid-19. During the interview, Wallace showed CFR results (though he called them mortality rates) and said, correctly, that US is 7th (it is now 10th) among these 20 countries -- nowhere near ""number one"" lowest in the world. 
Even worse? From the way Kayleigh McEnany quickly produced the tables upon thePresident's request, it appears that the information used by the White House in the interview might be used in their decision-making as well. 
Their statistics are pulled from another (non-American) source, Our World in Data compiled by the UK's Oxford University. This data uses CFR and, unfortunately for those hoping the President will see the unfiltered truth, allows anyone to select as many or as few countries as they wish to frame the crisis according to their specific goals. 
Though it is difficult to discern in the interview video (at about 2:45 in), President Trump used a graph that included information on only seven countries. In this group, the US ranked 4th (to my eye) with a CFR worse than Iceland, Brazil and South Korea. Again, even with the White House's carefully curated data, the US is mediocre at best. 
An even more sobering view of how the US is doing is our actual mortality rate per 100,000 people (not CFR). Using this metric in the Johns Hopkins data, the US has the 17th worst mortality rate of the 20 most affected countries. 
The number or rate of deaths from Covid-19 in the United States is a disaster no matter what metric is used. And it is clear from the interview that President Trump willingly presents misinformation he is given, even as the cameras are rolling. 
But perhaps the most disturbing aspect of watching the interview is how strongly it suggests that the data being given to the President is deliberately incomplete.
He is informed, apparently, of how the US ranks in CFR against six other countries using the metric that public health experts view as inferior to the mortality rate. 
At every step of the way, it seems, those entrusted to present the truth to the President have chosen instead to willingly protect their own well-being over that of the people of the United States."

As many countries roll out bailout packages to counter the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report says investment in these four key ocean intervention areas could help aid economic recovery both now and in the future:
-- Conservation and restoration of mangroves
-- Decarbonization of the shipping industry
-- Scaling up offshore wind production
-- Increasing sustainable protein from the ocean 
""They give jobs and livelihoods to people and communities and you're doing so by investing in making your environment more sustainable,"" said Manaswita Konar, lead author of the report. The study found that these four areas all give between five and 10 times the return on investment in terms of economic, environmental and health benefits, and could provide minimum net returns of $8.2 trillion over 30 years.
The report builds on research last year from the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy showing how ocean-based climate action can provide a fifth of the carbon emissions cuts needed to achieve the Paris Climate Accord goal of only 1.5 degrees of global warming.
New research shows that global temperatures could exceed that 1.5 degrees target in the next five years.
The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy is a coalition of 14 world leaders focused on developing a sustainable ocean economy. The group includes Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and leaders from Norway, Jamaica, Indonesia, Mexico and Kenya.
The world's oceans support 3.5% to 7% of global GDP, a number set to double by 2030, according to the report. Marine ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses sequester more carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests and also provide invaluable coastal protection against hurricanes and sea level rise, which are exacerbated by climate change.
With the world's population due to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, sustainable low-carbon sources of protein from the ocean, like fish and shellfish, can help reduce the pressure on emissions-intensive, land-based farming of livestock such as beef and lamb. 
The new report details how these benefits or ""ocean services"" are increasingly under threat due to pollution, rising human population, overfishing and climate change. Some of these factors have already led to devastating acidification of coral reefs and loss of biodiversity in recent years, with over a third of corals and marine mammals threatened with extinction. 
""Often the ocean is portrayed ... as a victim of climate change and now also as a victim of the economic crisis post-Covid, but rarely do we think about ocean-based investments and solutions in terms of addressing these challenges,"" said Konar. 
In light of the economic challenges facing many governments worldwide, there has been a concerted push from environmental groups to pressure policymakers to stick to their commitments on carbon emissions and help stimulate a greener economy, amid concerns that climate action could take a backseat to short-term economic recovery. 
The International Energy Agency has released a report produced with the International Monetary Fund calling for a $3 trillion investment in green recovery with the potential to create around 9 million jobs a year. 
The ocean economy has been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, facing huge losses from downturns in tourism, fisheries and shipping.
""The challenge for ocean protection is there's a tendency to use the pandemic not to do the management that we already agreed to do,"" according to Jackie Savitz, chief policy officer for America ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana. 
Savitz said she has seen moves to weaken fisheries management in the US rather than make them more sustainable. ""We have to be careful we don't undo all the good work we've done to date.""
The good news is she says that in many ways, ocean protection needn't be a huge financial investment for cash-strapped governments.
For example, strategies like setting science-based limits on fishing so that stocks can recover, practicing selective fishing to protect endangered species and ensuring that fishing gear doesn't destroy ocean habitats are all effective, cost-efficient ways to manage sustainable fisheries. 
""For a lot of it, it's just good management,"" said Savitz. ""The real high cost comes in political will and making the right decisions that benefit citizens in the future. And unfortunately, that seems to be the hardest thing to do."""

""We are now having 40,000 cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around,"" Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing.
Turning it around will take a coordinated, collaborative effort, he said at the hearing, not the ""disparate responses"" the nation has shown so far. 
But without strong national leadership, that coordination may be up to mayors and governors, according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former biotechnology executive and professor at Harvard's medical and public health schools.
""This situation is now so grim and is getting worse by the day,"" he said. ""From now on, they know it's in their backyard and their job to take care of it if no one else does.""
Most of the US has the pandemic in their backyard, with only two states showing a downward trend in cases from last week. The surge comes as restriction-fatigued Americans increasingly gather in large groups for summer recreation.
Precautions like social distancing and mask wearing are meant to help people ""enjoy themselves within the safe guidelines,"" Fauci said.
""We should not look at the public health endeavors as being an obstruction to opening up. We should look at it as a vehicle to opening up,"" he said. 
Turning the tide means more masks and less bars
The measures health experts tout to curb the virus are especially important considering more than 90% of the country has not experienced the virus, meaning herd immunity could still be years away, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Senate HELP committee on Tuesday. 
Both Redfield and Fauci stressed the importance of widespread masks, which experts have encouraged for months even as President Donald Trump has noticeably forgone them.
An environment with universal masks is ""fundamentally the most important thing we can do,"" Redfield said.
What people shouldn't do in this pandemic, Fauci said Tuesday, is head to the bar. 
""Bars: really not good, really not good. Congregation at a bar, inside, is bad news. We really have got to stop that,"" Fauci said Tuesday.
Without those measures, Fauci said, the US will continue to be in trouble.

Officials in California and Florida -- two states where coronavirus cases are jumping -- are taking different approaches toward reopening amid spikes in infections.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told the reporters that there's no going back to stricter measures, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom hinted that on Wednesday he'll tighten restrictions this Independence Day weekend, especially at beaches.
As the holiday weekend looms, Newsom warned that family gatherings -- where households tend to let down their guards mixing with extended family -- are the greatest concern.
""It's not just bars, not just out in the streets with people protesting, and the like,"" Newsom said.
Newsom ordered bars in seven counties to close over the weekend and said he will announce more restrictions on Wednesday.
Newsom has repeatedly promised that reopening the state comes with the ability to ""toggle back"" if necessary.
Responding to a reporter's question about the beaches being closed in Los Angeles County for the Independence Day weekend, the governor hinted that state beaches could be part of his announcement.
In Florida, DeSantis assured reporters that his state can deal with the uptick in cases and it's not necessary to shut down shops and restaurants.
""We're not going back, closing things,"" he said. ""I mean, people going to business is not what's driving it.""
DeSantis' message to Floridians, particularly the younger ones: Protect the vulnerable.
""You have a responsibility not to come into close contact with folks who could be more vulnerable,"" he said.
Many cases are undetected
Cases in Florida have increased more than 50% from last week, and experts have warned the state could become the next epicenter, similar to New York in the spring.
But DeSantis said he rejected experts' predictions, adding that the state can handle whatever comes.
""People were predicting you know 400,000 people hospitalized, never came,"" he told CNN's Randi Kaye. While cases are rising, he said that the percentage of tests coming back positive is still ""low"" at 10% to 15%.
But US Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Mark McClellan, said Tuesday that the real case numbers may be higher than reported -- and the number of new cases may already be at 100,000 per day.
""Remember, a lot of cases are going undetected because not everybody can get testing,"" McClellan told Jim Acosta on The Situation Room.
And he predicts things will get worse before they get better.
""It just really emphasizes the importance of taking further steps, on wearing masks, on pausing reopening, on taking steps ahead of July 4th to avoid big crowds,"" McClellan said.

It's a problem that people across the country need to be on the lookout for, the CDC says. The bacteria, which can cause deadly pneumonia, grow in warm or stagnant water.
The plumbing in buildings that have been closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic could provide a perfect breeding ground for Legionella and other waterborne pathogens, the CDC cautions.
It even happened to the CDC itself.
""During the recent closures at our leased space in Atlanta, working through the General Services Administration (GSA), CDC directed the landlord to take protective actions,"" the CDC said in a statement to CNN.
""Despite their best efforts, CDC has been notified that Legionella, which can cause Legionnaires' Disease, is present in a cooling tower as well as in some water sources in the buildings. Out of an abundance of caution, we have closed these buildings until successful remediation is complete.""
Legionella bacteria are common in water everywhere. They're usually only a problem when the water gets aerosolized and people breathe it in. Showers and fountains are common sources. The name dates back to 1976, when an outbreak among people at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia affected 182 people and killed 29 of them.
People most at risk include the elderly, smokers, people with suppressed immune systems and diabetics.
Last year, the CDC reports, 4,294 cases were reported. So far this year, 1,813 cases have been reported.
It's not yet clear if the pandemic has worsened the problem, or perhaps eased it because people are not gathering at large hotels or working in big factory buildings as much, said Chris Edens, an epidemiologist on CDC's Legionella team. He said state health departments that normally monitor and report cases of Legionella infection are tied up dealing with coronavirus.
And no national entity systematically checks buildings to see if the bacteria has started growing in the plumbing. ""There is currently no nationwide surveillance of water systems for Legionella disease,"" Edens said.
As people return to work and start to travel more, hospitals and clinics need to think about the possibility of Legionella, Edens said. ""Flu and coronavirus are not the only things that can cause severe pneumonia,"" he said. If people turn up with pneumonia, it's worth testing them for Legionella -- especially since it can be treated with antibiotics, unlike flu or coronavirus.
Many different buildings could be at risk, and building managers need to be aware during prolonged closures. ""We are talking hotels, we are talking large office buildings, we are even talking certain kinds of factories ... a lot of those buildings have been shut down,"" Edens told CNN.
""This water has been sitting and could be at risk of Legionella growth.""
Poorly maintained cooling towers are another potential source.
The fix is not difficult. ""You want to keep the cold water cold and you want to keep your hot water hot,"" Edens said. Legionella flourishes at temperatures between 80° and 120° Fahrenheit. It's killed by chlorination and other disinfecting routines, but the bacteria can grow into mats that create hard-to-dislodge sludge inside pipes, Edens said.
""One of the things that we typically recommend in buildings that have been disused is flushing,"" he said.
""That can be as simple as turning the faucet on. Let cold or hot water course through the system. Keep that water moving.""
Legionella is not the only risk, by the way. ""There's lots of different waterborne pathogens,"" Edens said. ""There are certainly other bugs out there.""
The CDC warns about them on its website.
""These can include other microbial hazards, such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, changes in water chemistry that lead to corrosion, leaching of metals (such as lead) into stagnant water, disinfection by-products, and sewer gases that enter buildings through dry sanitary sewer drain traps,"" it says."

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. 
 (CNN)The sudden and deadly appearance of Covid-19 has shaken our nations around the world to their core. Governments were caught by surprise, unprepared to battle a pandemic within their own borders. But here's the thing: We in the conservation community weren't surprised at all. 
For years we've been warning that human destruction of wild ecosystems is upsetting nature's delicate balance and putting wildlife -- and humans -- at risk, while leading to dangerous and potentially irreversible climate change. Sadly, it's humanity's mistreatment of nature that has brought the devastation that we now see as a result of Covid-19. 
Scientists are working to contain the spread of the virus, and will likely find a cure or a vaccine. But what then? The global pandemic has brought the world to its collective knees, and when we all can finally get up, we'll need to make some big changes in the way we live on this planet, our only home. 
My career in science has been focused on studying and conserving gorillas. Our efforts in Rwanda to protect the ""gorillas in the mist,"" made famous by our founder and namesake Dian Fossey, have contributed to a rare conservation success story. Dian thought mountain gorillas would be extinct by the year 2000, but instead, they are coming back from the brink, with their numbers slowly but steadily growing over the past three decades. 
With just over 1,000 mountain gorillas remaining on the planet, they remain at risk and are a conservation dependent species. However, their story clearly shows that through effective governmental leadership, on-the-ground partnership, and community-based initiatives to improve quality of life for people living nearby, we can change the tide for a species on the brink of extinction -- and for the planet. 
In addition to our field operations in Rwanda, we work to conserve critically endangered Grauer's gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Unlike their cousin, the mountain gorilla, Grauer's numbers are decreasing rapidly. By 2015, an estimated 77% of Grauer's gorillas were lost in two decades, primarily as a result of poaching tied to the often illegal trade in conflict minerals used in small electronics, like cellular phones. These gorillas' population plummeted from 16,900 individuals to just approximately 3,800, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. What happens if gorillas disappear from this complex ecosystem? 
Gorillas inhabit the Congo basin, the second largest tropical rainforest in the world. It stretches across six countries, from the DRC in the east all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. At the Fossey Fund, we are working with local communities to protect 1,300 square kilometers of this forest and its inhabitants. We need the forests of the Congo basin and other tropical areas to remain intact and healthy -- not just for wildlife, but for humanity's sake. They serve as the ""lungs"" of our planet, by taking in carbon dioxide (tropical forests absorb roughly 14% of human caused carbon emissions) and releasing oxygen. However, recent studies show the Congo basin forests are losing their ability to absorb carbon, likely a result of decreased growth from increasing drought and heat. To put it simply, climate change is now affecting our best natural defense against climate change. 
This makes gorillas, and the thousands of other species that live in these forests, even more important. They play a critical role in maintaining the health of these ecosystems. Think of gorillas as gardeners -- they spread seeds by eating, distribute fertilizer through defecating, and help shape plant communities through their foraging and nest building behaviors. 
Human exploitation of the earth's remaining wild places, like the Congo basin, is destroying habitats at an unprecedented rate. In 2017 alone, we lost 39 million acres of tropical rainforest -- the equivalent of 40 football fields each minute. We are also decimating wildlife populations, with more than one million species now threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. 
And there are serious effects on humans themselves. These forests are our best natural defense against climate change. And as Covid-19 has brought into stark relief, by destroying nature we are creating the perfect conditions for disease transmission. Ebola. Zika. West Nile. Lyme. HIV. These are all diseases that, like the novel coronavirus, existed in animal populations before they were able to successfully make the leap to humans. 
People-focused wildlife conservation provides one avenue to preserving wild spaces and stopping this animal-to-human disease ""jump."" For example, our work in the DRC provides jobs, education and increased access to food resources, raising the standard of living for Congolese families. This in turn protects gorillas, along with the plants, animals and insects that share their habitat. It keeps the forest ecosystems of central Africa intact and pristine, ensuring that the trees retain their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, slowing climate change and protecting us all. 
Covid-19 has made abundantly clear that our assault on the world's biodiversity is also an assault on ourselves. It has proven that we can no longer afford to dismiss the problems scientists and conservationists uncover in faraway places. As forests are destroyed, people and wildlife increasingly come into contact; as the commercial wildlife trade expands, the crossover of diseases from animals to people occurs. 
We simply must take better care of the natural world. Healthy ecosystems are some of our best defenses against the challenges climate change is bringing. 
In the past, it has seemed a herculean effort to effect the major changes that are needed to address the underlying causes of environmental destruction, from poverty to excessive consumerism. However, I believe Covid-19 has taught us some important lessons. We have witnessed a global mobilization in the fight against this virus. We've seen the research community focus intensive efforts and resources on vaccines and therapies; we've seen industry adapt manufacturing capabilities to produce needed medical equipment and supplies, or to adopt teleworking practices that enable workers to socially distance; and we've seen individuals and families make personal sacrifices for the greater good. We're also seeing nature's ability to heal itself, as noticeably clearer skies and waterways emerged in a relatively short period of time, as human activities slowed dramatically under social distancing and shelter-in-place protocols. 
We can learn from this experience. We can choose to return to ""normal,"" or we can use this break to rethink the way we collectively prioritize our health, safety and wellbeing. We can make individual choices to buy sustainable products, recycle, and walk or bike rather than drive. We can make choices as a society to elect leaders who are informed by science and reason, rather than hunches or ideology. We can bring the resources of governments, industry and academia to bear to prevent the next deadly virus from emerging. 
We need to muster the political will to scale people-focused conservation to protect broader swaths of habitat worldwide. The natural world is trying to send us a message, but we need to listen.
The world's response to coronavirus has demonstrated that we can do big things if we work together. Let's learn from this hard lesson our planet is teaching us and start working to heal our forests, our planet and ourselves."

The study was published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It follows a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine that also showed the drug doesn't fight the virus. 
Even before these reports were published, the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health issued warnings about using the drugs for coronavirus patients. 
In the most recent study, researchers at the University at Albany looked at 1,438 patients with coronavirus who were admitted to 25 New York City area hospitals. After statistical adjustments, the death rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine was similar to those who did not take the drug. The death rate for those taking hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, was also similar. 
However, the patients who took the drug combination were more than twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest during the course of the study. Heart issues are a known side effect of hydroxychloroquine. 
""The big takeaway for me from this study is that it's very consistent with the FDA and NIH guidelines that came out in April,"" said one of the study's senior authors, David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany. ""When deciding on public health interventions and treatments for Covid-19 or any other disease, it's really important to follow the data and follow the science and make sure decisions are being made on the highest quality data possible."" 
This study likely won't be the last word on the drugs. Researchers at the University of Washington, New York University and other centers are still testing the drug in patients. 
In the clinical trials, coronavirus patients are randomly assigned to take the drugs or to take placebos, which have no effect, and then the death rates between the two groups will compared. These types of studies are considered the most reliable.
Trump's enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine 
Starting in mid-March, President Trump became a frequent cheerleader for hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and other diseases and the antibiotic azithromycin, often sold under the brand name Zithromax, or as a""Z-pack."" 
He promoted the drugs nearly 50 times, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not. 
""HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,"" Trump tweeted on March 21. 
Fox News frequently echoed Trump, but both the network and the president quieted down about the drugs once studies started showing they didn't work and possibly could hurt. 
No difference in death rates 
Trump's enthusiasm for the drugs was based on a French study of 20 patients in March that showed the drugs might work against the virus. That study was criticized for poor methodology, with experts calling it ""pathetic"" and ""a complete failure."" 
The medical society that published that study later said the study ""does not meet the Society's expected standard."" 
But the study was enough to excite Trump, and enough to excite doctors, who were free to prescribe the drugs because they're both already on the market to treat patients with other illnesses. 
The latest study in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at the medical records of 18% of all coronavirus patients hospitalized in the New York City area from March 15 to March 28. 
In this group, doctors prescribed both drugs to 735 patients, just hydroxychloroquine to 271 patients, just azithromycin to 211 patients and neither drug to 221 patients. 
They found that those taking hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with the antibiotic, were sicker than other patients to begin with and as time went on had a higher death rate. However, once the researchers statistically adjusted for the fact that the patients who took the drugs were sicker to start with, there was no statistical significance between the two death rates. 
Overall, the patients had a 20% death rate. 
The patients in the study were in the hospital, and other research teams are studying whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus infection or slow it down in the beginning stages of the disease.

The pushback underscores how House Democratic leaders are being attacked on all sides over the legislation -- by congressional Republicans, who have dismissed the legislation as an liberal wish list, as well as within their own ranks by both progressives and moderates. 
Despite the criticism from both progressives and moderates, House Democrats leaders have expressed confidence that the package will pass the House on Friday. It is not expected to be taken up by the Senate, however, due to Republican opposition. 
Progressives have expressed frustration that the bill does not go far enough to provide aid to Americans dealing with economic fallout, while some moderates are voicing concern over the massive price tag of the plan and the fact that it does not have widespread bipartisan support. 
Freshman Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn, a moderate who flipped an Oklahoma House seat from red to blue in 2018, strongly criticized the Democratic leadership's $3 trillion coronavirus response bill on Thursday, saying that she won't vote for it.
""Messaging bills without bipartisan support are a disservice to the American people, especially during a time of crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship, this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most.""
Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman from Michigan in a swing district, told CNN on Thursday that she has ""concerns"" with the $3 trillion price tag and said ""I'm undecided"" on whether she will vote for the plan on Friday. 
Slotkin said that she's trying to weigh ""the positives for my district against some of the negatives."" 
""What I wanted to see in this package is sticking to the very specific emergency need that the country has, and so I feel like there are a lot of things that I pushed for, and I believe in, especially money for our cities and towns. There's money for testing, like really critical things, and then there are some things that I don't feel like had to be in the bill, and what I'm trying to decide is does the net positive outweigh that negative,"" she said. 
Moderate freshmen Democrats like Horn and Slotkin represent the kind of frontline, battleground districts that will be heavily contested in the fall as Republicans try to win back the House majority they lost to Democrats in 2018. 
The voices of these vulnerable Democrats carry outsized influence within the House Democratic caucus with Democratic leaders recognizing the importance of holding onto those seats to maintain their majority. 
Pelosi defended the bill against attacks that it is partisan during a press conference on Thursday, saying, ""We're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation."" 
Congressional Republicans have argued that it is too early to pass another far-reaching measure and have instead urged waiting to see what the impact will be of the already-enacted relief packages so far. 
And while GOP leaders and the White House oppose the Democratic plan, at least one House Republican intends to vote for the bill: Rep. Pete King. 
The New York Republican plans to vote for the measure, according to his spokesman Kevin Fogarty."

Close calls can put the fragility of our lives into high relief, making our daily existence all the more meaningful. But this grueling slog of a pandemic strains the limits of normal resilience. And allowing your anxiety to peak can result in serious health consequences. 
The novel coronavirus pandemic can make it seem impossible to look away from the storm on the horizon. And what a monster it is: Covid-19's first wave is building into a tsunami threatening a growing number of states. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the nation, says we could reach 100,000 cases dailynationwide. In these circumstances, rising stress levels are inevitable. Covid-19 has already ""infected"" our minds whether or not it ever enters our bodies. Now's the time to work methodically on treating your pandemic brain.
The onrush of critical Covid-19 cases into our hospitals is of course the biggest single problem the nation faces. But for many individuals with no trace of the virus in their bodies, pandemic stress reactions are also tipping the scales toward medical catastrophe. 
I'm a doctor who deals exclusively in the world of life-changing injuries, working at a large Atlanta hospital treating patients from throughout the southeastern US and beyond. 
It's not uncommon that headlines in the news are soon reflected in the folks coming through our doors, whether a scooter craze resulting in head injuries, or a mass shooting's victims or, certainly, a rapidly spreading infectious disease. But it takes a global event like this to land such a collection of stress-related consequences at one particular hospital or with one particular doctor. 
I'm used to patients reporting particularly stressful events happening at the time of the heart attacks or strokes that land them in my care. We know there's a clear link between stress, anxiety and your cardiovascular health. Now they're reporting business closures. 
I'm seeing anxiety managed with alcohol or drugs become cardiac arrest. I'm also seeing delayed medical care with disabling consequences and reckless behaviors (another unhealthy response to stress) resulting in life-altering injury. 
For every person whose stress rises to the level that they've suffered a heart attack or stroke, there are many more people who simply experience a barely perceptible sustained increase in blood pressure or a tiny uptick in inflammatory biomarkers circulating in the bloodstream. In time, there may be consequences.
I can't imagine a set of prior life experiences that could fully inoculate one from worry. In any given week I see families through a loved one's twilight states of unconsciousness and semiconsciousness, facilitating deliberations over when to push forward and when it may be time to let go. 
After being saturated with such problems daily for a decade now, you might assume a global pandemic couldn't rock my psyche much in the way of life or death fear. You'd be wrong. None of us were ready for this.
Anxiety is natural, but keeping your brain constantly plugged into a smartphone -- a handheld conduit to all the world's problems -- is decidedly unnatural. ""Doomscrolling"" makes 2020's anxieties synthetically supercharged.
Even with mask-wearing and avoiding crowds it's not fully in our control when we will contract Covid-19. It's certainly not up to us how we will fare when it takes hold. 
But we have a level of control over the way we react to this new reality, where we direct our attention and for how long, and how deliberately we manage our moments. Of course, it doesn't help that just as anxiety and depression are spiking, professional help is harder than ever to access. (Though the national suicide prevention lifeline is always available to connect people to the care they need. If you need this service, call 1-800-273-8255).
Now don't get me wrong, just because you worry about Covid-19 does not mean you have a stroke coming around the corner. Underlying risk factors are typically required to see stress translate into a major cardiovascular event. At the same time, many adults do have some risk factors, often unbeknownst to them. 
Situational factors -- say the events of a pandemic or world war -- are often going to be at play in whether any particular person's stroke or heart attack happens on one given day versus another. And we're seeing a whole lot more of these health incidents now because of the pandemic.
Washington Post data analysts pored over three months of pandemic data from five states to determine that there were 8,300 more cardiovascular disease related deaths than expected in those states. 
The deaths aren't from Covid-19 directly, but many were likely due to delayed care, and perhaps in some cases, they were the result of pandemic stress, similar to my own clinical observations. 
Last week the Journal of the American Medical Association also published a data analysis suggesting that Covid-19 death counts significantly underreport the true number of deaths related to the pandemic through health impacts like these. 
For every pandemic-stress related death, there are many more survivors with near-death experiences, like the patients I treat.
No doctor can prescribe that your business will breeze through what's happening, or that you don't lose your insurance or fall victim to the many other of the factors making lives go haywire right now. I can't tell you to make sure no one in your family ends up in the hospital for weeks, separated and suffering. 
Still, there are some things we can do to try to maintain our physical and mental well-being while accepting that no, everything isn't alright. Doing what we can to manage our personal pandemic stress reactions, while accepting more of what we can't change, will be one key to our survival.
The treatment I'd prescribe calls for conscious disconnection, then elective reconnection to what's really important in your life. Manage untoward events where you realistically can do so. Let the rest wash overboard. Go data dry for a day. Build from there.
As everything moves online -- our work lives, social lives, and more of our basic services, including our health care -- this may seem like an impossible goal. Use some of the growing assortment of tools to help you lessen your screen time and protect all the screen-free time you can wring out of your days and weeks. 
I'm trying to stick to the prescription myself, increasingly disconnecting for much of the day during weekends and hoping to continue. 
Does it sound trite to recommend a hobby too? Doesn't it also sound a little underwhelming to recommend exercise and a heart-healthy diet -- especially following a heart attack? 
The treatment works, however low-tech it may be. The same exercise and diet that can help your heart can also help calm your pandemic brain.
Manage your consumption of 2020's malignant political scene in the same way that you attempt to limit your dessert intake. We can't turn away from our democracy at these critical moments. But engage judiciously. I teach families that they have to take time for and care for themselves in order to care for their loved one. The same can be said when caring for our troubled democracy. 
It's appropriate to grieve the world and the innocence we've lost. And we should not underestimate the lasting effects of this stress on our health. The ripple effects here aren't a mere ""butterfly effect."" The pandemic is more of a charging hippopotamus effect. Intentionally coping with and managing the unfortunate reality, while dodging the hippo as best we can, just became part of the job description for every adult. 
Survival is in question now, but in reality, that has always been the case. The ways we interact and how we do business are changing, much of it for the long term. But life has always been subject to change. Some degree of acceptance of these facts, if you can muster it, will help lower your anxiety. 
Puzzles, painting, hikes, kayaking, adopting a dog, games with friends online -- find whatever works to move your gaze off the storm on the horizon. For those who can afford camping trips and are boosting the RV sales around the country, that's a great response. Same with the home exercise equipment, so long as you use it! You've got to be deliberate in adding new social and physical routines to your weekly mix. 
What kept you healthy in 2019 won't be good enough for the rest of 2020. So maybe add in some meditation or try mindfulness exercises. I'm not a practitioner, but agree it sounds like a good idea (I'd rather weed the garden). Whatever new activities you pick, be prepared and willing to change it up. Change is about the only thing we can count on."

15,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Nick Valencia and Jason Morris, CNN",Covid-19 in the classroom becomes stark reality for parents,"Cherokee County in Georgia opened up its schools for in-person learning. Within days, the numbers of confirmed Covid-19 infections and quarantines were making some parents change their minds about their children going to school.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/12/us/georgia-schools-parents-coronavirus-wellness/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200807223019-cherokee-county-school-district-quarantine-super-tease.jpg,2020-08-12T13:53:47Z,"Woodstock, Georgia (CNN)It's Sunday in Woodstock, Georgia, and the local park is packed with families. It should be an ordinary sight, but father of six Jamie Chambers says, in the age of Covid-19, scenes like this keep him up at night.
""We all want it to be normal, we all want our regular lives back and I have nothing but sympathy and empathy for people who do, but we're not living in normal times,"" he told CNN. ""And that's the thing, people are just choosing to live as if it is, until it's impossible to ignore.""
The number of quarantines since schools in Woodstock and the rest of Cherokee County opened last week is just that -- impossible to ignore. At least 478 students and teachers were asked to quarantine after possible exposure to Covid-19 in the first five days of classes. By early Tuesday, that number had swelled to 925 students and staff. Nearly one-third of the district's schools -- which teach 30,000 students from elementary to high -- have been impacted.
Chambers, who fears the coronavirus will spread throughout the area, which is about 30 minutes north of Atlanta, says he saw this coming. He, along with other district parents, received a letter from Cherokee County School Superintendent Brian Hightower in mid-July announcing a 77-page reopening plan. 
""One day later it was voted on, with limited opportunity for the public to participate,"" Chambers said of the vote, which was limited to those who were able to show up last-minute. ""When the committee that created the reopening plan was created there were no teachers on it and teachers were not given a chance to review it before it was published for the public.""
Chambers became a well-known local activist after he wrote an open letter to the superintendent blasting the reopening plan.
""I see little evidence that guidelines from (the US Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health) were a guiding factor in creating these policies. In fact, your plan seems to repeatedly soften or ignore their recommendations altogether while seeming to envision a 'best case scenario' when it comes to young people complying with these changing rules and the teachers' ability to monitor and enforce them,"" wrote Chambers, a game designer.
The plan now in place in schools means students do not social distance and adults do not wear facial coverings. Chambers believes students going in-person are at risk and is keeping his 10-year-old and 4-year-old at home. 
CNN reached out to Superintendent Hightower, who declined an interview. The school district's chief communications officer, Barbara P. Jacoby, said: ""(O)ur communications efforts are focused on directly communicating with parents.""
On Tuesday, Hightower told parents Etowah High School in Woodstock would have close to in-person learning from the end of the day until at least August 31. There have been 14 positive coronavirus cases at the school, he said, with tests pending for another 15 students. Some 294 students and staff have been asked to quarantine.
Hightower urged people to social distance and wear masks. ""As your Superintendent, I wear a mask whenever I cannot social distance. We know all parents do not believe the scientific research that indicates masks are beneficial, but I believe it and see masks as an important measure to help us keep schools open,"" he wrote to parents. 
Requiring masks is a decision that is being left up to individual schools in Cherokee County. Across Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has encouraged mask-wearing but ruled out any mandates and says he supports local decision-making.
A little north of Woodstock, Brandy Heath thought that sending her fourth and sixth graders back into classrooms at Freedom Middle and Liberty Elementary in Canton was definitely the better option for their learning. 
""I sent my son to face-to-face learning because, as any parent knows, school is the best place for our children. Their teachers are educated, and they can teach things to our kids that we can't,"" she told CNN.
""However, the second day of school my son said to me, 'Mom, I'm not feeling safe. We're not social distancing, there's no precautions being taken to keep us safe,'"" Heath told CNN of her fourth grader.
As soon as she heard that, Heath, who says she is immuno-compromised, pulled her kids back home for distance learning. 
""We expected the Cherokee County School District to keep our kids safe. To take precautions that ensure their safety. And it's not being done,"" she said.
Back on the playground in Woodstock, Jamie Chambers said he feels sometimes like he's fighting a losing battle. In this deeply conservative part of Georgia, he says politics continue to be put before science, with even some school officials telling staff that they believe the coronavirus is a hoax, he said.
Some of the parents at the park appeared less concerned about the virus. 
""I don't regret sending my kids to school,"" the mother of a fourth and fifth grader, who declined to give her name, told CNN. ""They're either going to get the virus in school or outside of school, might as well send them back."""

Masks are selling out like crazy, sellers are price-gouging, and somehow, someway people are selling awful merch tied to the deadly, rapidly spreading virus that's officially named COVID-19. 
Amazon, particularly, is a nerve-racking site to visit amid the crisis.
A cursory search for a coronavirus mask or a surgical mask turns up lots of options, but they're either sold out and expected to be out of stock for weeks or they are exceptionally costly. A pack of 100 disposable masks, for instance, has about quadrupled in price over the last few weeks to $15, Wired reported.  Some bulk foods appear difficult to purchase. In Italy which is suffering through the largest European outbreak hand sanitizer prices have reportedly skyrocketed online.
It's worth noting masks aren't even recommended unless you're actively coughing/sneezing or if you're taking care of someone who is sick. Experts do recommend washing your hands frequently and washing your hands correctly and avoiding touching your face. 
The rush to purchase these supplies has appeared in lockstep with the stress that's overtaken people in the U.S. as the virus continues to spread throughout the world. However, an expert told Mashable that this doesn't necessarily mean people are panicking. In some ways, stocking up is a method of taking control.
""People wanting to be proactive about their well-being is not necessarily indicative of panic,"" said Dr. Samantha Penta, an assistant professor of emergency preparedness at the University at Albany's College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity.
Still, it can prove to be an unproductive cycle. Attempting to buy supplies online, if what you're after has already been pillaged, can ramp up anxiety. The world which has 150 million Prime users relies heavily on Amazon. It's odd and discomforting to see it without products. Not to mention, it's a little scary to even feel the need to parse through emergency supplies in the first place. 
A pack of masks retailing for $67 that apparently wouldn't ship for weeks.

Amazon, meanwhile, said it's working to stop merchants from taking advantage of the crisis.
""There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,"" an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. ""We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers. We continue to actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.""
Amazon previously sent an email warning merchants about masks that were not in compliance with pricing policies, according to Wired. 
No doubt, it's a frightening time. There have to date been more than 83,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. 
""Do not mistake me: I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, on Wednesday. ""Every scenario is still on the table.""
Even in this time of potential crisis, some folks are trying to capitalize on the virus by selling surprisingly lighthearted merch. Asthe Vergepointed out, there are coronavirus shirts all over Amazon that look like something you'd get off a New Jersey boardwalk. The t-shirts feature pretty tasteless jokes from everything about Corona beer to ""keep calm and resist coronavirus.""

Worse still, Amazon like just about anywhere online is full of information of questionable validity. It has had to remove more than 1 million products that falsely claimed they were a coronavirus cure. People are also selling books making all kinds of unproven claims like Satan or biological warfare caused the outbreak, Business Insider reported. 
There have been all kinds of responses online, from these ""joking"" t-shirts to social media sites filled with worrying, if often questionable, information. 
""I think something thats important to drive home is that this is a consistently evolving situation,"" Penta said. ""Its just important to not fill the gaps with false information."" 
While the internet might be stressful during the coronavirus outbreak, experts have stressed it's not time for folks to panic.
""It's good to take precautions, but you don't have to live in fear."" Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon."

Two attendees and two individuals ""supporting the event"" tested positive, according to an official release from Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located. 
A spokesman for the party said the individuals tested positive upon arriving at the convention and were immediately sent home. In all, 792 Covid-19 tests were given to people who attended or provided support to the convention in Charlotte, the county said.
The city was originally going to host the entire Republican convention, but coronavirus-related concerns limited activities there to largely party business earlier this week rather than speeches, and much of the event was remote or held in Washington, DC.
""These individuals were immediately issued isolation instructions and any known close contacts were notified and issued quarantine instructions by Mecklenburg County Public Health,"" the county said.
Many Republicans, most prominently President Donald Trump, have downplayed the ongoing spread of coronavirus and disregarded the need for safety measures such as avoiding large crowds and wearing masks in an urge to return the country to normalcy. 
When he accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday evening at the White House, Trump appeared in front of an audience that was virtually entirely mask-less and attendees were sitting in close proximity to one another. And those who attended first lady Melania Trump's speech in the White House Rose Garden earlier this week were not required to get tested, a person who attended the speech has told CNN.
Trump had long insisted on holding a full, in-person convention in Charlotte as planned before the pandemic, only to back down following objections from the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who expressed concerns about spreading the virus at such a large event.
Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Friday the party had ""diligent safety protocols in place"" and tested all attendees both before and after they arrived in Charlotte.
""Out of roughly 1,000 tests administered, two RNC attendees, despite having negative tests prior to travel, and two Charlotte locals who planned to serve as event support staff tested positive upon arrival. All were sent home,"" Ahrens said.
North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Austin Cook, referring to news of the positive tests, said the decision to hold even a pared-down convention in Charlotte was a ""slap to the face to the Charlotte community and all North Carolinians.""
Earlier in the summer, the President and his campaign were forced to shelve plans to revive his trademark campaign rallies after an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was poorly attended due to virus concerns. Several members of Trump's campaign tested positive for the virus, as did several Secret Service agents who were present.
Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign event Friday night in New Hampshire, and WMUR reports that the event will adhere to a state requirement that masks are worn at scheduled gatherings of 100 people or more."

Doctors say one of the best ways to monitor patients with COVID-19 is by tracking their blood oxygen levels, which can show when they have dangerous breathing problems even if they dont feel short of breath. But along with toilet paper and digital thermometers, devices that measure those levels, called pulse oximeters, are hard to find. Theyre either sold out or taking weeks to ship from major retailers. 
With the devices out of reach, people are turning to questionable alternatives: the third most popular paid iPhone app last week claims to be able to measure blood oxygen levels through the phones camera, despite a disclaimer that says the app is not a medical device. On Reddit, some people fighting off COVID-19 say theyre using a health feature on some Samsung phone models to check their oxygen levels. Others say theyre using pulse oximetry features on smartwatches. 
That concerns doctors. Despite their accessibility, research shows pulse oximetry apps dont accurately measure blood oxygen levels, especially when theyre low. And relying on apps could be dangerous, says Walter Schrading, director of the office of wilderness medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.
The apps are easy party tricks when youre not sick: put your finger on the camera, get a normal oxygen reading. You can see, Im a normal human being, breathing normal air, he says. But when someone actually has low oxygen levels, theyre likely to still give that normal reading. They dont work well when you actually need them to work well, which is when your oxygen levels drop, Schrading says. 
Schrading and colleagues evaluated three iPhone pulse oximetry apps in a study published in 2019, and found that they couldnt reliably identify people who did not have enough oxygen. Their findings were consistent with other studies, which also found that pulse oximetry apps were inaccurate. A recent analysis from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, which reviewed the research on apps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, also concluded that they are unreliable.
Oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted, the authors of the analysis wrote. 
NEW rapid review by me (small clinical/ editing role) and Lionel Tarassenko, Professor of Electrical Engineering (major bioengineer role):
Q: Can smartphone apps be used to measure oxygen saturation?A: No.https://t.co/iIQqi66tUM
 Trisha Greenhalgh (@trishgreenhalgh) April 2, 2020
Apps dont work well because most use a different mechanism to test blood oxygen levels than standard, medical pulse oximetry devices. The devices send two different wavelengths of light usually red and infrared through a fingertip, where theres lots of blood close to the surface of the skin. Hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in blood, absorbs more infrared light when its carrying oxygen and more red light when its not. The device calculates the difference to determine how much oxygen is circulating. 
Smartphones usually only have white light, so theyre not able to get as accurate a reading. Samsung phones have a red light function, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said, but they only use one wavelength and would likely be unreliable as well.
In addition, standard pulse oximetry devices send light wavelengths through the finger and read the results from a sensor on the other side. Smartphones send and capture the light from the same spot they rely on the reflection of the wavelengths. That method tends to be less accurate and can be skewed by light from the environment. 
Some models of Fitbit and Garmin smartwatches also have pulse oximetry features. Fitbit can track oxygen level trends during sleep, and Garmin can give on-the-spot readings. Their watches do use red light, but they use the less-accurate reflective method. They also take readings from blood flow at the wrist which isnt as strong as it is at the finger. Both companies note on theirwebsites that their devices should not be used for medical purposes. 
Accurate blood oxygen readings are important when people are trying to monitor any disease, but its particularly key for COVID-19. Usually, someone with a low blood oxygen level knows it they struggle to catch their breath. If a person has a reading on a lower-quality oximeter that says they have low oxygen levels, but they dont have those symptoms, doctors can usually assume the sensor just isnt working, wrote James Hudspeth, the COVID response inpatient floor lead at Boston Medical Center, in an email to The Verge. 
People with COVID-19, though, sometimes feel fine even when their oxygen levels are plummeting. Thats why some doctors want pulse oximeters given to everyone home sick with the virus: if they can come into the hospital as soon as their oxygen levels dip but before theyre gasping for air, they might be treated more effectively. But it also means doctors would have less confidence interpreting a pulse oximeter result that doesnt match symptoms, Hudspeth said. 
If apps cant tell when oxygen levels are actually low, they could give a false sense of security to people who also feel okay. This thing could read normal, but you could not be normal, Schrading says. Its a big risk, he says. It would be dangerous to rely on them because they didnt measure what they were supposed to measure.

People are doing a lot more video conferencing now that theyre stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, conduct business with colleagues, and keep up with schoolwork. Sometimes, though, you may want to save a recording of the meeting so you can revisit it later. That could let you listen to a teachers lecture again, use the audio for a podcast, or even relive the announcement of a family pregnancy (which is something that actually happened to me on a recent family video call).
Many services offer ways to record video meetings, even on their free versions. Weve outlined here how to set up recordings for three well-known services: Zoom, Google Meet, and Skype. 
Zoom
Zoom lets you record calls whether youre a free user or a paid user. However, if youre a free user, youll only be able to save recordings to your computer. If you want to save recordings to the cloud, youll need to be on one of the companys paid offerings. Those plans start at $14.99 per user per month for its Pro plan and $1,800 per year for schools. 
Heres how to record a Zoom meeting:
<ul><li>If youre the host of your Zoom call, click the record button on the toolbar at the bottom of the call window to start the recording. If youre on a paid plan, you should see the option to pick between making a local recording or a cloud recording.</li><li>When the recording starts, youll be able to pause or stop the recording using buttons in the top left corner of your screen or on the Zoom toolbar.</li><li>If you opted for a local recording, the call will be converted into a .mp4 file and saved to your computer as soon as you end your meeting. In my testing, Zoom automatically opened the Finder window to the folder with both audio and video versions of the recording.</li><li>If you opted for a cloud recording, when you end your meeting, Zoom will show you a message saying that youll get an email when the recording is ready. For me, that email had a link to Zooms website with audio and video versions of the recording, as well as a password-protected link I could share with others so they could view and download the recording.</li></ul>Zooms website has support documents for cloud recordings, local recordings, and recording using Zooms iOS and Android apps if you want to learn more. The company also put together a helpful video that demonstrates how to record a call when youre using a computer.
Google Meet
For a limited time, anybody who is a G Suite customer should be able to record a call via Google Meet. Thats because Google has opened up free access to recording and other advanced Meet features until September 30th. After that date, video recording in Meet will presumably revert to only being available for customers of G Suite Enterprise, which costs $25 per user per month, and G Suite Enterprise for Education, which costs $48 per user per year (though Google is offering lower promotional pricing until July 31st under certain circumstances). If you plan to host video meetings via the free version of Google Meet thats rolling out over the coming weeks, though, you wont be able to make recordings, Google tells The Verge.
Heres how to record a Google Meet call. Note that I was not able to personally test these steps myself; the recording feature wasnt enabled for the G Suite account I use at work (or for the account of a colleague who has a personal G Suite account). If you dont see the recording option after following the steps below, it may not have rolled out to your account yet, or your companys G Suite settings may not let you make recordings. 
<ul><li>Once youre in the meeting, click the icon with the three vertical dots in the lower right hand of your screen. A menu will appear, and on the top of it, you should see a Record meeting option. Click that to start recording. The meeting organizer or anyone in the same organization as the host can record a meeting, according to Google.</li><li>To stop recording, click the three vertical dots again and click the Stop recording menu option at the top of the list.</li><li>Recordings will be saved to the meeting organizers Google Drive in a folder called Meet Recordings. The organizer will also receive an email with a link to the recording. If you arent the meeting organizer but activated a recording, youll also be emailed a link to the recording. A link to the recording will also be added to the calendar invite. </li></ul>Google has additional details about meeting recordings in this support document, and you can see a video about recording in Meet here.
Skype
Heres how to record a Skype call. 
<ul><li>Youll need to have at least one other person on your call to do a call recording. Once the other person has joined, you should see an option to Start Recording in the bottom left corner of your call window when you move your mouse. Either person can click on that to start a recording. </li><li>To stop recording, click the Stop recording button at the top of the screen or in the same bottom left corner of the window where the Start Recording button was.</li><li>When you end your call, youll be able to access the recording in the Skype app and download it to your computer. Recordings will be available for 30 days.</li></ul>You can also check out Microsofts support document about call recording in Skype if you want to learn more."

Google announced on Thursday that it will bring its SameSite cookie update back starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84. The update will roll out gradually to Chrome 80 and later versions.
When Chrome 80 launched in February, Google started rolling out its SameSite update, which is intended to change how cookies are handled by the browser. In April, Google announced it would be rolling back that update in order to keep essential websites working during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The update will resume starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84
Chrome used to accept cookies by default, but with the introduction of its SameSite labeling policy, Chrome will block cookies from functioning in a third-party context, unless they carry specific labels. This is part of Chromes phased approach to privacy: this is supposed to limit which cookies collect data across sites, and in turn, limit the data those websites collect on users. 
Blocking third-party cookies can cause some websites to break, particularly during the login process, since cookies store your login information across sites and visits. Prior to Google rolling back the update, several sites had been adjusted according to the SameSite policy. However, Google said it wanted to provide stability and continuity during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially for essential services, so it decided to temporarily halt the update with the aim to resume over the summer. 
Google is taking a gradual approach to blocking third-party cookies, since Google is worried that blocking cookies could break some websites. In contrast to Safari and Firefox, which block third-party cookies by default, Chrome has decided to phase them out within two years. Following this incremental plan, earlier this month Google announced Chrome would be blocking third-party cookies in incognito mode. The Chrome team is also working on a set of alternative technologies which are intended to preserve website revenue and allow advertisers to target audiences but without breaking logins to sites or being too invasive for consumers."

In North America and Europe, people usually spend about 90 percent of their time indoors. All that time inside affects our health and happiness, but how? 
Journalist Emily Anthes, author of the new book The Great Indoorstries to answer that question. Its a fascinating read especially at a time when the ongoing pandemic has changed how we spend our time inside. With restaurant dining off the table in many regions with coronavirus-induced lockdowns, people are spending more time cooking and baking at home. Others found themselves growing herb gardens in their kitchens to avoid long lines at grocery stores. The Verge spoke with Anthes about the costs and benefits that might come with some of our new indoor habits, and what we can do to foster a healthy environment at home. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
I really started thinking of our homes as ecosystems.
What got you interested in the ways that indoor spaces affect people?
The spark for the book really came from seeing a lot of studies on what scientists are starting to call the indoor microbiome. What struck me was how diverse and expansive their findings were. They were finding hundreds of thousands of species of bacteria and tens of thousands of species of fungi in homes across America. And so, I really started thinking of our homes as ecosystems.
Most of these creatures or critters or organisms that are in our homes are totally benign. In fact, a lot of them actually come from us. Theres also evidence to suggest that being exposed to a wide range and a rich assortment of microbes, especially early in life, when were kids seems to have a protective effect. It makes us less likely to develop asthma and autoimmune disease later in life. 
So how can I maintain a healthier home microbiome, while reconciling that with the fear of germs Ive developed because of COVID-19?
Thats very much a matter of debate. People are talking about things like home probiotics, and there are actually companies that already sell what they claim are probiotic sprays. And thats almost certainly premature. Partly because we still dont have a good sense of what a healthy home microbiome looks like. Its likely to be complex, not just one magic microbe you can spray around your home. 
When it comes to the coronavirus, I understand its a balance
But there are some good rules of thumb. Moisture is the enemy in general. You might have a lot of dormant fungal spores around your home and theyre typically harmless. But if they get wet, they can grow into mold, which can trigger allergies and other problems. So keep your home dry, keep it well ventilated, make sure not to use antimicrobial products. [Anthes writes in her book that, Bacteria adapt to these chemicals at lightning speed, and using them in our homes could help drive the emergence of new superbugs Moreover, coating the inside of our homes with antimicrobial compounds can wipe out the good microbes along with the bad.] 
When it comes to the coronavirus, I understand its a balance and we want to not have these pathogens in our homes. But it turns out that just soap and water does a really good job of getting rid of it. I would definitely recommend people stick to things like that rather than wipes that are advertised as being antibacterial. 
How might our built environments affect our health if were spending more time at home during the pandemic?
Indoor environments are now the main source of our exposure to air pollution.
One thing that Ive been looking into a little bit is indoor air quality. We know that increasing ventilation and making sure we have fresh air is a really important way to reduce transmission of the disease in indoor spaces. But its also important from the perspective of indoor air pollutants. Thanks to federal regulations, our outdoor air quality has gotten a lot better over recent decades. But indoor air quality remains largely unregulated. So for most of us, certainly here in the US, our indoor environments are now the main source of our exposure to air pollution. 
Spending more time at home does a couple of things. One, it potentially increases the time were spending surrounded by these pollutants. But theres also some data thats emerging to suggest that the air quality in our homes might actually be getting worse as we spend more time at home. Thats partly because two of the main causes of indoor air pollution are cooking and cleaning. Theres anecdotal evidence to say that were doing a lot more of that during the pandemic. 
So, how can we make our homes better for our well-being as we spend more time there during the pandemic? 
The list of benefits is almost endless.
A lot of people have been asking me this lately and my number one go-to recommendation is nature or plants. Theres overwhelming evidence that exposure to greenery and natural landscapes has all these benefits for us from reducing stress, anxiety, pain, boosting mood. The list of benefits is almost endless. And thats something Ive done in my own home. Ive brought a lot more house plants in. But the interesting thing about it is, if youre not really a gardener or youre worried about keeping plants alive, or maybe you dont have a lot of light, it doesnt have to be real plants. Theres evidence to suggest that even photos of nature or even nature sounds can have some of the same stress-relieving effects, and presumably fake plants as well. 
Theres a lot of evidence for the benefits of daylight, which also boosts mood. It keeps us alert during the day when were working. Exposure to lots of daylight during the day helps us sleep better at night. So, a real easy thing to do is make sure you open your curtains when you get up in the morning or raise your blinds. Those are two things that really have a lot of solid research behind them.
As an environmental reporter, Im often exploring how outdoor environments might affect health outcomes or create disparities. How might the way indoor spaces are designed lead to any disparities? 
Its something Ive been thinking about a lot in terms of the pandemic. We see places where the biggest super-spreading events or outbreaks are happening in places like prisons, meatpacking plants, dorms for migrant workers, nursing homes. These are all environments that tend to be home to vulnerable and marginalized people. And I dont think thats an accident that weve created these dense, poorly ventilated spaces that are not great for the spread of infectious disease for people that society tends to shunt aside. 
Obviously, the pandemic is devastating. And if I could snap my fingers and make it go away, I would. But its really made people more aware and conscious of their indoor environments. So I think there is an opening now to think through what kinds of spaces we want to create. Theres an opening and a chance to sort of do a better job of it. Thats something Ill be watching for in the months and years to come."

Chinese EV startup Byton is halting operations for at least six months due to financial problems that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has confirmed to The Verge, following reports from The Detroit Bureau and local media. This comes after employees in China have complained they are collectively owed millions of dollars while the company struggled to complete a $500 million funding round. 
Byton already furloughed hundreds of workers at its North American headquarters in Silicon Valley in April and all but admitted that its first vehicle an all-electric SUV with a massive dashboard screen called the M-Byte would be delayed again due to the impact of the pandemic. This is all despite Byton being backed by Chinas oldest state-owned automaker, First Auto Works (FAW), and having already completed a new factory in Nanjing, China, last year. 
The COVID-19 [pandemic] has posed great challenges to BYTONs funding and business.
Like everywhere, the COVID-19 [pandemic] has posed great challenges to BYTONs funding and business operations, Byton spokesperson Dave Buchko said in a statement to The Verge. As a result, he said, the companys management and its board of directors decided to implement the six-month suspension. Most of the companys employees in China will be furloughed, with only a small group of the team will be retained to stand by for possible business needs.

Byton was founded in 2016 with backing from Chinese internet giant Tencent and Taiwanese manufacturing conglomerate Foxconn by former BMW executives Carsten Breitfeld (who led the i8 program) and Daniel Kirchert. Byton announced the concept version of the M-Byte at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, and shortly after, it revealed that FAW was investing in and partnering with the startup. 
The FAW deal was initially seen as a vote of confidence in what Breitfeld and Kirchert were building, especially since so many other EV startups at the time were struggling for funding and desperate to partner with big OEMs. But it eventually became a source of tension for Breitfeld, who left the startup in early 2019. Last September, as The Verge first reported, Breitfeld said that the Chinese government via FAW pushed the direction of Byton [to a place that was] not in line with what I thought we should do.
Breitfeld said at the time that Byton had used the Nanjing factory and other assets as collateral for the money that FAW invested and that he felt the state-owned automaker was going to drive it to a stage where the whole Byton thing will be shut down, they will just keep the plant and the [electric vehicle] platform. 
Byton sued co-founder Carsten Breitfeld late last year claiming he stole trade secrets
Breitfelds exit is, in fact, now part of a new legal dispute between the startup and its co-founder. In August 2019, Byton filed a previously unreported lawsuit against the Breitfeld accusing him of stealing and using the startups trade secrets at Iconiq, a separate Chinese EV startup that he worked following his split with Byton (and before he became CEO of Faraday Future). Byton claims Breitfeld announced his new position with Iconiq at the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2019, despite not resigning from Byton until the following month. 
The also startup alleges that Breitfeld wrongfully poached employees on his way out, that they were using and relying on Bytons confidential and trade-secret information to allow Iconiq to compete directly with Byton, and that many of the depictions and descriptions of lconiqs vehicles are remarkably similar to Bytons vehicles. 
Breitfeld has disputed much of this in court filings and contends that Bytons board of directors removed him as CEO in January 2019 before ultimately terminating him in April of that year.

 Uber has made an offer to buy food delivery company Postmates, according to a report in The New York Times. The report doesn’t say how big the deal would be, but it could be finalized as soon as tonight; discussions are said to be ongoing.
Demand for Uber’s ride-hailing business has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic as people stay at home, but the same circumstances have driven a huge increase in food delivery orders. Uber has been looking for ways to boost its food service, Uber Eats, after laying off more than a quarter of the company’s overall workforce.
Uber attempted to buy GrubHub earlier this year, but the deal fell apart amid reported antitrust scrutiny and GrubHub ended up going to European service Just Eat Takeaway for $7.3 billion. Postmates would likely be a smaller deal; it’s a private company and its last valuation was $2.4 billion. The company has already been in talks to sell itself to suitors including DoorDash and GrubHub, according to the Times.
The Verge has contacted Uber regarding the potential deal."

NASA has once again delayed the launch of its new powerful space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, mostly due to disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recently slated to fly in March of 2021, the massive telescope is now scheduled to launch on October 31st, 2021.
The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, had already predicted this delay. NASA came up with the new date after doing an extensive review to see if the March 2021 timing was actually possible. The agency attributes about three months of the delay to social distancing and other precautions that had to be put in place to keep people safe from the coronavirus. Much of the impact, of course, comes from people not being at work, right? Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, said during a press conference. Not touching the hardware or from having a reduced number of people available to do shifts. 
coronavirus isnt solely to blame
However, coronavirus isnt solely to blame. Two additional months were added to the schedule thanks to technical challenges experienced by the primary contractor, Northrop Grumman, as it pieced the telescope together and conducted testing. Northrop Grumman has already dealt with numerous technical problems during the development of the spacecraft, such as washers and screws coming loose during tests as well as accidental tears in the vehicles thin sunshield, which is designed to protect the observatory from the intense heat of the Sun. NASA then added an extra two months as schedule margin, in case other unknown problems crop up between now and launch.
The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, has been plagued with delays throughout its entire history. The observatory, first conceived in the 1990s, was projected to cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion, with a launch date somewhere between 2007 and 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. Ever since then, the cost of the project has ballooned and the launch date has been repeatedly delayed. 
In 2011, Congress replanned the entire project, creating a cap of $8 billion on the telescopes development, with a launch in 2018. But in 2018, NASA delayed the project yet again, stating that $8.8 billion was needed for the development, and that the entirety of the mission would cost $9.66 billion, including the cost of operating the telescope in space. That year, NASA set the March 2021 launch date.
NASA does not expect to exceed that budget any further, even with the new delay. Based on current projections, the program expects to complete the remaining work within the new schedule, without requiring additional funds, Gregory Robinson, the program director for James Webb, said during a press call, where we use existing program funding to stay within this $8.8 billion development cost cap.
Were not expecting to go beyond October 31st.
NASA says it has already spoken with Arianespace, the company that will launch JWST, about the delay. The company claims that the rockets intended ride, the Ariane 5, will be ready to take the vehicle to space next Halloween. NASA is also standing firm by the October 31st date. Were not expecting to go beyond October 31st, Robinson said. We have high confidence in that.
The James Webb Space Telescope is destined to be the most powerful space observatory ever built when its launched, capable of peering back in time to when the Universe first came into being 13.8 billion years ago. The telescope sports a massive gold-plated mirror, measuring 21 feet, or 6.5 meters, across, that will gather light from the distant reaches of the cosmos."

As the pandemic continues to keep people inside, some jobs have shifted from office culture to working from home. For developers adjusting to this new reality, many say theyre struggling to stay focused and productive under the new conditions, according to a new survey published by GDC. The results, released today, include almost 2,500 developers. 
Of those who responded to the survey, 70 percent say theyve switched to working from home. Workers cited specific problems around child care, communication, distractions, as well as general anxiety over larger troubles. The biggest overall team challenge has been managing ambient stress, wrote one respondent. Everyone has been affected by the pandemic in some way, even if not directly, and the general atmosphere of anxiety is impossible to ignore completely. 
Shortly after the beginning of quarantine for many US-based employees, developers who spoke with The Vergecited similar problems. While some, like developers at Bungie, quickly pivoted to setting up infrastructure for their employees to adjust to home, others struggled to generally focus. 
Although GDCs survey shows that developer jobs have been largely unaffected by COVID thus far 8 percent reported job loss due to the pandemic its harder to account for the impact on mental health. While 32 percent reported that they felt productivity had decreased at home, developers also report their creativity has somewhat decreased (28 percent) or greatly decreased (7 percent). However, that doesnt necessarily point to troubles with home itself. As one respondent put it, The overall situation (financial troubles at company level, additional meetings and overhead, anxiety going to the grocery store) is probably more to blame than staying at my home is.
anxiety going to the grocery store is probably more to blame than staying at my home is
Business appears to be have been meaningfully affected, surveyors say, with some seeing upticks in earnings even as others suffer significant business downturns. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported overall business is about the same, while another 24 percent said somewhat increased. On either end of the spectrum, 7 percent said their business has greatly increased, while another 8 percent say its greatly decreased. Roughly 33 percent of developers, or 1 in 3, say theyve had a game delayed. 
The game industry, notorious for crunch, may still need to grapple with how employees find work-life balance under these new conditions. Many developers (39 percent in total) say that theyre working longer hours than pre-pandemic. Its harder to establish limits when working from home, one wrote. You feel youre at home so its okay to do 2, 3, 4+ extra hours. The company also encourages (unpaid) crunch.
As for what the future holds, more than half of developers (64 percent) say that their companies have adopted new practices and processes that will continue once lockdown ends. For some, that means more freedom to work from home. We had to make some changes on our daily tasks to compensate not being at our office working physically together, but those have proven to increase our efficiency and productivity, wrote one developer. Lately we have even talked about embracing the home office configuration even after the pandemic."

 (The Conversation)Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses have been given unprecedented media attention for their daily, selfless sacrifices. Make no mistake: Covid-19 patients recover largely because of the nursing services they receive. Yet, hidden within the layers of care rendered by nurses are the psychological traumas they endure.
Now, as nurses are hailed as health care heroes during the pandemic, we're faced with what to do about these psychological injuries, not only for the 4 million nurses in the US the largest health care workforce in America but for the rest of us who depend on them.
For the past five years, I've examined the types of psychological trauma that nurses experience. Along with Dr. John Thompson, my co-author, I've described them in our 2019 book, prophetic as it was published six months before Covid-19 first appeared in China.
Prior to the pandemic, nurses faced ethical and personal safety dilemmas during disasters and other emergencies. They saw patients suffer, not only from illness itself, but because of health care interventions, otherwise known as medically induced trauma (think of a patient on a ventilator).
In a follow-up study after the book was published, I dug deeper, collected information from nurses, and learned of yet another type of psychological injury: insufficient resource trauma. This occurs when nurses don't have the staff, supplies, knowledge or access to other professionals to fulfill ethical or professional responsibilities. The pandemic has been a dark catalyst to seeing this urgent concern. In a survey of 32,000 nurses just completed by the American Nurses Association, 68% of nurses said they are worried about being short-staffed and 87% are very or somewhat afraid to go to work.
Demands for resources largely ignored for decades
A particularly big part of insufficient resource trauma comes from inadequate nurse staffing levels, which may lead to bad outcomes for both nurses and patients. The evidence for these outcomes, both compelling and consistent worldwide, is based on more than two decades of research. Having to forego what you know is right when there's just not enough staffing in a high-stakes environment feels like a betrayal of one's spirit. A nurse's sense of morality, of what is right and wrong, is endangered.
More recently, there has been a shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) throughout US hospitals. But I know nurses who were told by employers to take care of Covid-19 patients regardless of whether or not adequate PPE was available. Clearly this was a danger to both nurses and patients; surely this qualifies as a traumatizing experience.
Other nurses some new, some working previously in non-acute care have been deployed to critical care units. Understanding the technology of these complex environments requires a steep learning curve. The knowledge, then, to competently care for these patients may be considered an insufficient resource.
The toll on patients and nurses
Nurses, more than anything, strive to deliver high-quality care and connect with patients during their most vulnerable times. But often there isn't the time. The inability to achieve that goal causes stress. Imagine being forced to choose between giving morning meds and sitting down with a patient newly diagnosed with cancer or spending time with the family of a patient with Covid-19. Choices like that leave nurses focused on tasks and morally injured.
In my pre-pandemic study, traumatized nurses report symptoms of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder): intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, ""brain fog"" and flashbacks. They felt unsafe, isolated and dissatisfied with the profession. As nurses, they felt like failures. One former bedside nurse quit, opting instead for office work, where her ""level of trauma and stress is virtually nonexistent.""
Some traumas may be unavoidable. That happens when the nurse fully engages with the patient and co-experiences suffering. This is called secondary or vicarious trauma. That's why we need to offer trauma-informed care to both nurse and patient. Meaningful connections with others is critical, but so is psychological safety.
The pandemic has focused our attention on the mental health needs of health care providers. Nursing organizations have responded, and these efforts are to be applauded. But until we appreciate the sovereignty of nurses, who practice in a way no other health provider does, solutions to avoid trauma will be stalled. And nurses will continue to struggle.
While I haven't been at the bedside for a number of years, I still remember how it felt to report to the acute care center at the hospital, hoping no one had called in sick. When that happened, I was assigned an extra patient or two. I knew I couldn't give the care I wanted to the paraplegic young man. I knew I couldn't spend more time communicating with the older adult who had a sudden right-sided stroke. I couldn't give them the things so important to healing -- the physical care, the nursing presence and the compassion they needed and deserved.
Those experiences stay with you. It's a heck of a feeling.
Nursing care is both an art and a science; it is a distinct profession that wields enormous influence on those who need the most help. They do not merely follow instructions from other providers. It's a beautiful profession, unlike any other, founded on intellect, judgment and a caring spirit. It pushes a person to examine values such as social justice and the ethics of life, and it becomes a part of who a nurse is.
Until all of us see nursing this way and until organizations provide sufficient resources to prevent avoidable trauma, which will allow nurses to provide safe, quality care nurses will continue to suffer. More will choose to leave the profession. Particularly now, that's a loss society can't afford.

 (The Conversation)With prospects of a Covid-19 vaccine looking up, attention is also turning to the problem of anti-vax ideas. According to a recent survey, one in six Britons would refuse a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Although vaccine hesitancy is a complex problem with multiple causes, the number of conspiracy theories circulating about the coronavirus do not help.
The fight against Covid-19-related conspiracy theories will be fought on multiple fronts. It requires a broad public health campaign and for social media companies to control the spread of disinformation. But all of us can play a part in this effort. Most people will know someone who has succumbed to conspiracy theories about the current crisis.
I have been researching conspiracy theories for over two decades and have spoken to many believers. Here are the six rules I use for talking to conspiracy theorists in the effort to change their mind.
1. Acknowledge scale of the task
Talking to people who endorse conspiracy theories is inherently difficult. Simply laying out evidence or pointing out logical contradictions in the conspiracist argument is seldom enough. Conspiracy theories are, by definition, irrefutable.
Lack of evidence of a conspiracy, or positive proof against its existence, is taken by believers as evidence of the craftiness of those behind the plot, and their ability to dupe the public. So arm yourself with patience, and be prepared to fail. 
2. Recognize the emotional dimension
Conspiracy theories seduce not so much through the power of argument, but through the intensity of the passions that they stir. Underpinning conspiracy theories are feelings of resentment, indignation and disenchantment about the world. They are stories about good and evil, as much as about what is true.
This gives conspiracy theories a strong emotional dimension. Tempers can flare and conversations turn into a shouting match. It is important to prevent this from happening. Be prepared to de-escalate the situation and keep the dialogue going, without necessarily giving ground.
3. Find out what they actually believe
Before trying to persuade someone, find out the nature and content of his beliefs. When it comes to conspiracy theories, the world is not divided into ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" -- there's a lot in between.
A minority of committed believers treat conspiracy theories as the literal truth and are particularly resistant to persuasion. Many others might not see themselves as ""believers,"" but are willing to accept that conspiracy theorists might be onto something and are at least asking the right questions. Establishing the precise nature, and extent, of someone's belief, will enable you to better tailor your response.
Also, try and find out what specific conspiracy theory they endorse. Is it 5G or Bill Gates that they think is behind coronavirus? Or both? What videos or websites have they looked at? Once you find out, gather as much disconfirming evidence as you can from credible sources, including multiple independent fact-checking websites.
Background research will help you to focus the discussion on the substance of the claims. Never question someone's intelligence or moral sense, as this is the quickest way to end a conversation.
4. Establish common ground
One of the main problems with conspiracy theories is that they are not confined to tinfoil-hat-wearing kooks or political extremists. In times of crisis and uncertainty, they can contaminate the worldview of otherwise reasonable people.
Conspiracy theories make reality seem less chaotic, and tap into broader, often well-grounded concerns about the world such as the concentration of financial and political power, mass surveillance, inequality or lack of political transparency. So when talking about conspiracy theories, start by acknowledging these broader concerns and restrict your discussion to whether conspiracy theories can provide an adequate or meaningful answer.
Many people come to conspiracy theories through genuine, albeit misguided, curiosity about how to make sense of the world. They sometimes see themselves as healthy skeptics and self-taught researchers into complex issues. Avoid criticising or mocking this. Instead, present it as something that, in principle, you value and share. Your aim, after all, is not to make them less curious or skeptical, but to change what they are curious about, or skeptical of.
Conspiracy theories often sound convincing because they start with the detailed exposition of credible scientific or historical facts. The problem is that these facts and arguments lead to extraordinary conclusions.
The kernels of truth on which conspiracy theories are based are a solid starting point for a discussion. Agreement on at least some of the facts will allow you to focus on the leap of imagination that allows two and two to make five.
5. Challenge the facts, value their argument
Debunking conspiracy theories requires a two-pronged approach. The first involves challenging evidence and its origins. Address specific claims and discuss what constitutes a credible source. Offer to look at the evidence together, including on fact-checking websites.
If you are talking to a staunch believer, he probably won't even engage with you on this. But if he has not yet fallen down the rabbit hole, he might, and this may lead him to start questioning his views.
The second approach involves challenging the relevance and value of the conspiracist case more generally. You may want to point out that throughout history, conspiracy theories have come up short.
For instance, the longstanding claims by AIDS denialists that antiretroviral drugs are more harmful than HIV were not only disproven, but they contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. More recent and similarly baseless theories about the polio vaccine causing sterility directly led to the disease resurging in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afganistan.
Covid-19-related claims are in the same genre. Setting these conspiracy theories in their historical context can demonstrate that they offer nothing new, and don't ask the right questions about the pandemic and its causes. This just might encourage the person to direct their curiosity and skepticism to more worthwhile concerns.
There is, of course, no guarantee that this advice will be effective. There are no incontestable arguments or fail-proof strategies that will always convert a conspiracy theorist to skepticism. Therefore, set realistic expectations. The aim of talking to conspiracy theorists is not to convert them, but to sow doubt about an argument, and hopefully enable them to gradually build up resistance to its seductive appeal.

 (CNN)On Thursday, we hit a grim watershed. The US overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. This is a dire crisis and an extraordinary failure of President Donald Trump. Americans are suffering and dying because the Trump administration failed to act quickly and decisively to prevent the virus' spread. The US has now seen about 1,195 deaths and the number is rising rapidly. 
On Thursday, the US saw an increase of more than 15,000 cases in one day -- a shocking surge that can be explained by both the spread of the virus and increased testing after weeks of shortages -- pushing the total number of confirmed cases over 82,000. China, in comparison, has reported 81,285 cases. 
There is a fundamental difference between China and the US. China has broken the spread of the virus with a lockdown that first started in Wuhan on January 23 and is now being lifted in stages; only a few dozen new cases are allegedly confirmed each day, and most of these are apparently introduced from abroad. The US has not broken the epidemic. And if Trump has his way, easing guidelines to stay at home by Easter, we will fail to stop the epidemic and millions more will be infected. Even with active control, we might be facing around 81,000 deaths by July according to a new detailed analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The transfer of the virus, which may have originated in bats, to humans was an unforeseen event. The response to that event has been determined by the policies of nations. On December 31, the Wuhan government publicly confirmed it was treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new pneumonia outbreak and on January 7, officials identified a new coronavirus as the cause. The first confirmed case in Japan was identified in mid-January, with South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and the US following suit within days.
The East Asian countries went into action. Many had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak and had public health teams on alert for new epidemics. More than two months later, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed in the US, with more than 250 cases per million people, far higher than China, which has approximately 57 cases per million; Hong Kong, 60; Taiwan, 11; Singapore, 117; Japan, 11; and Korea, 180. 
Trump bears direct responsibility for America's unpreparedness and failed response to the epidemic. Since Trump came into office, he has systematically taken apart our protective public health system. The pandemic unit at the National Security Council was dismantled in 2018 under his watch. Trump slashed the CDC's epidemic control teams in 39 countries, including China. And when the epidemic hit, Trump ignored it, downplayed it, and made repeated false claims. Even now, he spouts vulgar nonsense about restarting the economy by Easter when public health experts say the threat is going to persist for far longer.
Trump is profoundly culpable, but he is not the only reason for America's dismal situation in the face of this epidemic. Our for-profit health care system rakes in money on disease, not on health. Instead, we have a system that works for the rich, instead of a public health system for all Americans that readily anticipates and controls new pathogens through testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. 
Americans across the country are fighting to stay alive, while Trump acts as if he is more intent on saving the economy. We can still try to control the virus as the East Asian countries are doing. We need decisive action across states and cities. We are finding leadership today in our governors, mayors and our brave frontline health workers."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)I talk about and explain things for a living. I have also been covering the coronavirus outbreak for weeks.
But when it comes to talking about all this with my own children, I've been finding myself tongue-tied.
At first, I didn't talk about it with my daughters. I have a 5 and a 2-year old, so I just made sure to remind them they needed to wash their hands more often.
But when my eldest daughter walked out of school and declared, ""Mom, there's something called 'Corona' and everyone is getting sick,"" I knew I couldn't avoid it any longer.
I then tried telling my 5-year-old ""there is a sickness"" but she didn't need to worry too much about it. That led to her asking in full voice, walking down the sidewalk, ""Does that person have the sickness?"" Then pointing at the next person and asking again, ""How about that person? Does he have the sickness?""
It quickly set in that I needed some help, expert help on how to have this conversation. I also quickly realized I'm not alone. My producer told me her 6-year-old wanted to know if he could still give her a kiss goodnight as he was concerned that he would give her the coronavirus.
As parents, we could all use a little help in this unprecedented moment. I started with the person I always go to first when it comes to the health and well-being of my children -- our pediatrician. ""The fewer words, the better always,"" Dr. Bruce Brovender of Global Pediatrics advised. ""But always be honest."" 
If you're not, he said, ""You actually make things scarier and more traumatic because they don't know what the truth is and what [it] is not.""
Brovender's guidance motivated me to dig deeper. And after spending hours on the phone with doctors, experts and clinicians, I've found some helpful common threads of the dos and don'ts when talking to our little ones about something so big.
 Be reassuring but be honest
""The most important thing across ages is that children need to know that they're going to be OK and chances are their parents are going to be OK,"" says Tovah Klein, director of the Barnard Center for Toddler Development at Columbia University. ""The first thing is to reassure them about that.""
""It's a balance between addressing children's worry and fears, because that is real, and reassuring them because the truth is most people do get better from this.""
Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, adds that comes with the balance that this can't be treated like any other day. ""It's really critical that people understand that it's not like a snow day. We need to not have play dates. We need to not have the birthday parties; we need to postpone those until we have a clearer picture of what's going on with this.""
And in explaining these abrupt changes to children, it's important to remind them ""the grown-ups are handling it,"" says clinical psychologist Rebecca Schrag Hershberg. ""We don't have to pretend we know all the answers, but we do have to project a calm confidence that there are smart people everywhere -- doctors, policymakers, teachers -- all working together to make sure we get through this.""
""Children are hearing a tremendous amount. They're hearing big words that they've never heard before, none of us have really,"" says Klein. ""Even the terms coronavirus and Covid-19, it's like what's that?
""I've been telling parents that it's really important that the parent is the filter of the information,"" Klein adds. For older children that may be addressing misinformation they hear from friends or on social media. For younger children that may just start with demystifying terms, like answering ""what is coronavirus?"" The answer Klein suggests: ""It's a really big word but it's a fancy word for what we normally call a cold or the flu and something that's been around for a long time. Now there's a new virus and that's what everyone is talking about.""
Hershberg agrees that transparency is key. ""I think transparency for kids, even little kids, is more comforting than the alternative when they notice that there's a huge elephant in the room, but they also notice no one is talking about it."" 
""Listen first and talk second. Listen for concerns, questions and misinformation while you are enjoying usual play with your children -- whether that is drawing, dolls, or throwing a ball. Then let kids know you're glad they are asking you questions and sharing what is on their mind,"" says Dr. Joshua Morganstein, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Psychiatric Dimensions on Disasters. ""Young children need fewer words, and they'll be reassured and comforted by a calm parent.""
Hershberg adds that it's a good practice to avoid the tendency to want to fill the silence when it comes to these types of sensitive conversations with your kids. ""If they ask a question, you answer their questions in a direct, clear and brief way and then pause and see if they have any more questions. Pause and see what happens next."" 
How to say, 'I don't know'
It's OK to say ""I don't know,"" experts agree. ""In fact, it's important to do so,"" says Morganstein. ""When children find out you misled them, it will undermine their trust in you.""
But it appears there are more helpful ways to say, ""I don't know"" than just saying ""I don't know."" There is, ""I don't know. Why don't we look that up together,"" says Morganstein. This allows you to model for the child that when you don't know something, you seek out information about it. ""This can really enhance a sense of trust that a child has in you, knowing that you can count on your parents to tell you what they know, tell you want they don't know and then go find out the answer.""
""You can say, I need to think about that,"" says Hershberg, helping play out another ""I don't know"" scenario. ""Saying I don't know in a calm and puzzled voice, not in panicked and worried voice, is not uncomfortable for our kids unless we make it uncomfortable."" 
""Kids can feel really comforted when you say 'you know there are so many people asking that exact question at this exact moment. We are in a community of a whole world of people, all asking that question.'""
This is all about how to talk to our children about Covid-19. And so, I was perhaps most surprised about how many of these experts emphasized the impact of our own stress and anxiety levels on how our children are handling and processing this uncertain time.
""It's overwhelming for parents right now because this is such a fluid situation. Every day, even every half day it's a new thing going on with Covid-19,"" Goza told me. ""So, it's overwhelming for parents and it's really frightening for kids.""
But it starts with us not making matters worse for our kids. ""First, check your own stress level. If you (or other adults around them) are behaving in a highly stressed manner, your children may simply be picking up on and emulating this behavior,"" says Morganstein. 
""Don't talk to your kids about any of this stuff when you're in a moment of anxiety,"" adds Hershberg. ""If you hear something or read a tweet that makes you really anxious, it's OK to say to your child, 'before I'm going to answer that question, I'm actually feeling a little bit worried right now so I'm going to take my three deep breaths, do you want to do that with me?'""
And an important reminder, that kids of different ages will express their anxiety in these anxiety-inducing times in very different ways.
""Overall, it's important to remember that distress looks different in kids and in children at different ages. Isolation, diminished academic performance or aggression may be seen in older children. Irritability, lethargy or return to earlier age behaviors can be seen in young children. For parents who are understandably distracted and already feeling heightened stress themselves, this can be easily misinterpreted as 'misbehavior',"" says Morganstein.
When we are all feeling pretty helpless, let's be honest, it can help children through these moments by giving them some of the power back. That can be helpful when explaining why they have to wash their hands so much, why they can't play with their friends like they normally do and it can be especially helpful with questions about grandparents and the elderly.
""Empower children by saying, look we don't get very sick [from the coronavirus] but believe it or not we could still have that virus, we have to help so that not too many people get sick. That's part of our job,"" suggested Klein.
""That also explains the hand washing -- 'that keeps the germs away and the virus away.'
""That explains school closing -- 'we're trying to really keep this virus from spreading so you're not going to be with so many other people. That's why mommy or daddy has to work from home now.' All of those pieces can be put in the context of we're all working together.""
Hershberg reminds us that children often process difficult events through play, so empower them to do that. ""Cast a magic spell on the virus... Pretending to be Elsa and freezing the virus. Those are all things that will help kids feel powerful and also let them process the feelings.""
So, let them play out the feelings, whatever they are. ""It's healthy and means they feel safe talking about it,"" says Hershberg.
Giving that sense of empowerment to older children understandably requires a different approach. ""There's going to be a lot of sadness about missing sports events, proms and a lot of things, and I just think we have to give them that reassurance,"" says Goza. ""The more we do now to make this pandemic be as short as we can...then the sooner they'll be able to get out and do those things.""
""You can be the germ destroyers or germ busters,"" says Klein. ""Making it light and fun. Not making it so serious that is scares the children.""
Hershberg agrees saying, ""Your family [are] superheroes fighting the virus and every time you wash hands, you are taking a step to keep people healthy and safe,"" she suggests. ""You are emphasizing that this is an active choice and that we are all joining together to do it. And not that we're all just helpless in our houses waiting to hear what's going on.""
While no one can say for sure when this crisis will end, this expert advice gives me a great place to start when it's time for more tough conversations in the days ahead -- when the girls and I aren't playing Super Germ Busters."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)A college friend who is now a physician first introduced me to an electronic cigarette in 2008. He purchased his online from China with the hope of transitioning from smoking to vaping but found himself using both instead. A few years later, he shared a pleasant surprise -- he had succeeded in quitting both vaping and smoking. 
The breakthrough came one winter while he was recovering from a cold. As he reached for the e-cigarette, he realized the hazard of exposing his recovering lungs to a cloud of smoke. He gave his e-cigarette away, and never vaped or smoked again. His success story highlights the power of a second event to break the nicotine addiction. The current Covid-19 pandemic may serve as a similar warning call to smokers and vapers to stop promptly.
Over the past 10 months, three serial waves of severe acute respiratory illnesses have strained the American emergency care delivery system from 1) e-cigarette, or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI), 2) the influenza season, and 3) Covid-19. Around June 2019, US hospitals first noted a rise in respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked this EVALI outbreak into early 2020, ultimately counting 2,807 hospitalized patients in all 50 US states, with 68 deaths as of February. Overlapping with the EVALI crisis has been the influenza season, which runs from October through May. So far, the CDC estimated there have been at least 39 million US cases of the flu, leading to 400,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 deaths. The third stress has been the worldwide pandemic of Covid-19, totaling, at the time of writing, 337,933 cases in the US and 9,653 deaths. 
Smoking has many negative effects on respiratory health, and the possibility of a relationship between smoking (both traditional cigarettes and marijuana) or vaping with Covid-19 were raised by early observations in China. One report, looking at 1,099 laboratory confirmed cases in China, revealed that 12.4% of smokers either died, required ICU admission or needed intubation, compared to 4.7% among never smokers. Another study found that among Chinese patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, the odds of disease progression (including death) were an order of magnitude higher among smokers compared to non-smokers. The World Health Organization has noted that cigarette smokers are likely to have more serious illness if infected with Covid-19.
The FDA has advised that cigarette smoking and vaping may leave users with underlying health conditions and increase the risk of coronavirus pneumonia and increase its severity. Further research should be undertaken to determine the extent. The US Surgeon General has reported that smoking is strongly linked to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and coronary artery disease, all of which impair the immune response and the ability to fight Covid-19. 
Active research is ongoing to assess the long-term health risks of marijuana use and vaping, including pediatric chronic bronchitis. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio highlighted a possible connection between the coronavirus and vaping after noting a healthy 22-year-old New York City man, whose only risk factor appeared to be a history of vaping, was hospitalized for Covid-19. The CDC has reported that up to 20% of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in the US are between ages 20 and 44, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom noted that half of the Covid-19 cases in California are in younger adults aged 18 to 49. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speculated that the popularity of vaping might explain the increased incidence of Covid-19 among youth and young adults, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse has included vapers on the list of groups who could be most impacted by Covid-19.
A related question is whether previous vaping-related lung injuries may predispose to a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. EVALI patients who survived may develop long term respiratory issues. If they were to contract Covid-19, they might also be at greater risk for respiratory failure, prolonged intubation and mortality. 
As they recover from the coronavirus, smokers and vapers should make every effort to stop to protect their lung health. Repeatedly inhaling from an e-cigarette (possibly coated with viruses or bacteria) violates the principle of minimizing contact with one's mouth and face to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19. Sharing an e-cigarette with others only increases that risk further. While the cigarette butt is discarded after each use, e-cigarette devices are used repeatedly. Perhaps e-cigarettes should be designed to be disposable, to minimize the risk of infection transmission. Another area to study further is whether the plume of vaping aerosol generated might deposit virus particles on surfaces in the environment. 
The majority of cases from the EVALI outbreak were associated with vaping of marijuana/THC contaminated with vitamin E acetate. But the CDC did not exclude that other causes might exist, as 14% of the EVALI patients ""exclusively used nicotine-containing products.""
Perhaps some of the mysterious EVALI cases from the winter of 2019 should now be re-analyzed, to determine if the coronavirus may have played a role. Bronchoscopy biopsies and lung specimens stored in pathology labs across America could be assessed to see if coronavirus RNA is present. Similarly, reanalyzing influenza cases from the winter may reveal if the current cases of infection we are witnessing are actually a second wave.
The initial impact of Covid-19 on the e-cigarette industry was an interruption of the supply chain. About 90% of the world's e-cigarette hardware is produced in China, and many factories in Shenzhen were closed during the coronavirus outbreak there. More recently, many vape shops across America have closed, having been defined as non-essential services. This likely made it more difficult for youth to acquire vaping devices from peers or older siblings, or at school. Another unintended benefit of mandatory school closures has been the opportunity for parents to monitor, and have conversations with their children while they are at home to curb youth vaping.
Given the adverse effect on respiratory health, the current coronavirus pandemic should serve as a message to both smokers and vapers to quit promptly and take immediate action to reduce their risks of viral transmission. 
And if doing so immediately seems like too big of a task, at the very least, other measures like regularly sanitizing e-cigarettes and cannabis smoking devices should be taken.
Smokers and vapers should also be more mindful of the secondhand smoke and clouds generated, avoid generating large clouds in public from vape tricks, and follow clean indoor air laws. Social distancing could be extended to the vapor generated to maintain a 6-foot distance from others when in public spaces, or to smoke and vape only in confined spaces. Active research is ongoing but difficult to conduct while simultaneously treating a pandemic, and many questions about the risks to smokers and vapers and those around them will be answered over time. 
Ultimately, Covid-19 presents a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate our nation towards the dual goals of smoking and vaping cessation."

Later that day, editorial board members of The Observer -- the student newspaper covering Notre Dame, as well as neighboring Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross College -- held an emergency Zoom meeting. They discussed the school's announcement and the option of temporary remote learning versus going virtual for the entire semester.
An editor spoke up: ""I've been thinking about this for a while,"" the editor said. ""About what we're going to do when they make us write obituaries.""
That's how the idea was born. On Friday, The Observer's front page highlighted this plea: ""Don't make us write obituaries.""
""We wanted to make the messaging clear that we all have a role to play in keeping the tri-campus community safe,"" editor-in-chief Maria Leontaras, a senior at St. Mary's, told CNN. ""There are more people here than just young students who could possibly recover from the virus.""
In the editorial, the board asked everyone -- students, the administration and faculty -- to do everything in their power to contain the virus. 
""The University administration has largely blamed the COVID-19 outbreak on students attending off-campus parties,"" the editorial said. ""While this isn't entirely misplaced, it has been used to deflect responsibility from the very administrations that insisted they were prepared for us to return to campus.""
If more isn't done, the editorial said, the worst may be still to come.
""The blame for this does not lie with just one party. We -- as students, faculty, staff and administrators -- need to share responsibility for the outbreak on our hands,"" the editorial said.
Notre Dame announced Tuesday that if its efforts to contain the coronavirus don't work, the school will shift to remote learning for the rest of the semester. 
The school has seen more than 300 confirmed cases of the virus since the beginning of the month. In Tuesday's video announcement to students, university president Rev. John I. Jenkins called the spike ""very serious.""
""For your sake, the sake of our community, and for continuing our semester on campus, please observe health protocols,"" he said. ""Avoid behavior that puts yourself or others at risk.""
But Leontaras said she and other editors would like to see more transparency from the university, like how many students are in quarantine, for example. 
Colleges and universities across the United States are dealing with similar problems as they reopen, with some seeing hundreds of coronavirus cases in just a week or two of classes. 
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill canceled in-person classes after just one week, after cases ballooned. University employees have filed a class action lawsuit against the UNC System, alleging unsafe workplace conditions because of Covid-19. 
The Observer's editorial, meanwhile, ended on a sober note. Don't let us write obituaries, it said, but also: ""Don't let us write yours."""

Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said during a telebriefing with journalists that the trials will take place in several countries around the globe. 
""We're going to do clinical trials not just in Russia but also the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, probably in Brazil or in India,"" Dmitriev said. He also said that a delegation from the Saudi Ministry of Health would be traveling to Moscow next week. 
Experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine, named Sputnik V, was registered and how few details about the research have been released. 
Dmitriev said on Thursday that Russia would try to answer Western criticism over the lack of information about its vaccine candidate by publishing a detailed science paper in a ""major publication"" in August. He declined to name the publication where the study would publish.
He also refused to give an exact number for how many people have tested the vaccine already.
So far, Russia hasn't released any scientific data on its testing and CNN is unable to verify the vaccine's claims of safety or effectiveness. 
The forthcoming clinical trials are to assess the ""epidemic efficacy"" of the vaccine, Denis Logunov, deputy director for scientific work at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, who is developing the Russian Covid-19 vaccine candidate, said on Thursday. 
Alexander Ginsburg, director of Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, described on Thursday how the vaccine is given in two doses and involves using uses a different adenovirus for each of the two doses. 
Dmitriev said that ""Russia is open to international cooperation"" and ""we do believe that there will be other vaccines coming up and the more vaccines we get the better."" 
There are now 30 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO list classifies the Russian vaccine as being in Phase 1 trials.

The latest cluster, defined as five or more cases in close proximity, was traced to the Hinton James residence hall, UNC said Sunday. The individuals in the cluster have been identified. They are isolating and receiving medical monitoring, the university said.
On Saturday, UNC announced a cluster of coronavirus cases at the Sigma Nu fraternity. And on Friday, the university identified a cluster at the Ehringhaus Community, a residence hall, and at the Granville Towers, a private apartment complex that serves as a housing option for some students.
The clusters illustrate the challenges of reopening schools and bringing people into close proximity while Covid-19 continues to spread widely through the state and country. North Carolina has a seven-day average of about 1,200 new coronavirus cases per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Young people generally have less severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection, but they are not immune to the virus and can spread it to others.

Once production is fully ramped up, the company expects to print up to 3,000 parts per day.
“Formlabs’ EUA for BiPAP adapters signifies the need for these components and 3D printings' unique ability to fill that need. 3D printing enables rapid iteration and prototyping of new, innovative medical equipment, while expediting the production process, shortening supply chains, and allowing for localized manufacturing,” said Max Lobovsky, Formlabs CEO and co-founder.
Lobovsky noted that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA had only authorized a handful of EUAs. In March, Abbott received the rush-approval for its toaster-sized lab-in-a-box, and recently, NASA’s ventilator design was approved through the fast-track authorization.
While companies from Tesla to Dyson and NVIDIA have explored new ways to manufacture ventilators, pivoting manufacturing to make the devices is difficult and requires a lot of expertise. Plus, all ventilators have to clear regulatory hurdles and require creating new supply chains. Solutions like Formlabs’ adapter and right-to-repair efforts to prolong the life of existing equipment may be more practical."

The press release was light on specifics on how it'll actually work, but the point is clear: For the first time since 1967, there won't be a CES as we know it in Las Vegas or anywhere else.
Again, we still don't know exactly how the new digital CES will work for exhibitors and press. More than 170,000 people attended the last one in January, so there are plenty of mouths to feed as CES moves to an entirely virtual presentation.

This development shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, even though CES waited until now to drop the charade that the 2021 show would happen as previously scheduled. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there were actually some concerns that CES may have helped spread the disease. Now, given the disastrous rise of case and death numbers in the U.S. since then, it's no wonder that people don't want to congregate in crowded conference halls and casinos in just a few months.
Don't worry, we'll still have plenty of coverage of all the latest weird TVs, internet-connected refrigerators, and brain-scanning toilets here at Mashable. We'll just learn about them over video calls instead of at the Las Vegas Convention Center."

But dozens of workers had to report to the companys automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factorys employees. 
This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insiderand Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.
The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these end of line workers that theyd have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week. 
The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order
A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it conducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance with the shelter-in-place order. Their vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures, they said.
Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldnt receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the companys guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.
The current factory worker said Teslas end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with moderate issues. But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be work in progress, which, therefore, required more end of line work. 
Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19. 
Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible. 
Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US
At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open. 
The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to basic operations like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.
Its currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Teslas environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees had been working from home for nearly two weeks before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their direct coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms. Both employees are quarantined at home and recovering well, Shelby wrote. 
Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory as soon as humanly possible as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.

Amy is also a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and recently came out with a book called The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity. The Future Today Institute recently published the 2020 Tech Trends Report, which is a quantitative look at the big trends that will dominate the future. Nilay and Amy discuss the different paths the report takes on predicting that, with the state of technology use today, there’s no future in which we are not being scored. Amy and Nilay also discuss whether we could have predicted the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, as well as how possible it is to predict a solution and a timeline for that solution right now. Below is an excerpt of the conversation edited for clarity. Nilay Patel: We’re in the middle of a pandemic. It’s here, it’s happening. It feels like no one knows what’s going to happen next, or is this something that you’re able to model or understand? Amy Webb : So I don’t want to get too nerdy here, but if you have a discrete set of data — like Johns Hopkins [University] has discrete datasets now going back to December because we’ve seen corona outbreaks in a couple of areas around the world that have lasted a little longer than what we’re seeing in the US. So given what we know to be true, and the data that they have access to, and all of the other variables over which they would have some kind of control — like whether or not we take aggressive measures in the United States today, whether or not we somehow have a whole bunch of tests, things like that. If you look at historic data trends and then all the stuff that over which we have control, you could predict a handful of plausible outcomes that tell us a little bit more about how many people could get sick at what rate and what the mortality could look like. But most of the time, we’re talking about areas of life over which we don’t have complete control. There’s no way to have total control because there’s too many variables at play. And at that point, the math doesn’t work. You can have the most powerful computers in the world, but the computations don’t work out. You would need a continual stream of data that’s really comprehensive and evolutionary algorithms in order to make sense of it all. So we’re feeling huge amounts of anxiety about coronavirus, about the oil prices tanking. I liken this to that sense of out of controlness, if you’ve ever driven on a slippery road. If you’re driving and you hit an icy patch, most people, their instinct is to slam on the brakes. And why do we slam on the brakes? Because the act of slamming on the brakes makes us feel like we have control again. And the reason we feel like we have control is because we think we know what the future is going to be. If we slam on the brakes, the car will stop, we will be fine. That would work if you were in charge of every single variable at that moment in time, but you’re not. So slamming on the brakes and really, really, really hoping things don’t change from where they are right now or that they’re going to be like they used to be is a really great way to set yourself up not only for a crash — because that’s how you really lose control of a car — but it’s also a good way to set yourself up for disappointment. And that kind of thing has — when we extrapolate that to society — has reverberating effects. So right now what I’m observing is sort of a feverish corporate anxiety. I’m seeing governmental anxiety, and companies, just like people, have limbic systems. What do you mean by a limbic system? So it’s the fight or flight part of our bodies that evolution bestowed upon us millennia ago so that we didn’t get eaten by tigers or whatever. And we’re hearing people talk a lot about their sort of crushing anxiety, and I get that. I’m going to be the first person to tell you if you gave me all the data in the world and all the computers in the world, at this moment in time I cannot tell you what things are going to look like in three months. And that’s fine because that tells us we still have some agency. Futurists are trained to think through plausible outcomes, not so that we can accurately predict what’s next, because that’s not our goal right now. Our goal is not predictions. It’s being prepared for what comes next. And that’s good news. The good news is if you are willing to lean into uncertainty and to accept the fact that you can’t control everything, but also you are not helpless in whatever comes next. If you’re willing to adopt — and anybody can do this, it costs no money. It’s just a different perspective. If you’re willing to think more like a futurist, which is to say confront your cherished beliefs, lean into uncertainty, and be nimble with how you think, you’re going to get through this. The challenge is that I’m seeing the sort of corporate anxiety which, once you get on a cycle of that, is hard to stop. Companies start making weird decisions or they slam on their brakes. I mean, we’ve seen a bunch of that over the past couple of weeks. This is as much an opportunity to identify risk as it is to think through where are effective measures that we could be taking to not just help out everybody else but help our bottom line. There’s a lot of opportunity here. I mentioned this to you guys earlier: I’m politically independent, but I’m a pragmatist, and my greatest fear right now is that the Trump administration are nowists. They are not futurists. They think only about what’s good for them right now. They are absolutely unwilling to think long term and they are absolutely unwilling to make short-term sacrifices. In the past, that has resulted in entertaining tweet storms, that has resulted in irritations. This time around, it’s going to result in people dying. And we have to be willing to confront the fact now that, without being alarmist, without being emotional, we just have to be willing to confront alternative futures. We have to right now be willing to accept uncertainty and to think the unthinkable. And right now, that means accepting the possibility that by the end of the summer 2 million Americans could die. And if that’s a plausible future state, then how do we work backward to create a better outcome? In New York, stuff is shut down for a couple of weeks. In some ways that’s going to help flatten the curve as people are now saying. But that’s a short-term solution that doesn’t address a longer-term issue. And the real problem here is a psychological one because we’re going to get to the end of those two weeks and I think people are going to feel as though the virus should be gone and it’s not going to be. So we have an opportunity now — individually, collectively — to start mapping out alternative futures. They don’t all have to be dystopian. There are lots of really awesome things that could also happen as a result of this. For example, we’re starting to see huge investments in synthetic biology and new ways of using AI as a way to speed scientific discovery. That’s amazing because on the end of this, we could wind up with precision medication, we could wind up with synthetic agriculture as a way to mitigate climate change. There are going to be some good things on the other end of it. And now is the time to start thinking through “where is there risk, where is there opportunity, and how can we start modeling alternative futures?”"

It’s understandable since fever is an extremely common symptom of the disease.

Before you schedule a telehealth visit with your doctor, know this: there’s nothing “normal” about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That number came from a 19th century German researcher named Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich who conducted a painstaking study of patient body temperatures and arrived at a mean of 98.6. It’s an impressive bit of clinical work, but it’s sorely in need of an update. So what does pass for “normal” these days?

Apple and Google announced a system for tracking the spread of the new coronavirus, allowing users to share data through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions and approved apps from health organizations.
The new system, which is laid out in a series of white papers, would use short-range Bluetooth communications to establish a voluntary contact-tracing network, keeping extensive data on phones that have been in close proximity with each other. Official apps from public health authorities will get access to this data, and users who download them can report if theyve been been diagnosed with COVID-19. The system will also alert people who download them to whether in close contact with an infected person.
Apple and Google will introduce a pair of iOS and Android APIs in mid-May and make sure these health authorities apps can implement them. In the months after those are complete, the companies will work on building tracing functionality into the underlying operating system, then let users decide whether to share information with a wider range of apps.
Contact tracing is one of the most promising solutions for containing COVID-19, but it also raises massive privacy concerns. Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concern about tracking users with phone data, arguing that any system would need to be limited in scope and avoid compromising user privacy.
Unlike some other tracking methods like, say, using GPS data this Bluetooth plan wouldnt track peoples physical location. It would basically pick up the signals of nearby phones at 5-minute intervals and store the connections between them in a database. If one person tests positive for the novel coronavirus, they could tell the app theyve been infected, and it could notify other people whose phones passed within close range in the preceding days.
The method still has potential weaknesses. In crowded areas, it could flag people in adjacent rooms who arent actually sharing space with the user, making people worry unnecessarily Its also a relatively new program, and Apple and Google are still talking to public health authorities and other stakeholders about how to run it.

Over the weekend, a man in North Dakota was arrested for coughing at a local Walmart. The store, like all Walmart stores, was limiting the number of people allowed in at once. The man apparently wasnt happy to hear that, and intentionally coughed on store employees, the police chief said.
He joins agrowing listofpeople arrested in the US for intentionallycoughing in public in the past few weeks, as the accelerating outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in states around the country put people on edge, alert for the slightest sign that they could be exposed to the illness. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and spreads through tiny droplets of saliva produced when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or breathes. 
Those people arent being arrested under coronavirus-specific laws, says Lindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University Washington College of Law. Men in North Dakota and New Jersey, for example, were charged with terroristic threats, or threatening to cause physical harm or violence to someone. Prosecuting them for coronavirus-specific physical harmwould be much harder.
You would have to show person who did thecoughing was infectious, and was capable of transmitting the disease, Wiley says. Since testing is so limited now, its a hard case to make: the cougher would have to know they were infected for someone to prove they intentionally spread the virus. The coronavirus is also so widespread that if someone who had been coughed upon got sick, itd be hard to prove exactly where they got it from it could have been from anywhere.
Creating or jerry-rigging laws to punish people for specifically spreading COVID-19 is technically possible, and people may feel like those who dont take the virus seriously or who give it to others should be punished. But turning someone who passes on a disease into a criminal doesnt keep a community safer, Wiley says. 
Public health experts have seen that ineffectiveness play out with other viruses. There are alreadycriminal laws in dozens of states that punish people with HIV who engage in activities that may put others at risk of contracting the virus even activities that pose an extremely low risk of spreading HIV, like oral sex. Theres no evidence that criminalizing those types of activities is effective as a disease control strategy, Wiley says. The type of person who would actually, intentionally give someone else a disease isnt dissuaded by a criminal law, she says.
What it does is have a big effect on people who would never intentionally spread disease, because its a chilling effect on getting tested, she says. Its not going to help with those tiny number of people who would do that, and it might cause problems in efforts to reach people who are well-intentioned. People may be reluctant to get tested or tell people that theyre sick with a virus if theyre afraid of getting arrested, which can hinder public health efforts. Vulnerable or low-income people, who arent able to avoid the type of contact with others that could pass on the novel coronavirus because they work a service job, for example would be more likely to be affected by these laws. That would add another layer to existing inequities that are being made worse by the disease. 
In most states, legislators would have to create a new law specific to COVID-19 if they were considering treating it the same way some do HIV. Logically, creating coronavirus laws would be more difficult than HIV laws because this disease is much harder to trace than something thats sexually transmitted. 
I could see some city council member deciding [they]want to be seen as taking tough action here, Wiley says, despite the fact that theres evidence that these types of laws do more harm than good. I would hope that lawmakers wouldnt waste their time."

Nearly everyone in the US will be affected in some way by the COVID-19 pandemic, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus by stress and anxiety, event closures, or the illness itself. Theres cause for concern: the disease can be deadly, and the outbreak in the US is likely to continue to get worse. 
Theres still a lot that scientists and doctors dont know about the new coronavirus and the illness it causes. With three months of data, though, it appears that around 80 percent of people who are infected have a mild or moderate illness, around 15 percent have severe disease (which requires hospitalization), and around 5 percent are critical (and go into respiratory or organ failure). Around 3 percent of people with confirmed cases of the infection in China died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Different groups of people, though, are more likely to fall into the severe or critical categories than others:
The elderly: People who are over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19, according to data collected by the WHO. The highest death rate is in people above the age of 80. Around 15 percent of people in that age group died from the disease in one set of Chinese patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who are older stay away from crowds and avoid nonessential travel.
Children: Children, on the other hand, dont appear to get as sick. Very few develop the disease in the first place, and if they do, only a small group develop severe or critical disease. No young children have died from the virus in China. 
Researchers are still trying to figure out why thats the case. It may be that childrens lungs are less susceptible to infection or that their immune systems are stronger. Children might carry the virus around, though, and pass it between each other and then to their parents and caregivers. Thats why kids should still wash their hands as much as adults. Its also one of the reasons why areas where the virus is spreading are closing down schools. 
People with chronic conditions: People who have underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, or diabetes are also more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19. Around 9 percent of people with diabetes who contracted the virus died, for example, as did around 8 percent of people with high blood pressure. The CDC also recommends that people in this group avoid crowds, stick close to home, and stock up on medication for their condition if theyre able to. 
Everyone else: Most people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus dont get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you dont get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk and pass the virus to them. Thats why its so important to stay home if youre not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but its the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. Its the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves. 
Not everyone can work from home, stop taking public transportation, or skip large gatherings, though. If you can do those things even though they may seem silly and even if there have not been many cases identified in your area you can help blunt the impact of the pandemic.

AT&amp;T is the latest enormous company to instruct its employees to start working from home if they havent already. The work-from-home edict does not apply to AT&amp;Ts retail employees, equipment installers, and CNNs TV talent and production staff, according to CNN. But AT&amp;Ts massive corporate workforce (including those at WarnerMedia) are being asked to work from home for the time being as long as their role allows for it. 
We are committed to helping limit the spread of the virus and risk of exposure, WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey said in an internal memo. We can help minimize stress on the resources and infrastructures around us by doing our part to reduce population density in our commutes and daily activities, in efforts to help reduce spread of the virus. AT&amp;T has over 245,000 employees, according to CNN. 
It now joins other large companies in shifting to at-home work as health officials and cities encourage social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19. In support of our colleagues who need to continue working in our offices, we need to help reduce population density and risk of exposure in those locations by minimizing the on-site staff, Stankey said. 
CNN boss Jeff Zucker said its unclear how long this guidance will remain in effect in a memo to employees, but said everyone should assume that it may be long term. We encourage you to use today to make sure you are completely prepared for remote working, Zucker said.
Theres no avoiding office work for many roles at CNN, however, just as AT&amp;Ts wireless employees will still need to keep the companys stores operating smoothly. CEO Randall Stephenson said AT&amp;T is taking precautions to help workers stay safe in the days and weeks ahead if they do need to leave home. 
I realize that many of you are directly serving and interacting with our customers and that work cant be done from home, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a message that went out to employees. What you do is vital to a highly connected society like ours. And it is even more critical in times like these. So, we will be taking additional safeguards and implementing new procedures and policies to help protect you from the virus.

Googles sister company Verily has launched a screening website for people who want to get tested for COVID-19. However, Verilys website is very limited in scope: its only available to people in the Bay Area of California and its more of a pilot program than a public health utility.
In fact, its even more limited than that: in order to qualify you must be 18 years of age or older, be able to speak English, and be a US resident. It very much looks like the program a Verily spokesperson described to us on the phone on Friday and not the expansive triage system that the Trump administration promised.
The new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: 
The initial question on Verilys site asks Are you currently experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms? If you answer yes, you are told that the program is not the right fit and to seek medical attention. Reached for comment on this issue, a Verily spokesperson said that:
This screener was developed in partnership with government health officials. The initial question is meant to ensure that anyone who is seriously ill does not come to our sites because they are not prepared to provide medical attention. We are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help us refine this COVID-9 risk screening and testing.
If you answer no, youre asked to sign in with a Google account and sign an Informed Consent authorization form. It details that your data may be shared with public health officials. 
After that, you are led through a series of screener questions about your symptoms:
The actual screener asks questions about travel and work responsibilities. And it re-asks questions specifically about each symptom. Theres a few more additional questions but it took about 3 mins to read and respond. pic.twitter.com/t0M8GzIP4l
 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 16, 2020
In a blog post on Sunday, Verily said that it was working closely with the state of California on the pilot program. It did not make any promises about expanding the program beyond the state of California:
Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase. The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsoms office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks.
Verilys site is located at Project Baseline, which to date has only been used to connect people up with potential clinical trials. That infrastructure for collecting and protecting health data was one of the reasons that Verilys screening site was put on Project Baseline. The site also claims that any information you provide wont be shared with your insurance company or connected to your Google account though a Google account is necessary to use the site. 
A screenshot from Verilys new site
The website launched after a weekend of confused and inaccurate statements from the White House about a website it claimed Google is building. Google had not expected to be mentioned in Fridays press conference, according to Wired. And so it initially had not planned to build such a site, Axios reported, but began to scramble after Trumps statements. Over the course of the weekend, Google itself did not correct the record but instead issued a series of tweets pointing to Verilys sites and to its own efforts to provide information on the coronavirus. 
Earlier on Sunday, President Trump held up a printout of those tweets from the Google Comms account and claimed that they substantiated his original statements on Friday. Googles tweets did not, but they also carefully avoided directly contradicting the president. Google itself has not announced a screening website for COVID-19. 
Google has instead said it will launch an informational website, according to this post from CEO Sundar Pichai:
This includes best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses. Well be rolling out an initial version of the website late Monday, March 16, and well continue to enhance and update it with more resources on an ongoing basis.
That more comprehensive site may yet come, as Vice President Mike Pence again promised in Sundays press conference that such a site could be made, and he made a point to say that the administration was also working with other tech companies. It is not clear what that work looks like, or if those tech companies were approached before the scramble over the weekend.
Whats clear right now is that Verilys website as it currently exists is a pilot program limited in scope and availability. Whats even clearer is that the administration has not yet provided full details to US citizens on when and how they will be able to gain access to a coronavirus test, though it is clearly rushing to find a way to do so."

Google plans to add a Zoom-like gallery view to its business- and education-focused Meet videoconferencing service and let users take calls right from Gmail, Googles GM and VP of G Suite Javier Soltero told Reuters in an interview. The additions come amid huge growth for Meet as families, students, and workers use the service while at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The upcoming gallery view will let users display up to 16 meeting participants in one frame, according to Reuters. That functionality is coming later this month, said Soltero. Zooms gallery view, by contrast, lets you see the thumbnails of up to 49 people in one screen, if you have a powerful enough CPU to display them all.
Meets new integration with Gmail sounds similar to starting a video call with Hangouts
Meets new integration with Gmail sounds as if it will let Meet users start or answer a call right from their Gmail window, similar to how you can start or answer calls using Hangouts, Googles consumer-focused chat and videoconferencing app, in Gmail. The feature will begin rolling out for G Suite customers today on the web and to mobile at a later date, Google tells The Verge. 
With more and more people working and learning from home, we want to make it easier for you to connect and keep things moving forward, Google said in a statement to The Verge. With Meet in Gmail, you can easily start or join a meeting in seconds. Our goal is to help you follow the flow of the day, seamlessly switching between email and video meetings whichever form of communication you need.
Google is also adding the ability for Meet to improve video quality when you have dim lighting conditions and to filter out background noise while youre on a call, according to Reuters. Those features will also be added later this month, Reuters reports.
Google said last week that Meet was adding more than 2 million users per day. Meet has added more daily users than any other Google service since January, according to Reuters. A recent peak in Meet growth added 60 percent more users than the day before, Soltero told Reuters.
Last Thursday, Google extended free access to some advanced Meet features until September 30th previously, that free access was scheduled to end on July 1st.

Bill Gates is now the favorite target for coronavirus misinformation according to data compiled by the New York Times and Zignal Labs, a company that analyzes media sources. Conspiracy theories conflating Gates with the virus were mentioned 1.2 million times on TV and social media from February to April, 33 percent more often than the 2nd most popular conspiracy theory linking 5G with COVID-19, according to Zignal Labs, peaking at 18,000 mentions a day in April.
Hoaxes directed at the Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist, are all over YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. The New York Times found 16,000 posts on Facebook this year that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times. The 10 most popular Youtube videos spreading misinformation about Gates and the virus were viewed almost five millions times in March and April. The falsehoods being spread vary, but range from him creating COVID-19 in order to profit from a vaccine, or of Gates being a member of a plot to cull humanity or implementing a global surveillance system.
A Bill Gates speech from 2015, where he warns that the greatest threat to humanity is infectious disease, not nuclear war, has received 25 million new views in recent weeks. According to the New York Times, anti-vaxxers, right-wing pundits, and members of the conspiracy group QAnon claim the video is evidence of Gates dastardly plan to use a pandemic for his personal gain.
Gates has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump
Gates has longbeen an outspoken critic of President Trump. On Wednesday, he said Trumps decision to defund WHO was as dangerous as it sounds, although he didnt call out the president by name. Gates also criticized the administration in a recent op-ed, saying Theres no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus.
Although Gates refused to comment on his new-found notoriety, Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, told the NYT that it was distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives."

Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said that conspiracy theories linking the rollout of 5G to the spread of COVID-19 are false in an interview with CNBC today.

Vestberg was referring to communications already issued by health organizations and information combating conspiracies about wireless devices and health that can be found at www.wirelesshealthfacts.com, a Verizon spokesperson tells The Verge. That site states that radiofrequency energy from wireless devices and networks, including radiofrequencies used by 5G, has not been shown to cause health problems, according to the international scientific community, and points to resources and quotes from wireless communications bodies and health organizations supporting that assertion. 
The site also links to a WHO website that spells out how COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets and that viruses cannot travel via radio waves or mobile networks.
Despite no scientific evidence establishing a link between 5G and coronavirus, conspiracy theories connecting the two have spread across social media, leading to 5G towers in the UK being set on fire and people harassing workers laying fiber optic cables.

All substantial market corrections or bear downturns begin with some form of catalyst. Just forest fires have their proximate cause in the carelessness or maliciousness of human behavior, or lightning strike, on dried woodlands – so too must the destruction of tenuous market values always have a point of ignition.
So it was with commercial real estate defaults in the late 1990s, with Japan entering recession at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, and with residential mortgage delinquencies in 2008. So it has been with the global concern over the novel coronavirus designated COVID-19. Something, even an event wholly unrelated to the market bubble, is always the immediate trigger of a meltdown.
And, as I wrote in this space one month ago, well before the ongoing viral crisis took hold of investors' – much less the world's – attention. The equity markets (particularly those in the US) were just waiting for someone or something to strike a match.
This is not to minimize the magnitude of the viral threat. It is real and – moreover – is the cause of material supply chain, transportation, tourism and trade disruption that will have a substantial impact on economic activity over the next several months. There is even the possibility of its impacts lasting through the point at which a corresponding anti-viral vaccine can be synthesized, manufactured and distributed in large quantities. And I am washing my hands frequently. But, as with all modern pandemics, COVID-19 will eventually be tamed. 
Daniel Alpert
But is it reasonable to believe that equities will recover their inflated value? This is a less certain proposition. (Although the market closed well off its lows on Friday.)
On the one hand, this sell-off has exceeded the magnitude – in percentage terms – of market disruptions observed during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and the Ebola crisis of 2014 (albeit with some delay from the first expressions of US-related fears over coronavirus). But is this an expression of the degree of the present biological predicament, or is it the measure of the magnitude of the bubble that preceded it?
After all, in both 2003 and 2014 equity markets were a mere 30 months and 4.8 years, respectively, from their prior pre-recession highs, and 42% below and 23% above those prior highs, respectively.
The present crisis began with the S&amp;P 500 nearly 13.5 years from, and a whopping 109% above, its last pre-recessionary high. 
When news of COVID-19 hit the tape about a month ago, equity markets were about to hit further all-time highs in a rally that was unbelievably long in the tooth – supported (or not) by some of the most off-the-charts valuation multiples since 1929, 2000 and 2008. It stands to reason that the bigger they are (market valuations), the harder they fall – right?
As I pointed out last month, however, there is another enormous difference afoot: While interest rates have been falling for nearly 40 years, we are now in uncharted territory throughout the advanced world. That bonds do not offer returns that move anyone's longer-term investment needle (other than traders who, if long, have benefited enormously), has produced an environment that can only be deemed investment desperation for those seeking to have their money produce for them.
Daniel Alpert
10-year and shorter interest rates on US Treasuries are now well into negative real (inflation-adjusted) return territory. And while inflation is likely to fall as well, given pre-existing sluggish economic conditions made significantly worse by the pandemic, the US is clearly in the process of joining the majority of advanced nations in depriving savers and investors of positive risk-free returns when lending to their governments. 
This leads to the conundrum voiced to me so often by frustrated investors: ""what else are you going to do with your money?"" Until very recently, for many, the answer appeared to be to wager it on additional valuation expansion in equities. I say valuation expansion because we clearly have not been seeing either rapid economic, nor any broad earnings, growth for over a year that could have justified prices paid for stocks.
The question then becomes, will the even lower rates that this latest crisis has delivered (to say nothing of Fed action to lower the policy rate in order to stabilize equity markets – which will do nothing more than that for the economy at large), (a) reignite and increase the level of desperation that drove money into the equity markets, or (b) be seen by investors as a clear expression of actual, and anticipated further, economic weakness and stifle traffic to the casino that equity markets have increasingly become.
It is difficult for me to expect a complete return to the status quo ante – even as the COVID-19 crisis dissipates. The equity markets were sicker than the virus that knocked them back on their heels. The market's recovery will be far slower than that of patients infected with the disease.

On April 2, after weeks of criticism that the UK was lagging behind its European counterparts like Germany on testing, Hancock said he was ""setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.""
On Friday, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten the goal by more than 22,000.
Striking an upbeat tone, Hancock said: ""I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal."" 
Ambiguous numbers: Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to the public, but not necessarily returned. 
Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers. ""Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,"" he said.
The issue of testing didn't need to become so political. 
When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.
It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out such as rolling out a contact tracing program. 
So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time and no one can deny that more testing is a positive thing it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying."

Ai Weiwei has produced a series of face masks printed with his most iconic artworks to help counter the ""humanitarian crisis"" arising from Covid-19.
The Chinese artist, who is currently in lockdown in the UK, is hoping to raise at least $1 million for international charities that are helping vulnerable and displaced people impacted by the pandemic.
Three designs are being made available at $50 each, including works titled ""Mask with Middle Finger"" and ""Sunflower Seeds,"" a reference to the installation that saw Ai fill London's Tate Modern with over 100 million porcelain seeds. 
Many of the other designs, which can only be bought in larger sets of four or 20, allude to state control and freedom of expression, issues the dissident artist has long addressed in his work. Among them are images of handcuffs, a surveillance camera and a crab, a reference to a Chinese slang term for censorship.
Produced in collaboration with Guggenheim Museum curator Alexandra Munroe -- and printed by hand at Ai's studio in Berlin -- the items are available starting Thursday for the next month via eBay. 
The cloth masks are not for medical use, nor are they even meant to be worn. Instead, the artworks are intended to raise money for vulnerable groups, including the migrants and refugees whose plight has featured heavily in Ai's art and activism in recent years. 
All proceeds will go to the Covid-19 responses organized by Human Rights Watch, Refugees International and Médecins Sans Frontières.
For Ai, the threat to vulnerable people's livelihoods ""requires each individual to act, both alone and collectively.""
""Our small individual acts become powerful when they are part of the social response,"" he said in a media statement. ""An individual wearing a mask makes a gesture; a society wearing masks combats a deadly virus. And a society that wears masks because of the choices of individuals, rather than because of the directive of authorities, can defy and withstand any force.
""No will is too small, and no act is too helpless,"" he added.
In a press release, Human Rights Watch's executive director Kenneth Roth described the project as ""a powerful example of art and activism coming together for good,"" while Refugees International president Eric Schwartz called it a ""noble initiative"" that ""sounds the alarm"" on the threat the pandemic poses to displaced people. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warned on Tuesday that urban refugees in Africa are among those struggling to meet basic needs due to the economic impact of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns.
Ai has also been outspoken about the pandemic's political implications -- especially in China, where he was frequently subjected to police harassment and detention before entering self-exile in Germany in 2015. 
He has since moved to Cambridge, UK. In an interview with CNN Style last month, he expressed concern that the country's government is using its response to the virus to strengthen what he calls its ""police state.""
""For China, everything is for political use,"" Ai said, adding: ""It doesn't matter what kind of disaster they're facing. The only thing they learn is how well they use this authoritarian power to manipulate the story.""
The artist also revealed that he is producing a documentary about the pandemic, and has been working remotely with film crews in Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged.
Ai is not the only artist to turn his hand to mask-making in recent weeks. Takashi Murakami, who is known for his work with the likes of Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, has just released a series of face coverings featuring his signature flower motif, among other designs.
In the UK, a group of four renowned artists -- David Shrigley, Yinka Shonibare, Eddie Peake and Linder Sterling -- last week unveiled a series of limited edition masks. Money raised by their designs will go to the Contemporary Art Society's Rapid Response Fund, which offers financial support to artists and museums affected by coronavirus lockdowns.

Coronavirus has now killed at least 100,000 people in the US since the first death was reported in February, according to Johns Hopkins University's case count. That's an average of nearly 900 deaths per day. 
Nearly 80% of all deaths occur in people over 65
Older adults are exceedingly vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus. And according to CDC data, that risk increases with age. 
About 59% of all coronavirus deaths occur in people 75 and older, according to the CDC, which relies on less complete data than the Johns Hopkins University count. 
21% occur in people between 65 and 74, and roughly 18% occur in people ages 45 to 64. Just 3% of deaths occur in 18- to 44-year-olds. 
The US leads the world in cases and deaths 
The US death rate is 2.6 times higher than the second leading country, the United Kingdom. The UK has reported 36,875 deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University's global case count.
Both the US and the UK have heard mixed messages from leadership. President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the virus and ceded decisions about closing and reopening to the states. 
In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new message of ""Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"" has confused leaders of the three other nations in the UK, who aren't sure whether the guidance applies to them or just Britain. 
Nearly as many Americans have died of Covid-19 as in the wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan combined
More than 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam. The US coronavirus death rate is 1.7 times higher. 
Almost 37,000 Americans died in Korea. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 3 times higher. 
4,431 Americans died in Iraq. The US coronavirus death rate is 22 times higher. 
2,445 Americans died in Afghanistan. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 40 times higher. 
And by June more Americans will have likely died of coronavirus than in all four of those conflicts combined. 
Nursing homes account for 42% of deaths in most of the US
More than 35,100 nursing home deaths have been reported in 37 states, out of 174,381 cases in 42 states, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Not all states are reporting infections and deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, so these numbers may be higher on a national scale. 
With their highly vulnerable residents, frequent visitors and relatively close quarters, nursing homes are hotbeds for infection. The first significant coronavirus outbreak in the US occurred at a facility in Washington state, where at least 35 people died and dozens more residents and staff were infected.
Black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to die from the virus
Black Americans represent 13% of the population in the 40 states plus DC that have released mortality data, but they account for 25% of deaths, according to an analysis from the American Public Media (APM) Research Lab. 
At least 20,195 black Americans have died from coronavirus as of May 19, APM reported. That's roughly equivalent to 1 in 2,000 black Americans dying. 
""If they had died of Covid-19 at the same rate as white Americans, about 12,000 black Americans, 1,300 Latino Americans and 300 Asian Americans would still be alive,"" the lab said.
By comparison, white Americans, who make up 61.7% of the states that have released race mortality data, account for 49.3% of all deaths in those states. In all, white people represent 21 in 100,00 deaths. 
The Navajo Nation has the nation's highest per-capita infection rate
Data on Covid-19's impact on indigenous people is incomplete, but the numbers that do exist are bleak. 
The Navajo Nation has a population of 173,667 spread out across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. With 4,002 cases, the Navajo territory has 2,304 cases per 100,000 people. 
That's more than densely populated New York and New Jersey, which report 1,806 and 1,668 cases per 100,000 people respectively. 
In Arizona, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 5 times higher than the rate for all other groups. In New Mexico, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 7 times higher. 
More than 41% of US deaths have occurred in New York and New Jersey
The two states have seen a combined 40,279 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's count. That's more than 41% of the 97,722 deaths reported as of Monday. 
New York has reported 29,350 deaths, and 11,339 people have died in New Jersey. 
The epicenter of the country's outbreak is New York City, the most populous city in the US with 8 million residents. It's also got the country's highest population density, with 27,000 people per square mile. That, coupled with a subway system that sees 5.5 million commuters daily, make it prime breeding ground for infection.
New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, is home to hundreds of thousands of commuters who worked in the city before the pandemic hit. Plus, it has the highest population density of any state. 
Coronavirus is 2 to 3 times more contagious than the flu
A person with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people. But without mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders, a person with novel coronavirus infects an average of 2 to 3 other people. 
Researchers say the US could have prevented 84% of its deaths
If the US had locked down two weeks earlier than it did in late March and early April, 82% of its cases and 84% of its deaths could've been avoided, according to Columbia University researchers.
And if states took social distancing measures just one week earlier, more than half the number of deaths and infections would've been prevented, the researchers said.
Without a coordinated national effort, states issued stay-at-home orders on a rolling basis over two weeks. California locked down on March 20 while Florida, after pressure from lawmakers, locked down almost two weeks later. A few states, like Arkansas, never enforced a statewide stay-at-home order. 
The US still predicts up to 240,000 deaths in the first wave
Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House's coronavirus task force told Fox's Chris Wallace on Sunday that she stands by the original model, which predicted anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. At the beginning of May, Trump said he predicted 80,000 to 90,000 deaths, which the US has already exceeded. 
A second peak may follow the first wave with an even higher death toll, the World Health Organization warned Monday.
Countries must be prepared that the virus could ""jump up at any time,"" and another peak could likely occur during flu season, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. 
The US needs to test 900,000 people every day to reopen, a study says
There were 378,908 new Covid-19 tests reported on Sunday, according to the Atlantic's Covid-19 Tracking Project. That's a significant uptick since March 24, when states conducted 68,454 tests. But it's still not enough to safely reopen, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. 
In early May the institute said the US should test at least 900,000 people every day by May 15. 
Though testing access has improved considerably since the start of the pandemic, faulty tests issued by the CDC are thought to have contributed to the slow US response to the virus. Still, the responsibility to ramp up testing falls to the states, per the Trump administration's latest testing report. 
The US economy had its worst quarter since the 2008 recession
America's first-quarter GDP, the most expansive measure of the US economy, fell at a 4.8% annualized rate, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in May. 
It was the first contraction of the US economy since the first quarter of 2014, and the worst drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
43 states reported record unemployment in May
Nevada's unemployment rate is the worst in the country at 28.2%, significantly higher than its rate of 6.9% in March. Michigan and Hawaii had the next highest unemployment rates at 22.7% and 22.3%, respectively.
Things may get even worse. US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin told Fox News' Chris Wallace that the US could get close to jobless rates not seen since the Great Depression, when unemployment peaked at 25%. 
Grocery prices have risen as much as 16%
Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April. That was the biggest increase from one month to the next since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Egg prices shot up 16.1% in April. Cookies cost 5.1% more in April, too. Chicken is 5.8% more expensive, and orange prices rose 5.6%. 
It's because of disruptions in the food supply chain. Restaurants shut down, more Americans started cooking at home and more people started buying groceries, though food producers couldn't speed up their deliveries at the same rate.

""This is the first major look at Covid-19 infections among healthy young adults that the CDC has released,"" said Daniel Payne, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collaborated with the US Navy on the investigation.
More than 1,000 of the ship's nearly 4,900-member crew tested positive for Covid-19 following the outbreak. After spending weeks at a port in Guam, the ship returned to sea last month.
The majority -- nearly 60% -- of sailors in the study who had antibodies had neutralizing ones, ""a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity,"" the researchers wrote.
Most reported mild or no symptoms, and those who took preventive measures -- such as face masks and social distancing -- were less likely to become infected.
""What we saw was that most of the infections were actually mild, in addition to those that were asymptomatic,"" Payne told reporters Tuesday.
""And this is perhaps different from studies of older Americans, or maybe even those who were hospitalized already, and certainly much different from those with underlying health conditions.""
With a number of young people reporting mild, atypical, or no symptoms from the virus, ""symptom-based surveillance might not detect all infections,"" the investigators wrote.
Most tested positive for antibodies
The report, published Tuesday, included a sample of 382 service members, with a median age of 30. According to the report, three-fourths were male. 
Nearly 60% of them tested positive for antibodies, and among them, 59% had also developed neutralizing antibodies by the time their blood samples were taken. 
Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, potentially disabling it from attacking human cells. In a handful of participants, these antibodies were detected more than 40 days after their symptoms began.
However, because the data come from a single point in time, they note that longer studies will be needed to definitively show whether and how long these antibodies might protect against the virus.
Lower infection rate in those who took protective measures
Those who took preventive measures were also less likely to become infected. 
Sailors who wore face coverings were less likely to become infected (55.8% versus 80.8%), as were those who avoided common areas (53.8% versus 67.5%) and practiced physical distancing (54.7% versus 70.0%). 
Symptoms more closely associated with Covid-19 in this sample were loss of taste or smell, muscle pain, fever and chills. 
Two were hospitalized among the 238 in the study confirmed to have been infected with the virus.
Officials are working to ""tailor our public health practices to the unique characteristics of this adversary whose secret weapon, as you know, is the ability to be transmitted by an individual before they know they're infected,"" Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, the US Navy surgeon general, told reporters Tuesday.

College freshman Shemar Powell: Searching for God on Zoom
My freshman year at Morehouse College was supposed to be a major turning point -- both academically and personally. No longer in Baltimore, I was trying to start over in a new city and at a new school. By attending a historically Black college, I thought I would finally have a chance to thrive in an environment that encouraged and respected young Black men.
So, I was upset when coronavirus forced the college to shut down. It meant that I would be returning to Baltimore to complete my second semester online. It also meant that I would have to find a new part-time job, since I could no longer work at the restaurant in Atlanta where I had been employed. My only option was at a local Amazon warehouse, where I was put on the overnight shift. 
I took it, but then began the daunting task of balancing my schoolwork during the daytime and my Amazon work at night. So, how did I find that balance?
By returning to the basics, meaning my Christian faith. Even though the pandemic had challenged my faith in God -- how could a righteous and just God allow for so much pain and suffering -- I still believed it would be critical to weathering this extraordinarily challenging time. Fortunately, my church -- Healthy Choice Ministries -- is still active on Zoom. Bishop Aubrey A. Harley hosts virtual bible study sessions on Wednesday, religious services on Saturday and corporate prayer, when the church comes together to pray for a common goal, on Sunday. 
While it's hard to put into words just why those Zoom church sessions mean so much to me, the best I can do is give you an analogy. Imagine you are a small child with an ear infection. As you struggle against the pain, you feel the world is coming to an end. But then your mother approaches you, comforts you and takes you to the doctor where you get the treatment you need to heal. Church is my healing mother -- more so than my school or job or any other mainstay in my life right now.
I continue to battle exhaustion and depression, but I am grateful to have some sort of religious grounding as our country battles yet a second pandemic: racism. As ordinary -- and perhaps extraordinary -- people protest and question systems of government that have repeatedly let down folks like me, I recognize the role that my faith is playing in keeping me from losing all sense of hope. 
As my bishop explained, ""This isn't a new struggle. We know this, and God knows this. We must put it all in his hands, while remembering that we are his children and we must act as such."" In other words, failure is not an option -- we must continue to push forward, just as our ancestors did, and with God as our moral guide. 
As America reopens, and as its people call out for racial justice, it is imperative we all do our part to create a new vision for the country -- ideally one more equal, inclusive and kind toward all of its citizens.

First-year rabbinical student Avigayil Halpern: Judaism kept me from losing focus
As a person who observes Jewish law, one of the primary contributions my religious practice makes to my life is that it tells me what I should do -- and when I should do it. In quarantine, this has meant that my days are not a formless mass of hours, but instead punctuated by thrice-daily prayer times. I know when the week begins and ends because I observe Shabbat, marking the creation of the world by abstaining from creative labor.
But far more important than structuring my time, Judaism has kept me focused on my obligations. 
I am currently studying for my first major rabbinical exam, which I will take in August. Over the past few months, I have found it hard to focus on my studies. Staring at my study partner via Zoom does not compare to analyzing texts together in person, sitting in a room alive with the sounds of other voices studying aloud.
On top of that, the needs of the world have so often felt overwhelming: I've been unable to focus because of stress and fear, forcing me to leave material over for another day when I can rein in my anxieties. But this new reality has also pushed me to expand what my practice of Torah study, or the study of Jewish sacred texts, can encompass. 
Torah study during this pandemic is not just the moments when I sit pouring over an ancient or medieval book. Rabbi Yitzhcok Hutner, a 20th-century Jewish thinker, teaches that the commandment of Torah study includes things one would never imagine fall into that category: all of the care work that enables someone to study Torah, and all of the care work that Torah, properly understood, pushes one to do for herself and others. Just as I'm devoting my time to textual study, I'm devoting my time to care work: from phone calls with friends who are struggling to cooking food for my family and myself.
My religious obligations lie not only in offering care to my loved ones, but in the profound act of care that is committing myself -- and my community -- to pursuing justice. In this moment, where it is acutely evident that racism is a public health crisis happening alongside, and exacerbated by, a pandemic, Judaism is pushing me to redistribute money to organizations supporting Black life and, in particular, Black trans people. It is pushing me to work within my community to advocate for concrete anti-racist commitments from the Jewish organizations and leaders that are important in my own life. 
But my religion has done even more for me than helping me focus on my obligations. It has been a guide for what larger priorities I should orient myself toward in all moments of my life, and it has given me a path for how I can contribute to building a world less ravaged by the injustices that make life so unstable for so many.

College sophomore Bella Hanesworth: Awakening my 'Buddha nature'
When the pandemic began, my school -- Mercy College -- quickly transitioned to virtual classes. The sudden shift in learning was anything but smooth, and I struggled to stay focused on my coursework. 
Fortunately, though, I was able to find an anchor in my Buddhist faith. As a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism and a member of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), I embraced the virtual platform that my Buddhist meetings were taking -- and in them, I found the strength to press on. 
This practice teaches that each person possesses the potential to overcome all obstacles. We refer to this potential as our ""Buddha nature"" -- a state of life filled with limitless courage, wisdom and compassion. By chanting the phrase ""Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,"" we help to awaken our Buddha nature. And so, I resolved to chant daily for the knowledge to navigate through this crisis. 
I didn't just rely on chanting. I turned to my fellow SGI members, who showed unwavering compassion and belief in my ability to weather the worst storm. They encouraged me to consistently reach out to my friends, family and other members. In doing so, I could strengthen them -- and perhaps even myself. In other words, we could help each other, offering kind words and support as needed. 
After my semester ended, I felt relief and immense appreciation. I had made it through the worst of the pandemic -- and my friends and family were healthy and safe. But then yet another Black man, George Floyd, was killed -- and the racist systems embedded in our society were exposed. 
The goal of SGI is to achieve ""kosen-rufu"" -- a state in which society functions based on respect for people's lives. As Buddhists, it's our mission to uproot the causes of systemic racism and transform our current reality. And still, I often feel small and powerless in the face of such large-scale and institutionalized problems.
My mentor, Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda, says, ""When the realists tell us to accept a world of suffering, a world of war and injustice, what they are really doing is displaying the stagnation and failure of their own imagination... It is the power of imagination, the power to imagine different realities, that frees us from the mistaken notion that what exists now is all that will ever exist."" 
When I pause to really consider the meaning of his words, I feel hopeful again. Buddhist philosophy gives me the tools to continuously challenge my biases, engage in constructive dialogue and fight for justice. And after months of a pandemic -- and time for intense introspection -- I feel more committed to that fight than ever before.

College freshman Justice Georgie: Never underestimate the power of prayer
When the pandemic struck, I was completing my second semester at Baltimore Community College -- working on getting the necessary credits to begin at Morgan State University. I had found a solid group of friends and was actively pursuing my passion of video production and digital storytelling.
But Covid-19 had other plans for me.
With my campus closing down, I moved home to my mother's one-bedroom apartment, giving up the cozy dorm room I had called my own, and began the unenjoyable task of virtual learning. The transition was not the smoothest -- and with my mother, a hairdresser, temporarily out of work -- it was a stressful beginning to a new chapter of my life.
Fortunately, I had someone who I could consistently turn to for love and guidance -- God. Raised as a Christian in an all-denomination church, I was taught that no matter where we come from, everyone can pray and praise God together. Every Sunday growing up, I went to Genesis Thru Revelations Deliverance Church. There I found the tools, and the support system, needed to control my fears and anxieties. I also found a community of fellow worshippers who encouraged me to be a better version of myself.
Now, in the midst of a pandemic and protests against racial injustice, my belief in God and my church's ingenuity have helped me channel my fears into something more productive. Though it cannot hold in-person services yet, my church hosts Sunday morning service online. My pastor frequently reminds us that prayer is one of our most powerful weapons -- and when we join in prayer with others, we form an impenetrable spiritual wall against the many threats lurking around us.
As Proverbs 3:5-6 states, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."" As the virus -- and police brutality -- continue to impact my community and my country, I will continue to turn to my source of light and life -- the Holy One, blessed be his name. Only he can truly make me believe that this, too, shall pass.

High school junior Yasmin Errazi: Islam taught me to take nothing for granted
Between going on college tours, studying for the SATs and practicing for a learner's permit, junior year of high school is already overwhelming. But throw a pandemic and a country's reckoning with its centuries of racism into the mix, and it can seem like an exercise in futility. 
Fortunately, I have been able to turn to my religion -- Islam -- to keep me calm and even optimistic about the future. This year, as Covid-19 gripped the country, I paused to celebrate Ramadan, a one-month holiday devoted to daily prayer, fasting and charity. 
Though I was juggling virtual learning and intense academic demands, fasting and praying each day from late-April to late-May gave me a surprising amount of strength and even gratitude for all that I've been given -- including a loving family and community, which came together, in a socially distanced way, to celebrate the holiday.
Every day at sunset, when my family would break fast, I was reminded of the many Americans who struggle to put food on the table -- and the many more who would experience food insecurity in light of rising unemployment. But in this struggle, I also saw an opportunity to give more zakat, or charity, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. Charity can take many forms -- not just monetary donations. During this period, I've donated my time to raising awareness around issues of poverty and social injustice. 
Though my mosque was closed at the height of the pandemic, it, too, still managed to prioritize charity. It organized a food bank to assist Muslims in the community and hired volunteers to deliver everything from fresh fruits and vegetables to baby diapers. While I wasn't able to volunteer due to looming school deadlines, I was inspired by the kindness of my community and took the spare moments I could find to immerse myself further in the teachings of Islam -- reading the Quran and praying more regularly.
One teaching that stood out to me was the Prophet Mohammed's emphasis on maintaining strong family ties. Without my family and their constant support through these challenging times, I would likely have struggled to maintain any semblance of optimism or normalcy. Learning that Islam encouraged -- if not demanded -- I invest more time in my family made me feel even more at peace during these chaotic times.
Though the pandemic appears far from over, I am grateful that I've been able to use this time to reflect on my faith, my purpose and my many blessings. And I am especially thankful I have a religion that has taught me the value of never taking anyone -- or anything -- for granted.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)I have been with my partner Marco for almost 20 years.
We've survived the normal things every couple faces, along with the serious challenges life throws at you. But now we are being kept apart by Covid-19.
I am in New York City. Marco is in Italy.
We haven't seen each other in six months.
On July 1st, the European Union effectively banned Americans from traveling there. 
Spouses of EU citizens are an exception and allowed in, but unmarried partners aren't.
Since we are not legally married, an ocean separates me and my partner indefinitely. 
Thousands of unmarried couples all over the world have been impacted and have joined forces to gain attention with the group ""Love is not tourism"" and the hashtags #Loveisnottourism and #Loveisessential. 
Indeed, this is certainly not about tourism. I don't want to go to Italy to see the Colosseum or go to the Vatican. I want to be with my other half. I want to be with my other half; the person with whom I've shared life changing moments.
I met Marco on sabbatical in Italy after the loss of my parents. He helped me back from the grief and nurtured me through some difficult days early in our relationship.
We've gone through my breast cancer diagnosis, radiation treatment and, then just when we were about to start our life together full time in Italy, our most difficult hurdle.
I had given up my career as a journalist in New York City in 2008 to permanently join Marco in Italy, where I planned to freelance, but then everything came to a devastating stop. 
Because of my breast cancer diagnosis, I was getting annual checkups. During one of my routine follow ups, I was diagnosed with leukemia, which was later confirmed to be linked to my volunteer work at Ground Zero. I was there days after the 9/11 attack serving food to first responders as they searched for survivors.
The diagnosis was absolutely shattering.
I put plans to move full time on hold, and together Marco and I navigated the stress and uncertainty of a life-threatening illness.
We accepted that we would have to be in a long distance relationship for a good part of 2008, and I found amazing doctors in New York City for whom I'm so grateful.
My health and survival came first.
So for the past decade I have traveled back and forth between NYC and Italy, returning to see my hematologist and receive treatment from the World Trade Center Health Program.
It's not always easy. There have been too many visits to emergency rooms in Italy, and the travel is fatiguing because of the chemotherapy medication I must take.
But through it all, Marco and I have managed to make our relationship work and grow even stronger. It's not traditional, but we have committed to a life together.
I truly believe that the beauty and wonderful people of Italy have also helped keep me going. Not to mention the spaghetti and gelato. 
So in January, after another wonderful Christmas stay in Tuscany, I returned to New York as usual for my medical visits.
And then the Coronavirus stopped the world in its tracks. My April flight back to Rome was canceled. And then my July flight as well.
And there is no sign I will be allowed back in any time soon.
Yes, I am not legally married. I never signed a piece of paper, but Marco and I have definitely been together in sickness and health.
This is my story, but it's just one story. The campaign to bring more awareness to this issue has highlighted the struggles, for example, of expectant moms separated from their partners and couples working in different countries. 
A few EU countries -- at the time of writing, not including Italy -- have now agreed to allow nonmarried partners in, so there is some hope. 
So, to my dear Italy: Please let me come back to you.
I will take a Covid-19 test. I will quarantine. I know you believe in love; You practically invented it."

About 200 new cases and two new deaths were reported Thursday, Gov. David Ige said.
""There is no question that the virus is surging,"" he said. ""This is the last thing that we wanted to do...As we reopen our community people let their guard down. It's been very disappointing.""
Ige announced that a 14-day inter-island travel quarantine will be in place starting August 11 to stop further spread to other islands.
Bruce Anderson, Director of Hawaii Department of Health, said 117 Covid patients are in the hospital statewide, with 115 of them on Oahu. 
More than 53% of the ICU beds on the island are filled, he said.
Hospitals could be overwhelmed by the end of the month if the upward trend of new cases continues as 10% of people who test positive for Covid-19 end up in the hospital, Anderson said.
""We are approaching a healthcare crisis and bold measures are needed now,"" he said.
Anderson noted the new cases on Oahu were linked to community spread on all parts of the island, across all socioeconomic groups and communities. 
In response to the dramatic increase in coronavirus cases, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced Thursday that all beaches and parks will be closed on Oahu.
The source of the new virus spread has been tied to ""large, uncontrolled gatherings,"" Caldwell said during a press conference. ""We need to clamp down."" 
As a result, a new executive order will be in effect at midnight on Friday through September 5 closing all county and state parks, as well as the beaches fronting them. 
What the restrictions will mean
No activities will be allowed on the beach or in the parks but people will be allowed to walk on the beach to get to the water for surfing, fishing, paddling and diving, Caldwell said.
Parking lots with ballot drop off boxes will remain open through the weekend so people can vote but they will close after that, Caldwell said. All team sports that take place at parks are suspended.
""What's open are things we can control and where we have seen compliance,"" the mayor explained.
Fitness centers will be allowed to stay open but will be banned from providing group classes.
Caldwell said indoor attractions such as bowling alleys, arcades, and mini golf will also be closed. 
In addition, the mask requirements for restaurants will be expanded to cooks in the kitchen. There will also be stronger enforcement on bars ""posing as restaurants,"" Caldwell said. 
The Honolulu Police Department has created a new Covid Enforcement Team that will respond to complaints and perform proactive patrols, Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard said during the press conference.
She added that 160 additional officers will be working seven days a week as part of that team. Police have been trying to warn and educate people but will now be issuing citations, Ballard said.
""At this point we're probably going to do very few warnings,"" the police chief said. ""It's going to be citations or arrests."""

It provides evidence that people have stayed away from the emergency room even with acute heart attack symptoms. And some may have died as a result.
Researchers from the Providence Heart Institute system based in the US northwest looked at the records of more than 15,000 heart attack patients from between December 30 and May 16 of this year. 
They found ""important changes"" in heart attack hospitalization rates. Patients also fared worse during the early and later parts of the pandemic, they reported Friday in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology. 
And patients with the most serious type of heart attack appeared to be more than twice as likely to die at one point. 
There was a substantial decrease in hospitalizations early in the pandemic, with the case rates starting to fall on February 23. 
Patients hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic tended to be younger by about 1 to 3 years than patients before the pandemic. The authors think older patients may have had a ""greater reluctance"" to get medical help if they had symptoms. Typically, older people have gotten sicker from Covid-19.
Patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic spent less time at the hospital than before the pandemic. This may be because hospitals wanted to keep beds open in case they were needed for Covid-19 patients, the researchers said. The patients were all seen at hospitals within the Providence St. Joseph Health System in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Washington. 
Patients were also more likely to be sent home from the hospital rather than sent to a rehabilitation center. That may have been out of a concern about the risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus at those facilities.
Around March 29, the number of people hospitalized for a heart attack did increase, but it was at a slower rate than before the pandemic. It took five full weeks to go back to the levels hospitals were seeing pre-pandemic. The researchers think the shift may have been after doctors started encouraging patients with symptoms to follow through and get care. 
The researchers couldn't find evidence that doctors were treating patients any differently than they would when there wasn't a pandemic. Yet there was a real difference in how well some patients did. 
There was a substantial increase in deaths among patients who suffered a more serious type of heart attack called STEMI. That's when one of the arteries is blocked and blood and oxygen can't get to the heart. 
The rate of people who died from these serious heart attacks was even greater during the later part of the pandemic, the study found.
""Compared with the before COVID-19 period, however, patients with STEMI had a statistically greater risk of mortality during the later COVID-19 period,"" they wrote. One way of analyzing the deaths, called an observed to expected ratio, indicated patients were more than twice as likely to die from STEMI heart attacks during the study period.
 Time matters with a serious heart attack. A delay in care due to a patient's reluctance to seek help or because emergency medical services were behind or the emergency department was full could hurt the chances of survival. 
This study is in line with what others have found. Early research published before it was peer reviewed saw a 25% drop in the number of acute coronary syndrome cases in March of this year compared to March of 2018 and 2019. 
A letter published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine found the number of patients in the US undergoing imaging for a stroke decreased by 39% since before the pandemic. 
The researchers say more study is needed to determine exactly what contributed to the increased number of deaths.
In April, concerned about this trend, the American Heart Association put out an urgent statement asking people to call 911 if they felt heart attack symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea. For women it's more common to have symptoms like unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. 
The AHA's Don't Die of Doubt campaign was necessary, the association's president Dr. Mitchell S.V. Elkind said, because people having a heart attack have a much better chance of surviving if they get help immediately.
""If people feel that they might be having symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, then they should call 911, even during the pandemic,"" Elkind said.
Elkind, who was not a part of the Providence study, said he would like to know more about why this has been happening. 
""Common sense would tell us that many people were afraid to come into the hospital during the pandemic, but there are some other reasons as well,"" Elkind said. 
In addition to fear, he heard patients say that they didn't want to be a bother to doctors who are so busy. Elkind is a neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital and professor of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University.
Elkind said there may also have been fewer people having heart attacks.
""This is a little bit more controversial theory,"" Elkind said. But with everyone on lockdown, there were fewer cars on the road and less pollution. ""We know that air pollution is an important risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. So that could account for some of the same effect. There may have been an actual decrease in incidence of these events."""

Early in the outbreak, health experts stressed that older adults were most at risk for the virus that has infected more than 4.8 million people in the United States, but new data from the World Health Organization shows that most cases -- by far -- are reported in people ages 25 to 64. The proportion of cases in teens and young adults has gone up six-fold, and in very young children and babies the proportion has increased seven-fold, WHO said.
The increase might be explained by broader testing, greater detection of milder cases and shifting demographics of hotspots, but ""a rise in risky behavior after easing of public health and social measures"" is also to blame, WHO said.
In Georgia a 7-year-old child with no underlying conditions became the youngest person in the state to die of the virus.
""This is a disease everyone should take seriously. Please watch out for each other,"" Dr. Lawton Davis, the Health Director for Georgia's Coastal Health District, said.
A resurgence of large parties and social outings have been a source of widespread infections following the loosening of restrictions, and they are most often attended by younger people, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said Wednesday. They have recently become the hardest hit population in the county and continue to drive numbers up, she said.
In New Mexico, where one fifth of all cases are reported in people ages 20 to 29, the state's Human Services secretary, Dr. David Scrase, urged people not to plan big gatherings for Labor Day.
""Just do that cookout with the people you live with,"" Scrase said Thursday. ""Don't get the family together. There will be more time to do that.""
Masks could save 70,000 lives
More than 160,000 have died of coronavirus in the US so far and that number could nearly double by December, the director of a leading model said Thursday.
But consistently wearing masks could save nearly 70,000 of the 295,000 people projected to die of the virus by December 1, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) director Dr. Christopher Murray said on CNN's Global Town Hall.
""It's rare that you see something so simple, so inexpensive, so easy for everybody to participate in can have such an extraordinary impact in the US and also all over the world,"" Murray said.
At least 39 states as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico have implemented mask requirements of some kind. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear extended his state's mask mandate by 30 days on Thursday, saying ""It's working.""
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated mask recommendations on its website, urging people not use masks with valves or vents. While the one-way valve keeps people cooler by allowing air to escape, that also means respiratory droplets that carry the virus can escape and infect others.
Balancing rush for a vaccine and 'ethical principles'
Vaccines are being developing quickly in hopes of getting the pandemic under control, but health experts caution they will only be released to the public once they are safe.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is looking forward to getting the vaccine when it has reached a necessary standard.
""When the vaccine becomes available after a 30,000-person-or-more placebo-controlled randomized trial, and it's shown to be safe and effective, I would get it any time within the timeframe of the people who prioritize it according to ethical principles,"" Fauci told the POLITICO Pulse Check podcast.
He said he is ""satisfied"" with the first week enrollment in Moderna's Phase 3 clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine, which saw 1,290 people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a dummy shot. Moderna plans to enroll 30,000 people in its trial.
Fauci told CNN that he expects ""to get an answer"" about whether the vaccine works in November or December. 
President Donald Trump hopes to get an answer much sooner. He said Thursday he is ""optimistic"" that a vaccine could be ready by election day on November 3. 
But former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday that giving specific dates for when a vaccine could be available is ""very dangerous.""
""We can't sacrifice our standards because if we do, it not only hurts people, but it's going to damage people's faith in vaccine efforts,"" Murthy said.
Experts call for a national plan
Federal officials have often been at odds with local leaders and health experts, and five former directors of the CDC said it is time for national leadership against the pandemic.
""It's unbelievable that six months into the pandemic, it's not clear who's in charge, federally,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a roundtable hosted by ABC News Live. ""There's no plan. There's no common data that we're looking at to see what's happening with the virus and what's happening with our response.""
The CDC being sidelined early on and contradictory messages from the Trump administration has led to partisanship, confusion and increased spread of the virus, Frieden said.
Dr. Richard Besser, who was an acting CDC chief during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, said return to school has been complicated by the mixed messages. ""If you have politicians saying that CDC guidance is a barrier to getting children back into school, instead of the roadmap for doing it safely, then whole system breaks down,"" Besser said.
In the absence of national leadership, state officials have been taking measures against the virus into their own hands. 
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards extended bar closures Thursday and announced the state will stay in Phase Two of its reopening plan, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio extended the city's state of emergency, which was first signed in March, for another 30 days.

More than 2 million Americans struggle with opioid use disorder, and about 130 Americans on average die every day from an opioid overdose. Opioids account for a majority of drug overdose deaths, the leading cause of accidental death in the US. It's a crisis that's been a priority for officials at the federal, state and local levels for years.
Now, the coronavirus has disrupted all matters of life across the country -- including efforts to combat the nation's opioid problem.
Walk-in clinics and syringe exchange programs have been closed. Community support groups are meetingvirtually. 
Some who struggle with substance abuse are homeless or incarcerated and can't comply with social distancing guidelines, while those who can are left isolated and at risk. On top of all that, the pandemic is causing massive stress -- a primary driver of relapse. 
""This changing, very strange world that we're living through could serve as a trigger for people to return to drug use,"" said Daliah Heller, director of drug use initiatives at the public health organization Vital Strategies. ""And that brings a great potential for overdose with it.""
As local officials report spikes in overdose calls and deaths, experts and advocates say they're concerned the coronavirus pandemic is making an already serious problem worse.
Local officials are reporting overdose spikes
County coroners, law enforcement and emergency responders around the country are reporting spikes in overdose calls and deaths -- and they're concerned that's connected to Covid-19.
Franklin County, Ohio, reported 28 non-fatal overdoses from last Friday night to Saturday night. The previous Friday, the county had six overdose deaths, which coroner Anahi Ortiz had described as a ""surge"" in a Facebook post.
Ortiz wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that Franklin County had seen a 50% increase in fatal overdoses from January to April 15.Sixty-two people died of overdoses in the month of April alone, she wrote.
Niagara County in New York reported last month that drug overdoses spiked 35% from January 1 to April 6, compared to the same time last year.
And in Jacksonville, Florida, the fire and rescue chief said the city saw a 20% increase in overdose calls from February to March.
It's too soon to determine whether such reports are evidence of a larger trend, said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Federal and state data on fatal and non-fatal overdoses for the past few months are not yet available, while coroners and medical examiners are overwhelmed with cases of Covid-19 and may not have the resources to follow up on overdose deaths, she said.
""We do not know,"" Volkow said, of whether more people are overdosing in connection with Covid-19. ""In many cases, we will likely never know.""
But she predicts that some communities will ""absolutely"" see an uptick in overdoses.
Public health services are disrupted
There are a few reasons that experts are concerned about a potential coronavirus-related increase in opioid overdoses.
For one, harm reduction programs across the country have beenexperiencing reduced capacity given the pandemic, Heller said.
Though many states have defined such services as essential in their stay-at-home orders, some programs have had to restrict access or reduce staffing because of a lack of funding or personal protective equipment for their workers.
Federal agencies have eased some regulations that have mitigated the risks of overdoses and Covid-19 infection, Heller said.
For example, patients receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder often have to visit a provider daily for a dose of methadone. But because such visits could expose both patients and health care workers to Covid-19, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is temporarily allowing treatment programs to provide patients with two to four weeks' worth of methadone doses to take home. 
Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has also relaxed telehealth restrictions around prescriptions for buprenorphine, another medication-assisted treatment.
Still, for people who lack health insurance or high-speed internet access, there are barriers.
People are engaging risky behaviors
In some communities, services that treat addiction or prevent overdoses, such as needle exchange programs, are on hold -- leading people to engage in risky behaviors. 
Jamie Favaro is the founder of Next Distro, a harm reduction organization that provides syringes and the overdose-reversing naloxone online and through the mail. She said her organization is receiving about five times as many requests as usual because people haven't had access to sterile syringes. A significant volume of requests is coming from people in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, she said.
Recently, she said, a client in West Virginia requested syringes after sharing a single needle with three other people for a week. The exchange programs in their area were shut down, the client said, and there was nowhere else to get syringes. Other clients have reached out saying they are also reusing syringes or have had needles break off in their skin, she said.
""I'm very fearful that we're going to see an HIV spike and a Hepatitis C spike, as well as an overdose spike in areas where the needle exchange programs have shut down,"" Favaro said.
More harm reduction programs around the country are beginning to mail syringes and naloxone to people who use opioids, Favaro added. County health departments are ramping up naloxonedistribution to protect against overdoses too.
But the coronavirus pandemic presents challenges there as well.
When someone overdoses on opioids, another person generally administers naloxone to reverse those effects. Because of social distancing, Volkow said, it's possible that some individuals may not have anyone else around to administer the life-saving medication.
The drug supply is affected
Another reason people are at heightened risk of opioid overdoses has to do with how Covid-19 has affected the nation's illicit drug supply, experts say.
Illegal drugs are typically smuggled into the US from other countries, but border restrictions brought on by the pandemic could theoretically decrease drug access in some areas, Volkow said.
On the surface, Heller said, that might seem like a good thing. But a limited supply could drive dealers to increase the potency of products to meet demand, mixing powerful, synthetic opioids like fentanyl into drugs and putting those who use them at a greater risk of overdose. 
Less access to drugs could also drive users to seek out other, unfamiliar drug sources -- or risk withdrawal.
Stress could drive people to relapse
Finally, the social isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is leaving people especially vulnerable.
Some support groups for people experiencing opioid addiction or for those in recovery are now taking place over Zoom, Volkow said. But the virtual contact often just isn't the same. 
""One of the most powerful interventions is to keep people in treatment is that social network,"" she said. ""Isolation can lead you to seek out some relief, like starting to take drugs.""
It will be a while before we know the true effects that Covid-19 has had on those who struggle with opioid use disorders, Volkow said. But already, there are many reasons to worry."

With schools closed since March and April -- as coronavirus cases soared to more than 4.3 million and deaths climbed to 149,256, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- a knowledge gap has persisted around how young children experience and spread the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Tuesday.
""We don't know the full impact,"" Fauci said during a discussion with Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""We don't have the total database of knowing what there is to expect.""
As states have attempted to allow businesses to reopen their doors, the nation has continued to debate how and when it would be safe to send students back to school. 
Some states have begun to put plans in place to make in-person learning safer and online learning more effective. Tennessee announced testing and contact tracing measures within schools, Oregon set restrictions for schools that can allow students back and Connecticut is investing $43.5 million in providing digital devices to help students learn remotely. 
Although Fauci said that there is no ""uni-dimensional answer"" to how schools should reopen he reiterated that the ""default position should be that we should try to the best of our ability to get the children back to school.""
Fauci encouraged teachers to wear a mask, cover their eyes with either goggles or a face shield, and maybe wear gloves to help create a safe classroom. He also said he believes a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year. 
""I feel with some cautious optimism that it is a reasonable statement to make that by December we're going to have a safe and effective vaccine.""
Vaccine prevents severe disease and stops it from spreading
Moderna's experimental vaccine is moving quickly and showing promising results as it begins Phase 3 testing.
The vaccine, which the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases helped develop, moved to begin testing on humans Monday, making it the fastest advancement of a new vaccine in the US ever.
The vaccine was tested on rhesus macaque monkeys. And though it isn't clear if the vaccine will work on humans the way it does on the primates, results from the testing show that after two days, most infected monkeys no longer had a detectable amount of the virus in their lungs, NIAID researchers said in a statement.
None of the monkeys that got the higher dose of vaccine had virus in their noses, either. That would suggest the vaccine might prevent the spread of the virus, even if people do get infected.
""This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway, the investigators note,"" the researchers said.
If the vaccine does the same for humans, it could greatly reduce the spread of the diseases, they said.
Hydroxychloroquine rumors distracting from the 'most powerful weapon' available
As the nation waits for a vaccine, rumors that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine can act as a treatment continue to perpetuate, including in President Donald Trump's administration.
But the drug has not been shown to be effective against coronavirus, and can even produce harmful side effects, former US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.
""All the time that we often end up spending dispelling these myths around hydroxychloroquine is time that we are not spending working on solving the actual problem in front of us,"" Murthy said.
And measures already in place to combat the virus' spread could be the key to solving the problem, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield said Tuesday in an interview with ABC news.
 ""We have the most powerful weapon in our hands right now, I mean it's an enormously powerful weapon. It's just a simple, flimsy mask,"" Redfield said. ""This virus can be defeated if people just wear a mask.""
Numbers on the decline after face mask requirements 
Although some states continue to see surges and set records in the numbers of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, Tuesday's total of new cases across the nation stood at 56,336, the second lowest in the past 20 days. The country's seven-day average for new cases was 65,083 Monday, the lowest figure since July 15.
Kentucky, a state that is among the at least 41 to require masks, reported 532 new cases Tuesday and a 5.08% positivity rate, which has gone down for the first time in four days, Gov. Andy Beshear said.
""Again, too early to draw conclusions, but I hope I've said, I hope that this is us starting to see, because the time period is right, where the facial covering requirement is starting to kick in and help,"" Beshear added.
Fauci reiterated advice to states still seeing surges Tuesday: wear masks, social distance, close bars where spread is high, wash hands and reopen economies in phases.
""We would hope that (states) all now rethink at what happens when you don't adhere to that,"" Fauci told ""Good Morning America.""

The reason is simple: the US is experiencing a surge in cases, with states such as Florida, Texas and California reporting thousands of new confirmed cases in recent weeks.
At the peak of the pandemic in April, 59,538 people were hospitalized nationwide on April 15, according to the Covid Tracking Project. That number reached its lowest level on June 15 with 27,772 people hospitalized. But as of July 20, that number has climbed back up to 58,330 -- just hints beneath April's high.
Adm. Brett Giroir, an official on the White House coronavirus task force, said on Monday there was ""no question we are having a surge right now.""
But while President Donald Trump, his allies and some Republican governors have pointed to increased testing as the reason, others have rightly pointed out that hospitalizations are not the result of testing, as testing does not send people to the hospital. 
Only a serious illness like Covid-19 would do that.
""As rates of testing increase, we also are seeing increases in three other key indicators that suggest we are seeing a real increase in Covid infections,"" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Alabama School of Medicine. She cited hospitalization rates, positivity rates, and deaths, which are now increasing in 26 states.
Here's how the coronavirus is affecting hospitals in areas where it is spreading.
Hospitalizations in Florida
Hospitalizations in Florida have risen by more than a third in just the 12 days since the state started releasing daily hospitalization data. Data from the Covid Tracking Project and the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) show a 37% rise in hospitalizations since data became available July 10.
There are more than 9,500 people hospitalized in Florida and least 53 hospitals in 27 counties said they had no more beds in their ICUs, according to AHCA data.
Statewide, ICU bed availability stands at 15.98% -- that's ""available adult ICU beds,"" according to AHCA data. On Monday, the available ICU bed count was 18.1%.
Miami-Dade County has exceeded its ICU capacity, with 130% occupancy on Monday, according to the county's Covid-19 dashboard.
Another number to consider: More than 3 million people in Florida have been tested for Covid-19 with 350,047 testing positive. The overall positivity rate as of Monday morning was 18.7%, up from 18.2% on Sunday, according to John Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center.
For comparison, in New York City, where the pandemic first took hold in the US, officials reported a positivity rate of just 2%.
Hospitalizations in California
California was the first state to issue a stay-at-home order on March 18.
Less than a month later, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said residents had ""bent the curve,"" and the state started to phase out the early stages of its reopening plan in May.
Then cases surged. Newsom banned indoor dining, shuttered bars and forced many businesses to close once again.
Now, Los Angeles County has surpassed its record for daily hospitalizations for the fourth time in just the past week alone, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the county's public health director.
The county has at least 2,232 patients currently hospitalized with 26% of them in the ICU and 19% on ventilators, according to the county's public health department.
Statewide, hospitalization rates and those in the intensive care unit are again reaching highs with increases of 1.9% and 0.7% respectively, according to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).
Meanwhile, California's positivity rate over the past two weeks stands at 7.5%, which is slightly under the state's goal of remaining below 8%, according to CDPH data. More than 6.5 million tests have been performed to date.
""We opened up too soon,"" Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the University of California Los Angeles, told CNN. ""We didn't have the virus totally under control.""
California is fast approaching New York in total number of confirmed cases, and at this rate, could easily surpass New York to have the highest number of confirmed cases in the US.
""Whatever is done, states experiencing these increases in severe illness and with health care facilities under siege need help and a plan B, because plan A, reopening with lukewarm or no adherence to masks or social distancing clearly did not work,"" Marrazzo said.
Hospitalizations in Texas
Hospitals in Texas are facing an unprecedented wave of hospitalizations -- it is the only state in the US currently with more than 10,000 hospitalizations. 
Texas has 10,848 people currently hospitalized, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 
While that number is still comparably low to the record 18,825 hospitalized in New York during the peak of the pandemic, there are fears it could potentially be matched or surpassed at its current rate.
On Monday, President Trump acknowledged that the state, along with Florida, was dealing with a ""flare up"" in cases.
The US Navy sent 70 medical personnel from Pensacola, Florida, to support civilian hospitals in Texas as the state deals with an increase in cases. The Navy said in a statement Tuesday that it was responding to a request for help from state officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The sailors 
It's not the second wave -- it's the first
Officials and experts have long warned the public about bracing for a second wave, but the first wave has not truly ended and the spread of the virus has not even remotely been contained, some experts say. 
""Some places never experienced an end of a first wave -- certainly in the South, we never really got below a baseline level since April,"" Marrazzo said. ""A real second wave to me would be if someplace that has truly controlled spread, like New York or Connecticut, had another surge.""
Marrazzo believes that the surge in hospitalizations can be attributed to one simple thing: The uncontrolled and sustained spread of infection in the community. Until the spread of the virus is contained, the rate of hospitalizations will continue to remain high.
""None of those currently experiencing these worrisome trends ever fulfilled the criteria laid out by the task force, which included a sustained downtrend in the percent positive tests for at least 2 weeks,"" Marrazzo said.
At least 27 states in the US have paused or rolled back their reopening plans due to the rising rates of infections. The math is simple: more infections will lead to more hospitalizations.

""Notable increases"" in deaths were seen in March and early April, the team led by the Yale School of Public Health found. This was especially true in New York and New Jersey, states hard-hit by the pandemic. 
The study was first reported by the Washington Post.
Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the team found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19. ""That is close to double,"" Dan Weinberger, who studies the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Yale, told CNN.
The team could not show whether the increased deaths were due to coronavirus, Weinberger said. But there are strong indications that they were. For instance, the team also looked at data on doctor visits.
""What we see is that in many states, you see an increase in influenza-like illnesses, and then a week or two later, you see an increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza,"" Weinberger said. ""It provides some confirmation that what we are seeing is related to coronavirus."" 
Plus, in especially hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey, where coronavirus is known to have spread widely and infected many people, overall deaths were far in excess in what would normally have been expected in March. 
""In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote.
Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths. The state reporting of deaths in the pandemic closely tracked what the Yale team found. But others did not.
""For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive). 
The new coronavirus causes respiratory disease, and deaths would presumably be listed among the regular reports of deaths and illness from pneumonia and influenza. But doctors are increasingly reporting other, sometimes fatal, symptoms from Covid-19, including strokes, kidney failure and heart damage.
Patients already weakened by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may have had a death listed as being due to one of those causes, rather than coronavirus. 
Plus, it's possible that coronavirus lockdowns would have led to a lower-than-average death rate. For instance, if fewer people were driving, traffic deaths could be expected to fall, Weinberger said.
So Weinberger's team looked at both deaths from pneumonia and influenza, and deaths from all causes.
""We decided to look at all deaths from pneumonia, or all deaths overall, and see how those numbers were changing,"" Weinberger said.
The CDC tracks deaths from pneumonia and influenza by the week, and compares them to a baseline of deaths to keep tabs on the annual epidemic of seasonal flu. Separately, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC, keeps data on all reported deaths.
The Yale-led team subtracted the expected number of deaths for each week from the total number of deaths that were actually reported, and counted the extra as Covid deaths.
""Many states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to P&amp;I (pneumonia and influenza) starting in mid-March through March 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity,"" the team wrote in their report.
Weinberger's team found evidence that people were dying as states struggled to find out if the virus had even arrived in their regions. ""In some states, such as Florida and Georgia, the increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks,"" they wrote. 
The researchers said their work shows it may be more accurate to estimate Covid deaths, rather than try to count each and every positive test.
""Given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions,"" they wrote.
""It also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with COVID-19 directly or indirectly.""
Some public health experts have said Covid-19 was almost certainly spreading in the United States in January and perhaps as early as December, long before the U.S. reported the first official death. Some state and local health officials are going back to see if people who died in January and February may have in fact been infected with coronavirus. 
Officials in California said last week that a 57-year-old woman who died February 6 had been infected with Covid-19 and was actually the first recorded death in the US from the virus. Before that announcement, the first coronavirus death in the US was thought to be that of a man in Washington on Feb. 29."

First it's important to understand how the virus attacks our lungs. When people are infected, the virus travels to the mucus membranes and then the lungs. To control the infection, the body responds with inflammation in the lungs. And this inflammation prevents the lungs from being able to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide, which leads the patient to gasp for air andsuffer more serious illness. 
But there are things you can do to improve respiratory health, just by changing a few lifestyle factors, according to Dr. Robert Eitches, an allergist and immunologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Enhancing your respiratory healthdoesn't prevent you from getting infected, he said. But itdoes have benefits that may reduce the severity of the illness if you are infected, and therefore your exposure to the virus. 
Here's how you can strengthen your body's respiratory capacity so that if you do get infected with coronavirus, the chances of serious illness may be lower. 
One of the most important steps to improving your respiratory health is avoiding anything that impairs lung function, such as smoking cigarettes and vaping, Eitches said. 
Smoking and vaping cause irritation in the lung airways that leads to permanent, adverse effects on lung function by destroying lung tissue where air exchange occurs. 
""Smoke is composed of small particles; when inhaled, the particles get stuck in the lungs,"" Eitches said. ""This begins a vicious cycle of permanent lung damage."" 
Both activities can also suppress the immune system, which you need to be able to help fight infections. 
Dr. Ryan Steele, an allergist-immunologist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, cautioned against smoking marijuana, too. 
""Even though there's a lot of controversy around the benefits of the drug, anything that you are inhaling into your lungs that's a combustible product will certainly increase the stress on your lungs and the level of inflammation,"" he said. ""Even if it's for medical purposes, you want to be careful with anything that you're igniting and inhaling into your lungs at this point."" 
Two other potentially harmful behaviors are sitting by the fireplace or lit candles, Eitches said. This might be a bummer since both of those activities are relaxing. But similar to smoking or vaping, a fireplace -- especially a wood-burning fireplace -- ""emits smoke into the environment, which you would then inhale and then deposit into your chest,"" he said. 
Many candles have metal wicks, which are vaporized along with smoke and can cause similar lung damage. 
Exercise can improve respiratory capacity, or breathing ability. Alveoli are tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs arranged in clusters throughout the lungs. They're integral to the respiratory system, as they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the bloodstream. 
When a person is sedentary, Steele said, that results in a phenomenon called ""atelectasis,"" when the lung sacs don't have enough air and collapse slightly. To improve the lung sac capacity, people have to ""breathe against resistance,"" he added. 
""You can think of it like a partially deflated balloon,"" he suggested. ""And what's the way that you keep the air inside a balloon? You tie a knot in it to increase the resistance, so the air has to work harder to get out."" 
By breathing against resistance when exercising, you're ""actually helping to expand and keep open the air sacs"" in your lungs, Steele said. 
In addition to cardio, yoga and stretching, breathing exercises such as pursed lip breathing and deep yogic nasal breathing can help and are easy to do wherever you are, Eitches suggested. Pursed lip breathing is when you take in a deep breath with your mouth, close your lips, then exhale through them as if you're blowing up a balloon. There are similar benefits from deep yogic nasal breathing as you filter the air through your nose. 
Improving your lung function means ""you would be less likely to hit a critically low lung function state, which would in turn cause you to not be able to oxygenate your blood,"" Eitches said. 
""Respirators essentially breathe for you to try to push open your airways. These exercises will teach you how to fight off the respiratory side effects [of Covid-19] on your own."" 
Additionally, Steele said, exercise decreases inflammation in the body and can reduce the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious complication in some patients hospitalized with Covid-19. 
Reduce excess mucus buildup
""Mucus is naturally occurring in our bodies, and it provides a very important function to maintain good health in our respiratory tract,"" Steele said. ""It helps to capture [allergens, bacteria and viruses].""
In our respiratory tract, we have little hairs called cilia that move those threats out of our tract. We swallow the majority of mucus, Steele said, but when we have thingsthat irritate our nasal passages, we can produce too much mucus and be unable to clear it. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses, and blocks oxygen from entering and leaving the pathways of the lungs. 
We also have mucus in our lungs. People with asthma produce too much mucus, which can predispose them to blockages and inflammation in their airways, Steele said.
There may be a connection between diet and mucus buildup. ""Some people believe that inflammatory foods such as milk and wheat increase mucus production,"" Eitches said. ""Another school of thought that I have seen to work both anecdotally with my patients and with myself is eating spicy foods.""
Spicy foods that have capsaicin -- chiles, jalapenos, cayenne, hot sauce -- can thin mucus and allow it to be coughed out. 
There are a few methods for controlling excess mucus: You could try a saline nasal spray if you have allergies. People with asthma can use their inhalers to decrease inflammation, which reduces mucus. Taking a hot shower or boiling hot water to make a hot towel compress may also work, as the steam mixes with mucus to thin it out. 
""[Mucus] is something where if you have too little, it's bad because we can get infections,"" Steele said. ""If you have too much, it can block your ability to breathe and also increase infection. So you want just the right amount."" 
Minimize exposure to allergens
Spending more time indoors during the pandemic means we're increasingly exposed to indoor dust. And since it is now spring, there's pollen everywhere. 
Both can set off allergies and asthma, Eitches said, and we need a functioning nose to get clean air into our chest airways. 
""When you are allergic, you get swelling of the inner nose tissue and excess mucus production,"" he added. ""When you are unable to breathe from your nose, you switch from nasal breathing to mouth breathing. The lungs want warm, clean, humidified air from the nose -- the air it cannot get from the mouth.""
Managing dust via cleaning and an air filter, and managing pollen allergies with medication, can help avoid having to rub or blow your nose to open it up -- If your hands are unclean, you risk becoming infected with the virus. 
For dust, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter would help to remove the majority of allergens from the air, Steele said. Air conditioning registers also need to be cleaned. When pets go outside, wipe them off before they come in the house to rid them of any pollen. 
If people practice these techniques, they may have a milder course of illness if infected with coronavirus, Eitches said. 
""These suggestions have immediate benefit, but don't expect to see dramatic results overnight,"" he added. ""Your body will be subtly improved, and your body will be able to handle coronavirus and other infections.""
Taking steps to improve respiratory health is another tool to add to one's prevention kit, as we weather the pandemic and anticipate another possible wave in the fall. 
""The stronger your baseline health, the stronger your body will be to fight off infections,"" Eitches said. ""It's like having the appropriate ammunition to fight a war.""

Florida has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,"" and risks being the ""worst it has ever been,"" according to Wednesday's projections from a model put together by a team of scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
The state joins nine others -- Alabama, Arizona, California, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas -- that are seeing record-high seven-day averages of new coronavirus cases per day, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. 
Twenty-one states are seeing an upward trend in new coronavirus cases and health experts continue to stress the importance of taking precautions to mitigate the virus's spread. Despite the rising number of cases, the White House has downplayed the risks, with President Donald Trump saying in an interview with Gray TV on Wednesday that the virus is ""dying out.""
At the same time that the White House narrative is at odds with the data, health experts including Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci have been absent from many public updates. Dr. Johnathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN's Erin Burnett it's because ""they tell the truth.""
""And the truth is that the pandemic is still very, very active in the United States and that we're not getting back to normal and there are difficult things that the public has to do,"" Reiner said. 
According to data from Johns Hopkins University:
 21 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Oregon, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
 Eight states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah and Washington.
 21 states are seeing a downward trend: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.
 One state, Vermont, has seen a decrease of at least 50%.
Nationwide, more than 2 million people have been infected and 117,717 people have died of the virus.
Officials downplay record cases
On Wednesday, the virus claimed 755 lives in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
State officials are navigating the outbreak and managing the rising number of infections on their own.
Los Angeles County, which accounts for almost half of California's cases, on Wednesday reported another single-day high of new cases. But officials attributed the county's increase to a lag in test reports.
Other politicians have also attributed higher case numbers to increased testing, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said surges are outpacing testing.
'When you see 50% or 150% increase in the number of cases you are seeing -- which is what we are seeing across the South -- that's not testing. That's new cases. That's community spread,"" he said.
Texas also reported a record-high number of daily Covid-19 hospitalizations on Monday, with 2,326.
Florida recorded almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases also on Monday -- its highest number of new and confirmed cases in a single day, according to the Florida Department of Health.
But Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state will not shut down.
The governor attributed the spike in cases to increased testing as well as outbreaks in prisons, agricultural communities and long-term care facilities.
Alabama and Arizona join calls for mask mandates
Some local officials are hoping to manage the spread by mandating mask usage.
A day after the city council failed to pass an ordinance, Montgomery, Alabama, Mayor Steven Reed implemented an executive order Wednesday requiring those in the city to wear face masks and coverings, according to a post from the city's official Twitter account.
Arizona physicians have called upon Gov. Doug Ducey to implement a similar executive order statewide. While the governor announced Wednesday that he would be calling upon 300 National Guard soldiers to help with contact tracing, he said he would leave mask requirement decisions to mayors.
Some local leaders are unlikely to follow what he called ""a self-defeating executive order,"" he said.
Earlier this week, nine Texas mayors, including those in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have
 urged Gov. Greg Abbott to give them the authority to require masks be worn in public ""where physical distancing cannot be practiced.""
The mayors and physicians have reason to believe the requirements could be effective. A study reported Tuesday found that an estimated 230,000 to 450,000 cases of the virus were prevented in states that required mask use between April 8 and May 15.
Large events yield positive coronavirus tests
Loosening precautions and restrictions means more people are gathering in larger groups, which has in some cases swiftly resulted in positive coronavirus tests.
Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb announced Wednesday that he tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-quarantining for at least 14 days. He said it is ""likely"" that he came into contact with an infected person at a campaign event he held on Saturday. 
The county Public Health Department is working to track everyone he came into contact with, he said on Facebook.
Earlier this week, a group of 16 friends in Florida, said they all became infected with coronavirus after a night out at a recently reopened bar.
Still, Oklahoma, one of the states reporting a record-setting number of new cases, is scheduled later this week to host a campaign rally for Trump. 
When questioned, Trump said he was not worried about attendees getting sick.""Actually, Oklahoma has had a very low rate relatively speaking. It is a little spike, a small spike for a specific reason,"" he said. ""We'll go there, everyone is going to be safe.""
Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma acknowledged the rise in rates to CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday, but said the rally should not be postponed and ""we are pushing people to be attentive on this.""
CNN's Nikki Carvajal, Shelby Lin Erdman, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup, Pierre Meilhan, Jamiel Lynch, and Holly Yan contributed to this report."

He also promised to donate 5,000 ventilators to the ""international effort,"" including 1,000 for the UK.
The ventilator can be mounted on a bed, run on batteries or wall power and doesn't require a fixed air supply, according to Med-Tech News. It's also efficient in conserving oxygen and has a user interface designed specifically for healthcare providers.
Many patients with COVID-19 develop severe respiratory symptoms and can't breathe on their own, so a ventilator is essential for treatment. In countries hit hard by the pandemic like Italy and Spain, hospitals don't have enough for every critically-ill patient. With coronavirus victims flooding hospitals, that has forced doctors to essentially decide who gets to live or die.
The UK government has been criticized for its slow and disorganized response to the coronavirus crisis compared to other European nations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who just confirmed that he now has COVID-19, personally contacted James Dyson to ask for help with the ventilators. Existing ventilator makers criticized that move, with one company saying that ""the government should have given funding to existing ventilator manufacturers, and existing companies like us.""
The device still needs to be approved by UK regulators, though Dyson has pledged to help get it through as quickly as possible. On the manufacturing side, a company spokesperson told CNN that the ventilators would be ready to go by early April. ""The race is now on to get it into production,"" Dyson said."

But, in truth, we're still largely at the beginning of our experience with COVID-19. There's still so much we don't know. If you have the virus, think you have virus, or just want to know what it's like to be sick with COVID-19, there's still a hell of a lot of mystery. There's a laundry list of potential symptoms and wildly different levels of sickness, and new informations is coming out every day. 
One community on Reddit is doing its best to help provide answers or, at the very least, a space to collect firsthand experiences with the virus. The subreddit, r/COVID19positive, is a place where people with the virus talk about their experiences and ask questions of others who have had it or currently have it. It also allows people to ask questions of those who tested positive and has a dedicated thread that collects the many conversations centered on ""I Think I Have It."" 
The subreddit, which has almost 49,000 subscribers, effectively serves as a clearinghouse for the many different experiences people have had with the disease. It can be a scary place, for obvious reasons, but also an uplifting one. In one popular post from Thursday, for instance, a user who described themselves as ""a slightly fat, mildly asthmatic smoker"" updated the subreddit to share which symptoms had finally eased. 
""My throat no longer hurts, Im still more fatigued that usual but Im free of the dreaded virus now,"" the update read. ""I hope everyone is doing ok and I just wanted to pass on a positive update that even if youre not the most healthy person in the world you can overcome it, you will feel shit, youll worry, youll take a while to get over it but in most cases you will get there.""
The creator of the group, u/the1andonlyjoja, said they made the subreddit to find these sorts of stories from people who actually had the virus.
""The media was only showing stories of pandemonium in hospitals, places shutting down, and people dying,"" they wrote in a message to Mashable. ""I searched one evening to find stories of people surviving, regular people catching it, and the look of people with mild cases and couldn't find anything so I decided to create a subreddit based around first hand experiences.""  
The subreddit can be a fascinating look at how people are experiencing the virus. People describe all the different ways COVID-19 can manifest itself, such as detailed discussions about gastrointestinal issues and the timeline of all the different symptoms.
I found out about this sub last week. I came on here to see what peoples experiences have been. And fuck, everything has been terrified to read! I know its giving me more anxiety but I come to learn (I had no idea this thing could last more than 2 weeks and man, the range of symptoms people are reporting are maddening). Anyway, I am CONVINCED I have it. But everyone I try to vent to is telling me its all in my head because they know I am a hypochondriac with severe health anxiety.
To preface: the only times i leave my apartment is to walk the dogs. I only just started wearing a mask in the hallways this past week. So if I have it, it's probably from that. I also live with my husband.
Last Friday I had 4 bouts of diarrhea. Saturday normal. Sunday nothing. Monday to today normal (albeit in small amounts) BM. Stomach has felt weird on/off too, but no loose stool or diarrhea. My throat doesnt hurt but it feels sore where my adams apple is. My chest hurts mildly in the center but comes and goes. And today ever since 2pm I have felt dizzy. Ive been taking my temperature ever since my first bout of diarrhea and its been fluctuating in the 98 F range and 96 range. My normal temp (I take it a lot, like I said, hypochondriac) is usually in the 97 F range.
Im so scared things are going to get worse from here on out. Because based on what Ive read, symptoms come and go, get better and worse, and new ones arrive. So Im afraid for what later tonight and tomorrow brings. I am convinced I have it because I read a study that GI symptoms can come before the dry cough or fever. And my GI symptoms started last Friday.
Does anyone have similar experience? I am so scared. I have extreme fear of vomiting and I really dont want it to get to that point.
There are some rules to the subreddit: no medical advice, no memes, be kind, don't troll, don't fear-monger. Users' posts are tagged with flair that indicates if they had it/have it or if they are asking questions of those who did to clear up any confusion. 
There's also the obvious caveat that there is no way to definitively know if people claiming to have COVID-19 actually do (or did). U/the1andonlyjoja said they tell people to take posts at face value and to use the subreddit as just one tool, ""but if there is a suspicion of lies being told or someone is fear mongering or posting just for a reaction the mod team will discuss this individual and remove, mute or ban the poster."" 
For those coming to the subreddit for encouragement, it does appear to be a source of support for some. One person, for instance, recently posted about finding out they were positive and admitted they felt scared and guilty for possibly infecting others. Commenters rushed-in to reassure the original poster that nobody chooses to have the virus and people are mostly doing their best in a hard time. 
A Reddit user posts about how they're feeling after testing positive for COVID-19.

For an online space that deals with such a frightening thing, r/COVID19positive does seem to be a place that attempts to put things in a well, more positive, light. 
The1andonlyjoja wrote that the subreddit has helped them and other people ""know not everyone is dying, not everyone will end up on a ventilator and know that one day we will back to normal but till then we are all in this together."""

Believe it or not, professional basketball is back this week and you can watch even if you don't pay for cable.
That said, there are some things you need to know about the NBA's restart. The United States isn't even close to being out of the COVID-19 woods yet, so the league has taken some drastic measures to make sure it can crown a champion (and collect incomprehensible amounts of TV revenue) for the 2019-20 season. 
The games start on Thursday, July 30. It's weird as hell, but if you've been bored for the past five months with nothing to watch on TV, it's better than nothing.
Wait, basketball is back? How?
Fans can fill virtual stands in the NBA bubble.
Image: jim Poorten / NBAE via Getty Images
Over the weekend, you may have noticed that Major League Baseball is back. Those teams are still traveling around the country and playing in empty stadiums. Everyone is getting regularly tested for COVID-19, but more than a dozen players for the Miami Marlins alone have tested positive, then they played a game anyway, and it seems like the league could shut down again at any minute. 
That's not how the NBA is doing it. There will be no traveling or even contact with the outside world until the NBA Finals are over. Instead, players, coaches, broadcasters, referees, journalists, and all of the other people who keep the train rolling are staying in a tightly controlled ""bubble"" in Orlando, Florida on a Disney campus. Everyone is holed up across a handful of hotels, games are played in three different arenas onsite with no seating for fans, and anyone who leaves or enters is closely monitored and tested before they can interact with other humans.
The games haven't even started yet and we've already gotten a hilarious example of what happens when a player tries to break quarantine: LA Clippers guard Lou Williams will miss the first two games of the restart while quarantining because he decided to get some wings at a famous strip club in Atlanta. To be fair, the wings looked really good. 
This is an odd approach, but it's not a unique one. The NHL, WNBA, and MLS are all doing the same thing in different cities. One could and probably should argue that the U.S. doesn't deserve to bring back sports yet, but the results in the NBA's bubble so far are somewhat encouraging. The last round of COVID testing produced zero positive results. 
They put the whole league in Orlando?
To nobody's surprise, the Knicks will miss the playoffs.
Image: Nathaniel S. Butler / NBAE via Getty Images
No. While it's arguably irresponsible to play any basketball right now, it's definitely irresponsible to make the teams that were already knocked out of playoff contention before the season shut down play basketball. The NBA only sent the 22 teams that were still alive in the playoff race to Orlando and left these eight teams out:
<ul><li>Golden State Warriors
</li><li>Charlotte Hornets
</li><li>Cleveland Cavaliers
</li><li>Atlanta Hawks
</li><li>Minnesota Timberwolves
</li><li>Detroit Pistons
</li><li>New York Knicks
</li><li>Chicago Bulls
</li></ul>If your favorite team isn't on that list, then they're still playing. At one point, there were rumors of a second bubble in Chicago for the bottom-feeders because even bad teams need game revenue, but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. The world can survive without closure to the Knicks' season.
How many games are there?
This is why the NBA's playoff rules are slightly different this year.
Image: David Sherman / NBAE via Getty Images
This is where things get a little strange from a pure basketball perspective. Normally, an NBA team plays a 72-game regular season. If they have one of the eight best records in their conference by the end, they can punch a ticket to the big dance. Since the NBA didn't get to finish its regular season before the pandemic took hold, each of the 22 teams in the bubble will play eight ""seeding"" games amongst themselves to decide who gets to go to the playoffs. Their records in those games will be added to their records before the shutdown to calculate playoff seeding.
The top seven teams in each conference will go to the playoffs as normal, but there's a special rule in the restart for the eighth seeds. If the teams in eighth place in the Eastern and Western Conferences (currently the Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies) are four games or fewer ahead of the teams in ninth, there will be a best-of-two play-in tournament. That way, the ninth seed can usurp the team ahead of them and go to the playoffs instead by winning two in a row.
Does it make sense? Not really. Is it transparently a way to give rookie sensation Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans an easier path to a first-round matchup against LeBron James? Pretty much. Once the playoffs actually start, they'll be the same as usual: Three best-of-seven rounds in each conference culminating in a best-of-seven finals. If you thought you could watch all of that without navigating the confusing world of cable TV or streaming alternatives, we have bad news for you.
When and where can I watch?
Will the ""Greek Freak"" bring a trophy to Milwaukee in the bubble?
Image: Jesse D. Garrabrant / NBAE via Getty Images
The NBA restart officially begins on Thursday, July 30 with a double-header on TNT: Jazz vs. Pelicans at 6:30 p.m. ET and Clippers vs. Lakers at 9:00 p.m. ET. The playoffs tip off on Aug. 17 and the Finals start on Sept. 30. You can see the schedules for each team's seeding games here.
The majority of the seeding games will be on ESPN, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV. According to the schedule, a small handful of them will not be nationally televised and will instead air on local affiliates, like they would under normal circumstances. The easiest way for most people to watch those games will be via NBA League Pass. Right now, you can pay $28.99 for access to out-of-market games that aren't nationally televised. Using the same League Pass link, you can subscribe to just NBA TV for $6.99 per month, if you want.
For the national games that make up the majority of the seeding and the entirety of the playoff schedules, you'll need one of two things: A cable login or a subscription to a streaming alternative that has ESPN, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV. YouTube TV is going to provide the best value on its own, as $65 per month gets you all four of those networks. ""Best"" is relative here.
If you go with another service, you'll have to make compromises. Hulu with Live TV is probably the second-best option at $55 per month, as it gives you everything but NBA TV. You can just supplement that with the aforementioned NBA TV subscription. Sling Orange is just $20 per month (discounted from $30) and gets you everything except ABC. Finally, fuboTV will give you NBA TV with its $55 per month standard package plus the $6.99 per month ""Extra"" add-on package. It actually doesn't have ESPN and ABC yet, but it's supposedly getting both of those in ""early August."" No TNT on fuboTV, unfortunately.
Not great, right? It's labyrinthine and costly to watch these games without cable, to be sure. There are other, less legal ways to do it that we can't suggest to you, but you have access to Google. Oh, by the way, there's a whole other basketball league you should check out while you're at it.
What about the WNBA?
The 2018 WNBA MVP is back and the league is on notice.
Image: Stephen Gosling / NBAE via Getty Images
The NBA doesn't officially start until Thursday, but the WNBA's regular season actually started over the weekend from a bubble of its own in Bradenton, Florida. From now until Sept. 12, all 12 WNBA teams will play a 22-game regular season before starting the playoffs. It's never been easier to watch the WNBA thanks to an expanded national TV schedule, and you really need to check it out if you like basketball at all.
The games are spread across ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, CBS, CBS Sports Network, and NBA TV. Either Hulu with a separate NBA TV subscription or fuboTV's standard option with the aforementioned NBA TV add-on will work here. Both setups will run you a little bit more than $60 per month, so it isn't cheap. That said, the WNBA is in a pretty fantastic spot right now and it's well worth your time if you've never watched it before. The Seattle Storm, in particular, are very fun to watch.
WNBA has its own version of League Pass with the same local and national restrictions as the NBA's subscription plan. Unlike NBA League Pass, though, it's only $16.99 to get everything. That's a heck of a deal.
It's a bummer that watching live sports without cable is as difficult as ever, especially during a time when nobody can reasonably go to a sports bar to watch the biggest games. We here at Mashable hope you can find a cost-effective and easy way to follow both basketball leagues. It's not like you have anything else to do."

Multiple reports and information uncovered from online sleuths suggest the Twitter account @Sciencing_Bi, who claimed to be a bisexual professor of Native American descent, may have actually been fake. It appears it was the creation of BethAnn McLaughlin, the head of a group called MeTooSTEM, which aims to fight sexual harassment in scientific fields. 
In June, the account @Sciencing_Bi claimed on Twitter that her employer, Arizona State University, forced her to deliver lecturers in person in April to some 200 students, which led to her getting the coronavirus. On July 31, McLaughlin announced from her Twitter account, @McLNeuro, the @Sciencing_Bi had died from COVID-19. 
But ASU officials said it had no reports of a faculty member dying from the coronavirus and that it never employed a professor matching @Sciencing_Bi's description. The university had also closed its campus in March. 
""We have been looking into this for the last 24 hours and cannot verify any connection with the university,"" ASU spokesperson Katie Paquet told BuzzFeed News. ""We have been in touch with several deans and faculty members and no one can identify the account or who might be behind it.""
An ASU representative, meanwhile, told Gizmodo  that ""unfortunately, this appears to be a hoax.""
Meanwhile, Twitter suspended both @McLNeuro and @Sciencing_Bi, telling multiple outlets the accounts had violated its ""spam and platform manipulation policies."" All of the tweets from both accounts are no longer accessible but screenshots of some posts obviously live on. 
Incredibly sorry to say that I am no longer confident - honestly no longer believe - that @Sciencing_Bi was real. I interacted with her Twitter account frequently. She seemed very real to me and many others. Don't know what's going on, but given implications, had to say something https://t.co/VH2BiBYO21
 Michael Eisen (@mbeisen) August 2, 2020
The account @Sciencing_Bi had apparently tweeted for years about their experiences as an indigenous woman, being LGBTQ in academic circles, and, more recently, their long, drawn-out suffering from COVID-19. 
Lots of folks familiar with this particular corner of science Twitter pointed out inconsistencies with @Sciencing_Bi's stories, including (now-inaccessible) instances where they apparently used stock images to accompany apparent real-life experiences. 
At the end of June, after claiming her dean had asked her to take a DNA test to prove her ancestry, @Sciencing_Bi asked people to support her by sending donations to McLaughlins Venmo account. 
McLaughlin has denied she had created @Sciencing_Bi out of whole cloth, but did admit she had access to the account. She claimed to Gizmodo that as far as she knew @Sciencing_Bi had died of COVID-19, a fact she said she gathered via a family contact. McLaughlin reportedly declined to reveal @Sciencing_Bi's actual identity and also said she had met her in real life. 
McLaughlin told BuzzFeed News: ""Im not going to dox anyone. Thank you for your interest.""
Yet after @Sciencing_Bi's alleged death, McLaughlin seemed to suggest they were in an intimate relationship, tweeting: ""Looking at her side of the bed and crying. Just a lot of crying. I literally can do nothing.
this arc culminated in a (retrospectively) hilarious eulogy thread by bethann, in which she really wants to hammer home that she had a cool Hopi friend pic.twitter.com/PRz4Mhcysf
 aspiring leftist academic (@endlesswario) August 2, 2020
McLaughlin even held a Zoom memorial for @Sciencing_Bi, to which just five people showed up. McLaughlin was the only person who claimed to have met her offline. 
This is also not the first instance of controversy surrounding McLaughlin. A March report from Science Magazine detailed that McLaughlin, while heading MeTooSTEM, allegedly ""sidelined people of color and bullied volunteers, activists, and fellow leaders."""

An ABC News analysis.,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cdc-headquarters-gty-rc-200228_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,2020-02-29T00:36:19Z,"President Donald Trump is taking heat from Democrats for proposing budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention amid growing fears about a new coronavirus outbreak in the United States, but administration officials say CDC funding has steadily increased since Trump took office.
An ABC News analysis of the presidents budget proposals compared to the congressionally approved spending plans ultimately enacted show both claims are true.
The president introduced his fiscal year 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10, just 11 days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concerns. The spending plan included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels.
In fact, all of Trumps budget proposals have called for cuts to CDC funding, but Congress has intervened each time by passing spending bills with year-over-year increases for the CDC that Trump then signed into law.
During the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina Tuesday, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg accused the president of defunding the CDC, claiming the result is that we dont have the organization that we need.
On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted, The Trump Administration has slashed CDC funding and left positions charged with managing pandemics vacant. The budget request for Coronavirus funding shows they still dont understand the magnitude of the threat.
Asked about the criticism at a House budget hearing Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that, during the presidents tenure, every part of our preparedness and infectious disease program activity has been enhanced and expanded.
Azar went on the say the presidents budget proposals are just the jumping-off point for budget negotiations.
Budgets are like the first move in a chess game with, Ill be honest, a fairly profligate Congress, Azar said. And the president starts that move with a budget knowing that were going to get a lot higher there as we work with Congress.
As health officials gear up to confront a potential outbreak, the administration is asking Congress to authorize an additional $2.5 billion in supplemental funding for 2020 aimed at accelerating vaccine development and other containment measures. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has suggested that figure is not sufficient, and Congress should allocate an additional $8.5 billion for fighting coronavirus.
But its not just the presidents budget proposals that are under the microscope as fears of a new coronavirus outbreak mount. Bloomberg also took aim at Trump for eliminating a position from the National Security Council responsible for coordinating administration efforts to combat infectious disease.
The president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, Bloomberg said. So, there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.
In 2018, Trump administration eliminated the position of senior director for global health security and biodefense as part of a broader downsizing of the NSC spearheaded by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Earlier this month, 27 Democratic senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert OBrien urging him to reinstate the position and asking him to clarify how the White House plans to handle global health security threats.
Families concerned about the novel coronavirus threat need to know the NSC has a dedicated, senior official with appropriate expertise and authority to address the domestic and global health threats from the virus, they wrote. It is of paramount importance that this person approaches this role though a public health lens.
The senators requested a response by Feb. 27, but the NSC did meet that deadline, nor did it respond to a request for comment from ABC News.
Retired Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer held the position of senior director for global health security and biodefense on the NSC from April 2017 to July 2018. He previously coordinated the Presidents Malaria Initiative under President George W. Bush, and is now the senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
Cutbacks at that agency under the Trump administration are also receiving new scrutiny.
Last year, the USAID program known as PREDICT was shuttered. The initiative was launched in 2009 and designed to improve the detection and discovery of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. The program is credited with identifying nearly a thousand new zoonotic viruses, which are transmitted between animals and humans, and influencing the response effort currently being employed to combat the coronavirus, which is a zoonotic infection.
Earlier this month, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sent a letter to the head of USAID asking him to reinstate the program in light of the spread of coronavirus.
The current deadly viral outbreak and its quick appearance in the United States make clear that PREDICTs contributions to zoonotic disease surveillance and forecasting must continue, she wrote. We simply cannot afford to go backwards and jeopardize the success weve seen over the last ten years.
The president has defended his administrations response and preparedness efforts as incredible. On Wednesday, he tapped Vice President Mike Pence to lead a coronavirus task force formed late last month that was being led by Azar. Other members of the task force include NSA OBrien, CDC Director Robert Redfield, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci."

CNN en Español Medical Correspondent Dr. Elmer Huerta hopes to change their minds. 
More than 50% of cases of Covid-19 in the United States are African Americans or Latinos, yet they make up only 15% of participants in the first Phase III vaccine trial in the United States, co-developed by biotech company Moderna and the National Institutes of Health.
In fact, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins gave the trial a ""C"" grade for recruiting minorities.
""From the first week I saw the numbers, and they were not as encouraging as I would have liked,"" Collins told CNN.
The vaccine could be delayed if the trials don't recruit enough minorities. That's why Huerta, a longtime public health advocate, volunteered for the Phase III trial.
""When you have a clinical trial, it's extremely important for all the races and ethnicities to be represented because sometimes there are differences in toxicity and effectiveness of a medication or vaccine,"" Huerta said. 
""As a Latino I thought it was very important for me to participate.""
Huerta, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University, was elected president of the American Cancer Society in 2007, becoming the first Latino president in its history. 
He is also the founder and director of the Cancer Preventorium at the Washington Cancer Institute, and hosts several radio programs with RPP Noticias de Perú focusing on health care and more. 
Why are Black and Latinos hardest hit?
There are a number of reasons why Black and Brown communities have higher risks for catching Covid-19 and having more severe reactions that can lead to hospitalization and death.
One factor is that long-standing discrimination and social inequities can lead to limited access to health care and make those populations more likley to have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released earlier this month.
There are also structural factors, such as economic and housing policies; and social factors, such as essential worker employment status requiring in-person work, according to the CDC report. 
Black leaders agree that it's hard to recruit Black people into the vaccine trials.
""When we Black people hear 'clinical trials,' we think 'we're not going to be researched on,' and that's across economic status and across educational status, not just one sector,"" Renee Mahaffey Harris, president and CEO of The Center for Closing the Health Gap in Cincinnati, told CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.
Huerta, who takes questions on his Spanish-language podcast, ""Coronavirus: Realidad vs. ficción con Dr. Elmer Huerta,"" hopes his own efforts will make a difference. 
""Please, especially African Americans and Latinos who are underrepresented in this study, consider it,"" Huerta said. "" You are going to get your injection, you will participate, the study lasts for 25 months, and you will be helping yourself and the community.""
Half the study participants receive the real vaccine, and half get a placebo. Participants will track if they have symptoms or side effects for about two years. 
In the meantime, Huerta has some advice. 
""We want to remind you that - until we have an effective and available vaccine or medication - the use of a mask, keeping a distance of at least two meters from other people and washing your hands frequently, are the best measures to fight against infection by the new coronavirus,"" said Huerta, in a recent podcast. 
Practicing one of those safety measures should not cause the others to be neglected, he added. All are necessary to win the fight against this deadly new disease.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)The botanical product oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant, has hit the headlines because of a claim by a TV pillow pitchman that it might be an effective treatment for Covid-19.
President Donald Trump has not officially given his support (""Is it something that people are talking about very strongly? We'll look at it. We'll look at it,"" he told a reporter last week.) 
But Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and chairman of the Minnesota Trump campaign, pronounced the President ""enthusiastic"" about the unproven therapeutic. Lindell said he hoped the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would consider its approval soon if not sooner. 
The source of all the headlines is a proprietary extract of oleandrin developed by Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc., a company in San Antonio, Texas. The product has been around for almost 20 years and has been referred to by many names including Anvirzel, PBI-05204, oleandrin and ""proprietary extract of Nerium oleander,"" the moniker used in the product's first clinical trial against Covid-19 infection and the term I will use. (Because of the proprietary nature of the product, it is not possible to know if these substances are chemically similar or actually identical.)
Mr. Lindell is new to Phoenix's board of directors -- he was added last week, receiving a financial stake in the company -- and his upbeat attitude about the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander is shared by company Vice Chairman and Director Andrew Whitney who is ""100%"" behind the claim that the product cures Covid-19 in 2 days. 
Plain old oleandrin, the non-proprietary botanical product, first appeared in the medical literature in 1949 with a study of its effect on chick embryo hearts, then, five years later, as a possible treatment for human heart problems.
Many reports have focused on its considerable toxicity, which has led to accidental -- and sometimes deliberate poisonings, including for suicide. It has also poisoned animals. Consider a July 2020 article titled: ""Outbreak of Oleander (Nerium oleander) Poisoning in Dairy Cattle: Clinical and Food Safety Implications"" from the Swiss journal, Toxins.
Indeed, it is the toxicity of both the Nerium oleander plant and its extract, rather than its effectiveness, that dominates the published scientific literature, as well as a leading guide to botanicals. 
On the therapy side, published, peer-reviewed literature on oleandrin is almost all lab-based, not clinical, and careens from an initial focus on heart disease to neurologic conditions and various cancers, including melanoma, osteosarcoma (a bone cancer) and pancreatic cancer. 
The clinical experience in pancreatic cancer and ""refractory solid tumors"" includes about 100 patients, the only human recipients I have identified in the published literature. One early trial examined toxicity in 18 patients; another in 46 patients. 
Next, to examine possible effectiveness, it was studied in 42 people with advanced pancreatic cancer. In this trial, the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander demonstrated no benefit but did cause a great deal of toxicity. Per the investigators, grade three and higher ""treat-emergent adverse events"" (on a scale of one through five, where grade three is a severe adverse event and five is death) were seen in 63.2% of patients. 
Despite this, the authors, who included Dr. Robert Newman, Chief Science Officer of Phoenix Biotechnologies Inc., called the study drug ""generally well tolerated."" The drug was not developed further for treatment of this cancer. 
Another trial, registered at Clinicaltrials.gov in 2012, was to be given to patients with lung cancer at MD Anderson Cancer Center. However, the study was withdrawn; no details have been published as to why. 
Undiscouraged, Phoenix Biotechnologies, Inc., broadened its scope. The observation that the compound reaches high levels in the brain has led to consideration of its use for stroke, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as brain cancers. No clinical data has yet been published for these theoretical uses.
Oleandrin (both the proprietary extract and other formulations) also has been studied in the lab for various viral infections through the years, including HIV, hepatitis C, and possibly Marburg virus and Ebola virus. 
Most recently, though, a non-peer-reviewed lab study described the results of oleandrin (not described as the proprietary product though involving Dr. Newman of Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc.), demonstrating (like many other chemicals) suppression of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. 
Given the absence of other available information, this nonclinical work appears to be driving the enthusiasm for oleandrin among these pharmaceutical directors and executives. Whitney, of Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc., claims to have seen ""compelling"" data -- that he is unable to share, suggesting additional results are known to the company.
It's unclear whether that enthusiasm has been dampened by a recent report that the US Army Institute of Infectious Diseases conducted tests on oleandrin's effect on Covid-19, which were halted due to ""inconclusive"" results.
Without question, the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander has a much weaker argument for use to treat Covid-19 than hydroxychloroquine, which caught fire and Trump promoted after a similar non-peer-reviewed listing showing results in 20 patients. 
We have no results of the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander in human Covid-19 infection, only a sobering record of toxicity and therapeutic failure in other diseases.
Plus, as a general rule, any drug that ""shows promise"" for so many different conditions -- heart disease, stroke, Parkinson's, various cancers, HIV, hepatitis C and now Covid-19 -- probably isn't all it is cracked up to be. It's the pharmaceutical equivalent of a dilettante.
The logical and aboveboard next step is to study the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander in well-designed clinical trials. 
Unfortunately, the current human trial of the drug to treat and prevent Covid-19 that has been announced by HealthQuilt, a large primary care network in Houston, is a ""feasibility"" study with a non-randomized ""parallel assignment"" of outpatients.
This means that participants will receive either the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander or no proprietary extract of Nerium oleander. The 100 participants will include both those with proven infection and those without infection who have been recently exposed to an active case. 
Unlike any clinical trials I have been involved with or read about, this study allows participants to ""elect"" or ""not elect"" whether they want to take the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander, which in this trial will be given under the tongue four times a day for five days. 
Allowing participants to elect whether or not to receive the treatment runs counter to a bedrock principle in clinical trials: the use of randomization to remove potential bias in results. 
A spokesperson for HealthQuilt told CNN, ""This was never designed as a randomized study -- this was just a feasibility study so we can collect the data."" 
He went on to add that the company, which was looking at the extract of Nerium oleander as a supplement that could potentially boost the immune system -- not whether it was a cure or treatment for Covid-19 -- would suggest conducting a double-blind randomized study only if the data from the feasibility study supported moving forward.
No information on specific safety measures is listed and the data monitoring committee that is charged with overseeing the progress is housed at the Schull Institute, a small, private foundation in Houston founded in 2001 by geneticist Dr. Jack Schull. 
Per their website, they appear largely focused on mentoring of young leaders in science and medicine. Daniel Twiddy, vice president of the Schull Institute, told CNN that the foundation has been overseeing clinical trials and organizing institutional review boards (IRB's) since 2019. 
Another extremely unusual element of this study is that the principal investigator for the trial and CEO of HealthQuilt, Dr. Kimberly Dunn, also is listed as the president of the Schull Institute.
The approach of having the same person or group lead a study and be involved with the company tasked with monitoring the safety of that study is unprecedented in my experience, given the potential for conflict of interest.
The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has guidelines for clinical study conduct and explicitly states that a group of experts, independent of the trial investigators and others involved in the study, should periodically review the conduct and results of the trial to assure patient safety.
The HealthQuilt spokesperson said Dr. Dunn was scheduled to transfer the presidency of the Schull Institute in March, but that was delayed as a result of the coronavirus. She has recused herself from any discussion of the study from the board of directors, he told CNN, an action also noted by Mr. Twiddy.
Strictly from a study methodology perspective, this is a poorly designed trial. As a feasibility trial, it is intended to focus not on scientific rigor but rather on the practical issue of whether a study site can handle the laborious and complicated specifics of actually doing a trial. 
Meaningful information, other than feasibility, should never arise from such a study.
But the goal of the trial, I suspect, is not generation of usable clinical information but rather to get a tiny hint that suggests that maybe, just maybe, the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander can help against mild Covid-19. 
With that wispy ""endorsement,"" we are likely to see hydroxychloroquine redux, with a carnival of talking heads hawking it and fresh pressure on the FDA for some sort of approval. 
Whether the FDA caves or not under such pressure doesn't much matter. The real game here is not whether the proprietary extract of Nerium oleander actually works.
The spokesperson for HealthQuilt said, ""What anyone does with the data is out of our hands... We never intended to get political or anything else, and we're certainly not touting this as a cure or treatment, but we're just following the data and seeing where it goes from there.""
No, having witnessed the anti-regulation fervor of many of those in the administration, my concern is that they are using the Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity to peel away even more drug safety regulations, which the recent administration decision to no longer require premarket review for certain lab test has only sharpened. 
And drug approval is a great target: the scientific enterprise is a deliberately slow and cautious process that depends on cold, hard data to assure human safety.
How simple it is to miscast those who believe in science into annoying and useless fuddy-duddies moving at a rotary-dial phone pace. There are so many sick and dying people and all they want to do is study the problem (goes this thinking). 
Typical bureaucratic response! Or as Whitney says derisively, ""you know (they insist) you need to have years of studies, and you need to have this, that, and the other, and so forth."" Never mind that the administration denounced the recent Russian Covid-19 vaccine as lacking sufficient safety data.
Better to move blindly forward with the MyPillow guy in a utopian regulation-free environment where the watchword is ""what have you got to lose?"" To which I would respond, considering oleandrin's reported toxicity in humans, ""your health."""

New ARM-powered Macs could arrive in 2021
It would give Apple even more control over the platform instead of relying on Intel.
The company is reportedly planning three Mac processors based on the A14, a yet-to-be-confirmed chip that is expected to power the next iPhone. Apple will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the same firm responsible for its iPhone and iPad processors, to build the new Mac chipsets, according to Bloomberg. And, if all goes to plan, the first hardware featuring the new design will reportedly be sold next year.Continue reading.
Tesla competitor Polestar 2 will start at $59,900 in the US
The Volvo–Gheely joint venture plans to start deliveries of its first pure EV this summer.
More than a year after Polestar unveiled its stylish, all-electric Polestar 2, the company announced that the EV will cost $59,900 in the US. That isn’t exactly cheap, but it’s close enough to the Model 3’s $40,000 price to make it a solid competitor. While it's arguably better looking than the Model 3, it has similar specs. Its 78 kWh battery delivers a range of roughly 275 miles, and it packs 408 horsepower.Continue reading.

As more cases of COVID-19 appear around the world, Americans living countries such as Italy and Japan could soon see their ability to cast ballots affected, according to Democrats Abroad, the group that manages U.S. citizens voting overseas. 
While more than 82,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide and hobbled global markets, the new restrictions mark the first example of the virus impacting the 2020 election. The development comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week identified the first potential case of the virus spreading within a U.S. community and warned that cities, businesses and schools should prepare for a larger outbreak. It also comes just days before Super Tuesday, when 14 states will hold primaries and Democrats who live overseas begin casting their ballots.
Voting is often a difficult process for U.S. citizens overseas, who have typically mailed or faxed their ballots to state elections officials or submitted them electronically. But in recent years, Democrats Abroad has created in-person voting opportunities for presidential primaries by giving Democrats the option to participate in a Global Presidential Primary instead of voting with their home state. 
However, the coronavirus outbreak is eliminating that in-person option for some voters. In China, Democrats Abroad had previously planned to hold in-person voting events in Beijing and Shanghai. Those were canceled last week after local ordinances restricted travel and public events, and the State Department encouraged U.S. citizens to stay indoors, according to Democratic National Committee spokesperson Maya Hixson. Democrats Abroad said on Feb. 26 that it had also canceled in-person voting in South Korea. 
Without in-person voting, Americans overseas would normally have the options of mail, fax or email. But Democrats Abroad China said on its website that packages leaving China are at risk of being stopped, so the group recommends that voters stick with email. This means that voters will be sending their ballots as email attachments from their personal inboxes to an inbox set up by Democrats Abroad. That inbox forwards the ballots to be stored on a secure Amazon Web Services container, which has “enterprise levels of encryption and security protocols built into its infrastructure,” according to Amanda Mohar, global communications director for Democrats Abroad. 
“We want to ensure that our primary process is as secure as possible while also making it as accessible as possible,” Mohar says, adding that Democrats Abroad has a security process that limits ballot access and prevents data deletion. All emailed ballots are then reviewed by an online tally team. Mohar says that Democrats Abroad is confident in its security procedures and does not expect COVID-19 to impact ballot security in any way. 
“The most important thing to understand,” says Mohar, “is that voting is still available for voters no matter what happens.”
Still, election-security experts caution that it’s difficult to fully secure any process that involves voting over the internet. Some states do allow overseas and military voters to regularly submit ballots electronically, while others use secure web portals. The ones that use email typically acknowledge it’s not ideal. When the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report last summer about Russian election interference, it said “states should resist pushes for online voting.” 
“It is absolutely proven that you can intercept an emailed ballot and alter it,” says Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of the U.S. Vote Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that helps Americans overseas vote. “There has been no secure online voting system certified in the U.S. ever. Email isn’t a voting system, let alone secure.”
Outside of China and South Korea, the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in Iran, Italy and Japan. Italy and Japan both have in-person voting planned for next week, so Democrats Abroad are in close contact with officials on the ground there and may cancel their events if needed. 
“The feeling here in Italy on the ground is people are really quite worried. No one knows how scary it really is,” says Nancy Fina, the chair of Democrats Abroad Italy. She said she had not heard concerns from U.S. voters in Italy about emailing their ballots, and was grateful that Democrats Abroad allows people to submit ballots online. “Our number one desire is to get the vote out,” Fina says. “That is very very important for us.”

The World Health Organization reports that coronavirus pathogens can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours. In other words, we need to stop touching things and keep washing our hands. But naturally, that's easier said than done. You can't really avoid door handles, elevator buttons, or punching your PIN into the card reader at the grocery store. That's where the inspiration came from for StatGear's Hygiene Hand, which has raised more than $580,000 on Kickstarter in the last month.
We know what you're thinking this thing looks weirdly familiar. And yes, while we did indeed feature a similar product recently, it was such a hit that we went looking for alternatives. And here's the main difference: Hygiene Hand is an everyday carry tool designed by an actual NYC paramedic to help reduce the number of things you have to touch every day. Plus, unlike the extremely similar CleanKey, this one's made in the USA and will ship faster, meaning you won't have to wait as long to brave the grocery store with some added safety measures. 
Hygiene Hand is made from brass with 70% copper and features a large loop to slip your finger into for leverage. It's designed to hook onto round handles, so you can open and close doors without touching them, and also works as a stylus in place of your finger. The flat tip is safe to use on phones, ATM screens, point of sale machines, and more.
Even though the Hygiene Hand helps you live a more germ-conscious lifestyle, you should still wash your hands and wear a mask in shared spaces, as per the CDC. It's not magic, but it will make your life a little safer and healthier. Just clip it on your keychain and start navigating your way through the grocery store, bank, or pharmacy without touching things.
The Kickstarter campaign surpassed its initial $5,000 goal by an astronomical amount. Get on board and grab yourself one for just $19.99, which is 20% off retail value."

I'm talking, of course, about The Office's Michael Scott.
But before we move to Scranton, first Trump.  He really got lost in a morass of negative vs. positive when trying to explain that his health was fine.
""I tested very positively, in another sense,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""I tested positively toward negative, right? I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning: I tested negative.""
Here is a quote from Trump:
""I tested very positively in another sense so this morning. Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right. So. I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning I tested negative."" pic.twitter.com/xA0DBUcfr9
 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 21, 2020
The comments from Trump are reminiscent of Scott played by Steve Carell in the Season 2 episode of the iconic sitcom titled ""Michael's Birthday."" In the episode, accountant Kevin Malone is waiting to hear back from a doctor about whether he has skin cancer. 
Michael, ever self-centered, is frustrated that folks are lavishing attention on Kevin on his birthday. Later, at an ice-skating rink which Michael had gotten himself for his birthday Kevin gets the news that his tests came back negative. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief, except Michael. He stomps angrily, rips of his (faux) Livestrong bracelet, and tells Kev ""we're gonna beat this."" 
SEE ALSO: Which 'Office' characters would make the best quarantine buddies? We figured it out.
The scene then cuts to Michael, trying to explain away his idiocy. 
""Well, apparently, in the medicine community, negative means good,"" he tells the camera. ""Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would be chaos."" 
As Mashable's Nicole Gallucci wrote in 2018, the Scott and Trump similarities have come up pretty much since day one of his presidency. The character even had a Trump business book in his office. 
Whether it's positive or negative to have your leadership compared to Michael Gary Scott's, well that's anybody's guess."

Contact tracing is when health officials get in touch with the people whom a person who has tested positive for coronavirus has come in contact with. They then check if they are symptomatic, and often request that they self-quarantine. It's a leading method for preventing outbreaks.
We now have more information about how, in a city of 8.5 million, it will all technically work.
NYC has tapped a tech company called Twilio for the job. Twilio is a ""cloud communications"" company, which means it provides all sorts of digital communication tools behind the scenes like marketing text messages, customer service chats and calls, and status updates to other companies. You know when you get those texts about when your Uber driver is arriving? That's powered by Twilio.
The city plans to use Twilio's customizable ""flex"" program for its cloud-based contact center, which basically means it'll use Twilio's servers and software to keep track of individuals and power its communications efforts. When the city's contact tracers get in touch with someone, they'll be doing it through Twilio's text and voice platforms. 
Contact tracers will send out educational information and requests for people to self-report on their symptoms and contacts. The program, and partnership with Twilio, runs through the city's Department of Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications (DoITT). Twilio couldn't speak to how NYC specifically would use the platform, but provided a framework for what their contact tracing operation looks like. Here's their step by step explanation (edited for length and clarity by Mashable).
<ol><li>Twilio's cloud contact center gets integrated with a database of patient data. 
</li><li>A contact tracer will click into a patients record in their database to automatically trigger a call to connect them to a COVID-19 infected patient (through Twilio).
</li><li>The contact tracer will educate the patient about COVID-19 and ask them who theyve been in contact with recently who may have been exposed to the virus. Scripts vary based on the type of patient. 
</li><li>Then, the contact tracer places additional phone calls to all exposed individuals letting them know what precautions they should take now. Contact tracers do not reveal the identity of the patient who exposed these contacts.
</li><li>Once contact tracers have called patients and notified contacts, they then put the individuals in an automated set of text messages for 14 days. Patients and contacts get daily reminders via text to click through to a symptom survey where they report on how they are doing.
</li></ol>With so much sensitive health information passing through Twilio, privacy is certainly something to pay attention to. Twilio says that it is a ""non-location based, HIPAA compliant contact tracing solution."" It also clarified that ""the government agencies deploying contact tracing solutions control the collection and storage of data,"" not Twilio.
Earlier in May, the city and states of New York announced that they would hire ""thousands"" of contact tracers. Contact tracers can be people with healthcare experience, but the government is also accepting applications from people who take an online course and pass with an 85 percent or above. The Guardian reports that the course had over 150,000 enrollments in its first week, and that NYC has already had 10,000 people apply for the job.
Twilio runs the communications of some of the most prominent tech companies in the biz, including both Uber and Lyft, Airbnb, Instacart, Netflix and too many other household names to list. Since getting a functional contact tracing operation up and running in New York City is going to be a tremendous challenge, it's encouraging that the city has tapped such a major player. Now, it'll be up to New Yorkers to actually answer the phone."

With most of the city on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, it might feel like all that the city has to offer is off limits. Torontos people and businesses are resilient and creative, though. They have found innovative ways to offer their services while the city moves toward lifting restrictions. 
With things slowly beginning to open up again, including patios at 50 percent capacity, we can look forward to getting back to some of our favourite venues and activities.

Take in the beauty of Torontos parks and gardens
Torontos many parks and gardens provide a refreshing escape from the confines of your home. From the beauty of its lakes and rivers to its ravine systems and trails, there are plenty of natural attractions to see and experience in Toronto while keeping a safe social distance. 
Toronto Botanical Garden offers four acres of award-winning themed gardens adjacent to Wilket Creek, Don Valley Ravine and Edwards Gardens. Although tours and events are temporarily suspended, you can enjoy the beauty of nature and wide-open space.
High Park is a 161-hectare park along Torontos Lakeshore. It offers trails, paved roads, sidewalks and benches for a walk, a hike, a ride or to sit and enjoy the fresh air and open space all day long. The park is usually pretty quiet in the mornings but starts to pick up in the afternoon.

It can literally change lives.
From emailing medical records to dialing 911, most of us have the ability to transmit essential data right at our fingertips and one of the biggest lessons learned from past crises is that first responders rely on a dependable communications system. When communications infrastructure fails or does not exist, the results can be devastating.
A new kind of network for our first responders
In March 2017, AT&amp;T was awarded the contract to work with FirstNet, a groundbreaking public-private partnership. Together with the federal government, AT&amp;T built and deployed this nationwide broadband network for first responders. Currently, there aremore than 12,000 public safety agencies and organizations
 subscribed to the dedicated communications platform, accounting for some 1.3 million connections in service.
Now in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&amp;T has continued to rise to the challenge of providing crucial connectivity for pop-up testing centers, medical command centers, and local police and fire departments, among other essential services in greatly accelerated time frames.
During the first three months of 2020, in one major city alone, a team of AT&amp;T retail store managers and in-home care experts were able to activate hundreds of mobile WiFi hotspots to FirstNet customers in less than six hours . It feels great to know that AT&amp;T is directly working with first responders to help provide them with the necessary tools during this time, said Juan Munoz, an AT&amp;T store manager.
COVID-19 and the fight to stay connected
In the nations hardest hit city, FirstNet hashelped orchestrate Governor Cuomos COVID-19 response plan
, stepping in to help ensure EMS and other first responders had connectivity required for transporting patients between facilities and helping marshal the hundreds of mutual-aid ambulances entering the city. To keep track, all ambulances were equipped with FirstNet Ready Sonim XP8 smart devices with AT&amp;T Enhanced Push-to-Talk (EPTT
) functionality.
For those on the frontlines, AT&amp;Ts high-speed communications platform has taken on a critical role in the present public health emergency. Then, there is the impact on everyday learning.
This pandemic has taught us that connectivity is both a lifeline in literal terms for medical workers and first responders and the underpinning pipeline of the current normal that were all living today, explains AT&amp;T Business CEO Anne Chow in arecent blog post
. In virtual classrooms perched at kitchen tables and bedroom desks around the country, AT&amp;T is working to support remote learning through initiatives for parents, caregivers, and students.
Next up: Helping students and schools across the country
The company has expanded itsAccess from AT&amp;T
 program providing internet for $10 a month to limited-income households, while offering two months of free service for new customers. They have also increased eligibility to households participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and Head Start. 
For teachers and education-focused small businesses, AT&amp;T has provided funding for distance-learning solutions. Among those ed-tech startups, which previously participated in the companys Aspire Accelerator, areBoddle

There's been depressing and relatable memes about Zoom fatigue and losing all concept of time, and now, thanks to Reese Witherspoon, a new 2020 mood meme is making the rounds on Twitter.
The meme, which I refer to as a ""2020 Mood of the Month Forecast,"" shows a grid of nine photos. Each photo is labeled with a month of the year, and in the photos get increasingly more dramatic as time passes.
The January photo is all well and good. The February photo shows a spark of concern. And from March to September, everything visibly goes downhill. (It's unclear why the meme ends after September, but we're hoping it's not a sign that the world will be ending before October.)
Here's Witherspoon's meme, which features photos from her various movies and TV shows.

After Witherspoon tweeted her emotional forecast, her pals Mindy Kaling and Kerry Washington jumped on board, and it wasn't long before the format began to trend. Though some people have started making their own personal versions of the meme, others are creating ones inspired by their favorite actors, TV shows, or movie characters.
Go forth and meme your 2020, everyone. It's a small and silly coping method, sure, but at least it will distract you for a few minutes."

It's a kind of hygienic vigilance that LG's new Tone Free wireless earbuds are tailor-made for, thanks to one timely, new feature.
You see, these AirPods alternatives have a UV light in the charging case that LG claims will kill bacteria and germs while the buds charge. (When I said timely, I meant timely.) That's a neat hook, to be sure, but LG's new earbuds also have to actually work as earbuds to make the $149.99 investment worthwhile. 
So are LG's Tone Free earbuds the future of wireless earbuds, a gimmicky mess, or something in between? Let's find out together.
First, that germ-killing UV feature...
The most eye-catching thing about the new Tone Free earbuds is the claim that its charging case can kill up to 99.9 percent of bacteria on the speaker mesh using UV lights. 
First, you need to know that this feature only activates when you put the earbuds inside the case while the case is plugged in and charging. This feature doesn't work on the go, presumably, to maintain the advertised 12 extra hours of battery inside the charging case.
This UV feature also isn't meant to clean visible earwax or other gunk off of the earbuds. You'll have to do that yourself. Instead, it's meant to kill microscopic germs and bacteria that I was not equipped to observe during the review period. So I can't judge its effectiveness in that sense, but Dr. Amesh Adalja from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security gave a blunt assessment of the general usefulness of this type of feature.
I wouldnt necessarily buy a UV earbud if it cost more money,"" Adalja said. ""I dont think that this is a major risk for infection.
Cleansing UV light
Image: lg
UV radiation is used to neutralize bacteria in places like hospitals, but that doesn't mean it's going to save your life with a pair of ""clean"" earbuds. COVID-19, in particular, is a respiratory illness that transmits through the mouth and nose more than the ear. In other words, while LG's device may do its job to some extent, there are too many other factors at play, as well as easier cleaning solutions to make UV sanitization the sole selling point of these earbuds.
We know that UV radiation is not ironclad because its affected by the temperature, its affected by the different types of pathogens, its affected by wavelengths,"" Adalja said. ""If youre borrowing someones earbuds and youre freaked out by their earwax, just wipe it off with [alcohol].""
So now, with that out of the way, let's talk about how LG's buds actually work as, well, earbuds.
The Good: Comfortable, noise-isolating, and accommodating
There are more important things to consider about a pair of earbuds than just their appearance, but you can't pretend like that doesn't matter. You don't want to look like a goober walking around with something goofy sticking out of your ears. Right away, LG's new Tone Free earbuds make a nice first impression with sleek looks and ace comfort.
At the risk of sounding reductive, the model LG sent me looks like matte black AirPods, but with the kind of silicone ear tips you would find on AirPods Pro or, well, most other earbuds. There's also a glossy white model, if that's your thing. Either way, anyone who has ever used Apple's AirPods can take solace in the familiar here. That means you'll have a little stem peeking out from your ears when you wear LG's earbuds.
I didn't have any AirPods Pro on hand for a direct comparison during my review period, but the Tone Free earbuds are more comfortable than regular AirPods by a decent margin. The silicone ear tips kept them securely in my ears in a way the default AirPods never did when I used them regularly. That snug fit combines nicely with an overall excellent level of comfort. You'll barely notice these while they're in your ears.
You may be wondering about noise cancellation (or at least reduction), considering that's becoming more standard in wireless earbuds over time. LG didn't pack active noise cancellation of any kind into these earbuds, but the silicone tips actually do a pretty good job of keeping outside noise where it belongs. The first time I took these out on a walk around the neighborhood, I could've sworn there was active noise cancellation at work. 
There isn't, but that's fine, in this case.
Image: lg
My actual favorite thing about the Tone Free earbuds is the accompanying mobile app. It's available on both iOS and Android, and it's the only way to adjust settings for the earbuds. Unlike some of the super basic earbuds apps we've seen recently (looking at you, Microsoft), there's a lot to like here. It's got a litany of toggles and sliders to play with, so you can customize these earbuds to your liking.
By default, touch panels on the earbuds can play or pause with a single touch, adjust volume with two touches, or skip tracks with three. A long press turns on ambient sound mode, which we'll get to shortly. You can remap the double and triple taps to do things like rewind or take voice commands from Siri using the app. And you can remap those commands on both earbuds.
The app also comes with four different sound equalizer settings for different listening experiences, as well as two slots for custom equalizer builds. You can lock the touch panels, adjust ambient sound, and even make each individual earbud play a loud noise in case you lose one. I'm not a huge fan of using apps to change settings on headphones in general, but if it has to happen, all apps should be as comprehensive as this one.
The Bad: Weak bass, unpleasant ambient sound mode
You may have noticed I haven't really addressed sound quality when talking about the good parts of the Tone Free earbuds. It's not bad by any means, but LG's earbuds don't pack much of a punch in the audio department.
The main issue is the underwhelming bass output. You can tweak this some using the app's equalizer settings, but even the ""Bass Boost"" mode is weak. It simply doesn't slap the way it should. The overall audio output is passable, but it never crosses into a territory beyond that. It's perfectly fine for going on a walk or run. But if I'm stationary, I want something with a little more kick to it.
Black AirPods or LG's new buds?
Image: lg
The only other real knock I have against these buds is the ambient sound mode. It's activated by a long press on either earbud's touch panel, and basically all it does is use the onboard microphones to amplify sound around you when you aren't playing a song or podcast. To be perfectly clear: This does not affect audio quality during playback. It's just when you pause.
At its default setting, it sounds like you're listening to a too-loud and crunchy audio recording of your immediate surroundings. It's like having a hidden mic in your head. I know I complimented the ear tips' noise reduction earlier, but they don't do such a great job that you can't hear the world around you when you pause your favorite song. You can adjust the ambient noise mode using a slider in the mobile app, but you're probably better off just never using it.
The Competition
In terms of price, the closest direct competitor for the new Tone Free earbuds would be Apple's regular AirPods. Those start at $159.99, but don't have silicone tips for comfort or a UV light in the charging case for disinfection. That said, Apple's buds don't skimp on sound quality.
LG isn't the only company making wireless earbuds that come with a UV light to blast away bacteria, but the competition isn't especially fierce, at least not in the U.S. The Tronsmart Onyx Free wireless earbuds are a budget model with UV sterilization, while the Philips ActionFit earbuds with UV cleaning are about $160. 
You might be better off getting a standalone UV cleaning kit for all of your devices, but be warned that it won't be especially cheap. UV sterilization devices like this $125 one from Link can easily cross the triple-digit price barrier. In this sense, what LG is selling is a pretty good value.
The Verdict
LG's newest offering is a pretty standard pair of earbuds that only sound OK and don't have much in the way of unique playback features. They're certainly handsome, comfortable, and accommodating thanks to a mobile app with an impressive number of customization options. Plus, even without active noise cancellation, they do a pretty great job of drowning out unwanted noise. But not so much that you should be tempted to use the included ambient noise mode.
The fact that the charging case claims to purge germs from the speakers with UV light is the only unique selling point here. But as we covered earlier, that feature might bring you more peace of mind than tangible results. Even if that feature may not be a literal life-saver, the fact that these still cost less than the cheapest AirPods means it doesn't really matter.
They may not do much to separate themselves from the competition aside from putting a bacteria-killing light in the case, but LG's Tone Free earbuds have enough going for them that they're worth putting on any affordable wireless earbuds shopping list."

Toward the end of the discussion with restaurant executives and other members of the industry, the president casually dropped that he's been taking the drug (which is used to treat malaria, lupus, and arthritis) for ""about a week and a half."" 
""I'm still here,"" he continued.
When pressed on whether there was evidence that taking the drug has a preventative effect, Trump said he's received ""a lot of positive calls about it.""   
He also dismissed recent studies that concluded that hydroxychloroquine wasn't an effective COVID-19 treatment. 
One, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, studied 1,438 COVID-19 patients across 25 New York hospitals. That study concluded that among hospitalized patients, using the drug ""was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality."" Another observational study published by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center followed 1,376 coronavirus patients at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and similarly concluded that ""the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower"" among those who received the treatment than those who did not. 
Trump claimed that the patients who were treated using hydroxychloroquine didn't experience better results or any, for that matter were already in ""extraordinarily bad condition."" 
Whether he's actually taking the drug or just said he was to get a rise out of reporters remains to be seen. Trump and other right-wing pundits have been pushing hydroxychloroquine use for weeks, and desperate Americans have been buying up the country's supply. Those who do need the drug to treat autoimmune conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are struggling to access it.

Taking the drug can cause dizziness, nausea, hair loss, and ringing in the ears. More serious side effects include uncontrolled movement, loss of balance, and, in severe cases, seizures.

It isn't the first time Cuomo has been inspired by antique political art. His office commissioned an inexplicably nautical-themed poster in January to celebrate...himself. Highlights included the octopus of intolerance and ""The Squalls of Hate."" 
I just really want to make sure that people taking in Cuomo's NYS COVID poster today aren't sleeping on his previous NYS politics poster, which is the superior artwork because of the Kraken labelled ""Intolerance."" pic.twitter.com/2wZ6ec87W2

But why does Cuomo keep commissioning mythological posters of himself? What's with this thing for 19th century art? What, exactly, is a Boyfriend Cliff?

It's the simplest, cheapest, most effective and straightforward piece of advice health experts are handing out in the face of a novel coronavirus outbreak that's rapidly circling the globe.
So far, more than 83,000 people have come down with the new viral illness caused by the coronavirus, called COVID-19. The sickness prompts symptoms including a fever, dry cough, and in severe cases, trouble breathing and death.
Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed so far are in China, where the virus originated last year. But in recent days, the number of cases being tallied around the world has soared, just as the rate of new infections in China tumbles, prompting concerns that a widespread pandemic could be on the horizon, if measures to contain the virus around the world fail. 
Public health experts still consider basic health and hygiene measures the best defense against COVID-19
""You've heard about washing hands,"" Dr. Sherlita Amler, an adjunct professor of public health at New York Medical College and Commissioner of Health in Westchester County, said recently at a coronavirus conference. 
""If I could teach one thing to the public that would prevent most of the diseases that I have to deal with, it would be wash your hands.""
Officials at the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agree, and have said much the same in recent days and weeks. Regular handwashing is linked to all kinds of great health outcomes, like fewer norovirus cases, fewer deaths, and happier, more diarrhea-free trips to the bathroom down the road. It's also one of the best ways, health experts say, to keep yourself healthy during the coronavirus outbreak. 
As it turns out, though, women say they are heeding this piece of public health advice in significantly greater numbers than men — at least in the US.
According to an Insider Data poll, conducted in online surveys on Thursday, a significantly higher number of women reported they're washing their hands and keeping surfaces clean to ward off COVID-19. 
Specifically, when 1,051 poll respondents were asked: ""What steps, if any, have you taken to prepare for a possible coronavirus outbreak in the US?"" 382 women (65% of those who were asked) said they were ""washing hands and keeping surfaces clean."" Only 243 of the men asked said the same (52.7%). 
That statistically significant poll finding lines up with what other scientists have discovered before. 
Men don't wash their hands as much as women, even though they should
""People who use urinals probably think they don't need to wash their hands,"" Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, previously told the New York Times.
But handwashing experts say that's a bogus idea. 
""It doesn't matter whether you're peeing or you're pooping, you should wash your hands,"" Don Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers who has been studying handwashing for years, previously told Business Insider. ""I think a good general rule of thumb is you should wash your hands any time you feel that they might be dirty."" 
That advice becomes even more important during an infectious disease outbreak. 
The most common way COVID-19 is spread is through person-to-person contact. Regular handwashing, along with keeping a safe distance from others who might be sick (that's about six feet) as well as judiciously avoiding touching your face, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth, are some of the greatest things you can do to stay healthy right now.
Wash your hands for 20 seconds, and scrub them well
Lather up.

Regular, vigorous, and proper handwashing should include soap, water, and last for around 20 seconds. That is long enough to hum ""Happy Birthday to You"" about twice in your head (or out loud, if you like), and it can really make a difference in stopping the spread of all kinds of infectious diseases. 
Regular handwashing cuts down your risk of infection dramatically
Since the 1800s, health care professionals have known good hand hygiene is linked to lower infection rates. It was in the 1840s that Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that when doctors and medical students handled cadavers before touching patients in the maternity ward, more mothers developed fevers and even died. He instituted an unpopular chlorine-washing rule and saw the death rates there tumble.
Similarly, during the Crimean War, nurse Florence Nightingale initiated handwashing rules and other hygiene measures in the British hospital where she worked. Death rates there dropped by two-thirds, providing some of the first hard evidence that proper hygiene saves lives.
Today, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate better handwashing could cut diarrhea death rates in half, and save more than a million lives (adults and children) every year. Regular hand washing can also cut your risk of developing a respiratory infection by 16%.
Pathogens like novel coronavirus droplets can get deposited on surfaces, including doorknobs, elevator buttons, toilet handles, phones, and store counters, which we all touch with our hands and fingers, often before we reach for our faces and mouths. (In the survey, women also said they're wiping down those hard surfaces more often than men are, which lines up with data from The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development: women around the world tend to spend around three hours a day doing unpaid work, while men do just about half that.) 
Even a little more handwashing, especially while we're traveling, could really help.
One 2019 study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Risk Analysis, suggested that simply ""increasing travelers engagement with hand hygiene at all airports"" could reduce the impact of a pandemic by anywhere from 24% to 69%. (The study authors estimated that — at most — only about a quarter of people in airports at any given time clean their hands.) It's certainly not the first evidence we have that handwashing really works, though.
So what are you waiting for? Scrub up already.

It also wanted to offer future users “peace of mind” knowing that they and their packages would be safe.
Ford COO Jim Farley warned during the earnings call that the pandemic could influence society for “many years to come,” with people seeking out more ways to avoid unnecessary human contact. Chief executive Jim Hackett cited what happened in China as an example, noting that a third of car sales moved online as a result of the pandemic.

In a blog post, VP and engineer Tim Bray, who worked at the company for five years, said he ""quit in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19."" He went on to describe the firing as ""chickenshit."" 
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment for this article.
If you haven't been following the drama, Amazon fired two workers who spoke out about the company's warehouse conditions during the coronavirus outbreak. 
The UX designers, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, took to Twitter last month to talk about the ""lack of safe and sanitary working conditions"" for warehouse workers. Very shortly after, the workers were fired for ""repeatedly violating internal policies.""
That same month, CNN reported that three warehouse workers were also fired for speaking out about their working conditions. 
Bray mentioned in his blog post that ""firing whistleblowers isn't just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink the poison."" 
""It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.""
And, while he said that company is now prioritizing warehouse safety, he stressed that he believed the workers who spoke out, saying that ""Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that's not just Amazon, it's how 21st-century capitalism is done.""
SEE ALSO: I canceled my Amazon Prime membership. You can, too.
He also emphasized the difference in how Amazon treats its warehouse workers and corporate employees. 
Bray described Amazon Web Services (where he worked) as an ""ethical organization"" that treats its workers humanely and pushes them to find work-life balance, among other perks such as higher pay.
Meanwhile, warehouse workers are ""treated like crap,"" partly because healthcare in the U.S. is tied to employment. 
According to Bray, legal guardrails achieved through ""antitrust and living-wage and worker empowerment legislation"" are necessary to end the exploitation of workers."

In the course of planning these meetings, I made clear to the two people I shepherded through the House that, with the news surrounding coronavirus and some members going into self-quarantine, these were not normal times in the Capitol -- the buildings would be empty compared to a typical congressional workday and that handshaking would likely be at a minimum.
From the very beginning, entering the Capitol, it appeared as business as usual. Congressional staff, Capitol support staff, security and reporters covering Congress were everywhere. There was no shortage of tourists. Indeed, the Capitol Rotunda was jammed with tour groups. In the Cannon, Longworth and Russell House buildings, as well as one of the House cafeterias, there were plenty of people, whether those who work in the Capitol or those just visiting.
Outside of the House Chamber during votes, the number of people -- Members of Congress, reporters hoping to get quotes, security and visitors like myself -- was overwhelming. Ducking into the House Republican Cloakroom -- essentially a small, private waiting room connected to the House Chamber -- I found that a room I had not visited in five years was familiarly claustrophobic, with members and staff bumping into each other like the old magnetic football table top game of the 1970s. And peeking onto the House floor, the chaotic scramble of people huddled closely, laughing, shaking hands, patting each other on the back -- touching each other, that thing we're not supposed to do! -- was like any other Congressional vote series.
What did all of these encounters have in common? Close human interaction. The awkward, ""wait, we should elbow bump"" happened, but this was the exception. Much more frequent, almost always, there were handshakes followed by a joking, ""\We should not have been doing that."" At one member's office, a sign was posted declaring the office a handshake-free zone. My hand was not shook. I got a hug. Ugh. But just like the handshakes, a hug -- something I didn't think about until I was already doing it -- is a natural and instinctive thing to do. 
Fortunately, hand sanitizer was plentiful everywhere I went and used as often as possible.
Later that day, I joked to friends about how normal everything seemed in the Capitol. But times have changed very quickly. By all accounts, the Capitol complex is now less crowded. All tours have been canceled, staff presence has been reduced, and news outlets have taken steps to protect reporters. Social distancing is happening. But as the Washington Post's Paul Kane noted, there simply is no mechanism for having the House vote remotely, which would be needed to do the people's business while emptying the Capitol. (Lawmakers are introducing legislation that would allow Congress to vote remotely.) 
The sad reality: Expect more members of Congress to test positive, and with that, more self-quarantining. Congress is just too social a place -- and politicians are social animals by nature -- for its members not to be personally affected."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)New York state reached a tragic milestone this week: It now has more Covid-19 patients than any country in the world, aside from the United States.
The state's total of 181,026 cases, as of April 11, is higher than Spain's (161,852 cases) and Italy's (152,271), countries with populations many times larger than New York.
The disease is killing New Yorkers disproportionately. Of the 20,389 deaths in the United States, 8,627, or 42%, have occurred in New York. Its mortality rate is 4.7%, compared with 3.4% in the rest of the country, according to CNN's figures based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. 
New York City and its suburban counties Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland are responsible for 93% of the statewide case count. Furthermore, in New York City, the Covid-19 death rate is about 6% higher than most countries. 
Why does New York seem to be having a different epidemic from most other parts of the country? 
Is the reason simply population size and density? New York is by far the nation's most populous city, with more than 8 million people, twice as many as Los Angeles. But New York also has eight or nine times more cases than any other city so what gives? No other city or county has a fraction of the cases of New York City. 
A caution on numbers: Counting cases and mortality rates is difficult because most counting is done by county or borough or parish rather than city, and city of residence may differ from city of diagnosis or death. Even so, New York City is off the charts. 
How about population density? Covid-19 spreads most easily when people are packed together in churches or cruise ships, in outdoor events like concerts or Mardi Gras, or perhaps in small apartments with multiple roommates or large families. New York's population density, about 27,000 people per square mile, is easily the highest in the country, though it's nowhere near the top for cities across the globe. Many cities in Asia, for example have a density of nearly 40,000 people per square mile.
The density explanation may explain some of the difference, but not all of it. New York's densest borough is Manhattan, while relatively sprawling Queens sits at fourth out of five. But Queens has more than twice the cases and twice the rate of cases as Manhattan.
Maybe it's because so much testing is being done in New York. If you test more, you find more, and if you find more, you test even more. It is likely that more tests, and more tests per population, are performed in New York than elsewhere in the United States, and that the New York rate stacks up favorably to countries with aggressive testing programs, such as Iceland and South Korea and Germany, but comparative information is sketchy. The split between tests performed by public versus private labs has made accurate tracking just about impossible, despite the heroic efforts of such groups as Covidtracking.com, Worldometers, and Our World in Data.
Furthermore, the current advice stay home if you are sick but stable and don't be tested introduces additional uncertainty. This pales in comparison to the clear evidence of deaths at home likely due to Covid-19 but never diagnosed. So yes, New York City probably is testing at a brisker pace than elsewhere and yes, this may contribute to the high case numbers, but we will never have an accurate picture.
The high number of cases and rates likely do derive in some modest amount to each explanation above plus the fact that the epidemic has been in New York City a week or two longer than many other places. A more mature epidemic is always a larger epidemic.
More concerning is the elevated mortality rate in New York City. As has been well documented, some of this is due to the tragic overwhelming of the city's hospitals. We will never know just how many people died due to the country's inept preparation for the pandemic, but the impact surely was, and still is, substantial. 
Still, a mortality rate of about 6% is quite high, even though most countries, particularly in western Europe, have seen mortality rates rise as the pandemic drags on. As patients who have hung on for weeks have begun to die, and the rate of new cases has slowed, this tilts the proportion of fatal cases. 
New York City also has had a very male outbreak; substantially more men have been diagnosed, hospitalized and have died, in keeping with data seen in other countries.
Sadly, the likeliest explanation for the high death rate, though, is the chronically inadequate health care given to minorities and the poor throughout New York City, as in the rest of the country. New York City and New York state have only now released the race distribution of cases and deaths, as well as by zip code, a surrogate for poverty rates. It is clear that severe disease has not been distributed equally by race and ethnicity. 
Black and Hispanic New Yorkers represent 51% of the city's population, yet account for 62% of Covid-19 deaths. They have twice the rate of death compared with whites, when adjusted for age. This likely is due to both a higher proportion of black and Hispanic New Yorkers being diagnosed with severe disease and a higher rate of death among those who are known to be infected.
This disparity likely is the result of several factors. Co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are strongly associated with death from Covid-19 and are more common in black and Hispanic communities. But what causes high rates of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes? Lack of appropriate health care. People who cannot easily find good health care for reasons of money, time, location, or trust may be more likely to stay at home undiagnosed and spread the virus as well as experience potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment.
The explanation is the same for New York City as for Italy, New Orleans and probably Iran: the virus exploits weaknesses in health and health care, be it advanced age or co-morbidity or access to care. 
Hopefully, the Covid-19 pandemic will force us to reckon honestly with the many shortfalls that have been exposed and build a fair, forward-thinking approach that allows doctors and nurses to care for people in need. Failure to do this will only further darken the memory of those who have died and the hearts of those who remain."

Please note that there is much we still don’t know about the new virus, and you should reach out to your own healthcare provider with any personal health concerns. 
  
What are good ways to maintain your mental health? 
I would recommend the following: 
1. Maintain a normal schedule if possible 
2. Exercise (go for walk or run, do an online video) 
3. Maintain social connections via FaceTime, Skype or phone calls 
4. Limit time spent on the Internet and connected to the news 
5. Have “virtual” dates with family and friends. 
  Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Heres how its affecting young minds (here) and how millennials are adjusting to isolation (here) . 
How long will the U.S. really have to be on lockdown to successfully flatten the curve? 
We’re still learning on a daily basis what the case count looks like in the U.S. We also need to consider that there could be a resurgence of cases once public health measures are loosened up.  
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
I defer to the epidemiologists here, but National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci recently said that he’s confident in a range of four to six weeks to 3 months.   
 Dr. Angela Rasmussen, virologist at Columbia University  
  
Do I actually need to wear a mask? 
The WHO advises that if youre healthy, you need to wear a mask only when caring for an infected person or if youre coughing, sneezing or showing symptoms. More here (here) 
  
Is it fair to assume every American will be exposed to the coronavirus this year? 
No, which is one of the reasons we have these current public health measures in place. We are trying to prevent further onward transmission of the disease. 
  Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Almost 100,000 cases have been reported in the U.S. and its territories, according to a Reuters tally of state and local government sources, mapped here. (here) 
  
Is the coronavirus airborne in normal settings and if so, for how long? 
According to our knowledge, it does not stay in the air in normal settings. Most evidence directs us to droplet transmission. Airborne precautions are required only for healthcare workers when undertaking aerosol producing procedures such as bronchoscopy/intubation.  
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Is there potential exposure in elevators?  
Coronavirus guidelines by the CDC are based on the fact that the virus is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets, like a cough or sneeze. In droplet form, it’s airborne for a few seconds, but is only able to travel a short distance. In elevators, social distancing measures should be implemented with a max number of people inside at a time.  
 Infectious Diseases Society of America 
  
How worried should we be about fomite transmission? 
We are still learning about fomite transmission. We know from an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that the virus is viable up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.  
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Can you spread the virus if you’re asymptomatic? 
Yes, but it isn’t the main driver of transmission. This is also why it is extremely important to ensure you have washed hands before touching your face. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
What’s the typical timeline of symptoms?  
From the time of exposure to symptoms it may take on average three to six days, which may be longer/shorter in some patients. Typically it starts with fever, dry cough, myalgia and flu-like illness, then progresses to shortness of breath and pneumonia in some patients.  
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Is it possible that an infected person only has a mild cold before recovering? 
Yes. The most common symptoms a person will have are fever, dry cough and muscle aches/fatigue. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Should people be more concerned about eye protection? 
We certainly use face shields to protect our eyes when in contact with patients.  
 Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease researcher and scientist  
  
Does getting vaccines increase your risk? 
Getting any vaccines would not increase your risk for COVID-19. We’re recommending getting needed vaccines. We want people to get their influenza vaccines so they don’t end up with the flu and in the hospital. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Do people have a natural immunity to this virus? 
I am not aware of “natural immunity” since it is a new virus. We might find as serology testing is rolled out that people have been exposed and developed antibodies without having symptoms. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Is it possible to get reinfected? 
We’re not sure how immunity works or how long it lasts. The best guess is that people who are infected are likely to be protected over the short-to-medium term. We don’t know about longer yet.   
 Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief, New England Journal of Medicine  
  
There are a handful of cases of possible reinfection in recovered patients. (here) But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. 
  
Is there a team working on an antibody test for the virus? If so, when might it be ready? 
There are teams working on serological tests (here). Rolling out on a population scale will be an essential part of the long-term answer, but we need to get through the next month. 
  Bill Hanage, associate professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health 
  
When will a vaccine be ready? 
Vaccine trials may take as long as 12 months. There are multiple clinical trials looking at different treatment options, but we currently don’t know whether this combination is effective and safe for patients. 
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Scientists in Singapore are trying to fast-track the process. (here) 
  
What impact will warmer weather have on the spread? 
I have yet to see convincing evidence on this, one way or the other. We are all hoping transmission will slow down with warmer weather in the northern hemisphere, and that warmer countries will be spared the worst. Not enough data yet to conclude. 
 Dr. Suerie Moon, director of research at the Global Health Centre 
  
Heres what we know about seasonal features of disease outbreaks. (here) 
  
I’ve seen several news sources report that experts from Johns Hopkins and other medical colleges are saying the virus can become less deadly as it spreads. Can you explain this phenomenon?  
Yes, one theory for why many viruses become weaker over time is that viruses that kill their host don’t get very far. This pattern of weakening is seen with flu viruses, and many others, but not all. We’re not there yet with the current outbreak. Whether it’s weaker three or 10 years from now doesn’t change anything about today’s situation.

Microsoft's Bing team has built a tracker for COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, located at www.bing.com/covid. 
The site, launched Sunday, features a live map and tracks total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as cases per country. Click on a country and you'll get more information about the virus outbreak there, with numbers of active/recovered/fatal cases, as well as news and videos. For the U.S., you'll also get a breakdown of confirmed cases per state. 
The site doesn't offer anything significantly different from similar trackers we've seen Johns Hopkins university's live map is still one of the best resources out there but it's fast, clean and mobile friendly. Also, the ""News"" tab for individual countries currently doesn't show anything.

The site was a team effort from Microsoft Bing employees working from home, and the data comes from sources such as the the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
On Monday, Alphabet's Verily launched a coronavirus screening website for the Santa Clara and San Mateo counties in California. Verily is a ""sister company"" to Google (both companies are subsidiaries of Alphabet) that's focused on life sciences and healthcare. 
Verily's coronavirus screening website is currently limited to two counties in California.

The launch follows remarks from President Donald Trump that Google is building a coronavirus test site, which seemed to have caught Google by surprise. 
The website is an ""online screener based on guidelines from public health officials,"" which will help people learn whether they qualify for testing through Verily's program. And while the site is currently very limited in scope, Verily says it's ""working to rapidly expand testing.""
""The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsoms office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks,"" Verily said in a blog post on its website.
To be eligible for the screener, users must be U.S. residents aged 18 or older, with a Google Account, and they must be willing to share health information with Google. 
The coronavirus has so far killed more than 6,500 and infected more than 169,661 people. The outbreak has been worsening in the U.S. in recent weeks, with more than 3,400 confirmed cases and 65 deaths."

As you keep up to date on the latest updates concerning the novel coronavirus, which the World Health Organization has now declared a pandemic, this simple advice stands. 
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention already has useful tips on how to wash your hands, which you should be diligently following, alongside the World Health Organization's advice for the public. 
Online, though, some people have shared their own advice. And even if you already consider yourself a handwashing expert, there's something for everyone in these fun tips going around, amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus.
For kids: 
Shared by ABC News, this six-year-old explains the handwashing advice that he learned from his doctor as a coronavirus prevention tactic. 
For each stage of the handwashing cycle, he shares some kid-friendly techniques.
For families: 
Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the TODAY Show, shared a video on her Instagram of her and her daughter singing and dancing to a made-up song that Guthrie hopes, per her caption, can help in ""making corona less scary for little ones."" 
Sample lyrics? ""We do a little dance, and we scrub our little hands. We get soap under our nails. What's it called? The corona shuffle!""

For Sailor Moon fans: 
In addition to hand washing advice, this Sailor Moon themed graphic, created by Instagram user @marcoalbieroart, breaks down all the basics for fighting coronavirus. 
For teachers: 
Good Morning America reported that a teacher in Missouri designed a simple hack to check whether or not kids have been washing their hands thoroughly enough, which she shared on Facebook: In the morning, she stamped their hands. If the stamp was gone by the end of the day, after careful handwashing, students got a prize. 
To Good Morning America, the teacher, Shauna Woods, spoke about the success of her tactic: ""Let's be honest, some student's biggest worry is if they'll get to recess on time. Providing a visual reminder and incentive has boosted their hygiene regiment. I even joined in on the fun and put a stamp on my hand to be their positive role model."" 
For lullaby lovers: 
In addition to using that viral handwashing generator, you can add another musical addition to your handwashing repertoire: Instagram user @lucyknisley shared a handwashing song to be sung to the tune of Frère Jacques. (And you can download a printable poster of the song here.) 
At the end of the day, the message is clear: Just wash your hands."

The video-sharing app is home to everything from viral anthems about being bored in the house (and in the house, bored) to quarantine-friendly workouts. 
Now, TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet company, ByteDance, is taking it a big step further with a big contribution to relief efforts aimed at the unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19. 
In a statement published on the social media company's website on April 9, TikTok President Alex Zhu announced that the company would donate $375 million to COVID-19 relief efforts. 
""The TikTok community is uplifting one another, caring for one another, and lending a hand to one another,"" Zhu said in the statement. ""We want to magnify all we are seeing across our community and translate it into concrete relief for those most affected by this crisis."" 
The majority of the company's contribution, $250 million, will be going to front-line medical workers, educational efforts, and community relief programs. 
Of that, $150 million will go to ""medical staffing, supplies, and hardship relief for health care workers,"" including a partnership with the CDC Foundation to contribute $15 million for surge staffing within local response efforts. TikTok says $40 million will go to local organizations that reflect TikTok's ""user communities,"" which includes ""musicians, artists, nurses, educators, and families,"" according to the statement. 
The donations will be spread globally, but will be given primarily to local organizations such as After-School All-Stars and MusiCares in the U.S., according to a statement from a TikTok spokesperson we received via email.
""In an emergency, speed saves lives, and we are extremely grateful to TikTok for stepping forward to support surge staffing that is needed to meet rapidly emerging demands identified by state and local health departments,"" Judy Monroe, president and CEO of the CDC Foundation, said, according to the statement.
An additional $10 million will be allotted for matching TikTok user donations, while another $50 million will support the ""TikTok Creative Learning Fund,"" through grants to educators, professional experts, and nonprofits focused on distance-learning.  
The company is also donating $100 million in ad credits to small and media-sized businesses ""to help companies get back on their feet once economies are able to restart normal activity,"" per Zhu's statement. (Pending the decisions of public health authorities on restarting business operations, the program will start its rollout in the coming months.)

Additionally, TikTok is providing $25 million ""in prominent in-feed ad space"" for NGOs, trusted health sources, and local authorities in order to allow them an avenue for informing the public on the importance of safety measures like social distancing. 
This has some precedent: Previously, the social media company partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to combat misinformation swirling around COVID-19. TikTok also donated $10 million to the WHO Solidarity Response Fund.
The TikTok spokesperson told Mashable that the company will be sharing ""many more"" details about the donations in the coming weeks."

""We are temporarily suspending the $5 admission fee to use our restroom facilities,"" Goodwin wrote, joking about the notorious game strategy to up park profits by decreasing attendee happiness. ""We hope that customers will use the free bathroom to wash their hands regularly throughout their stay at our park."" 
Other ""safety measures"" include adding disinfectant to the water in the log flume ride, seating every other car in the ferris wheel, and taking the ""necessary action of picking up and drowning any park patrons who show signs"" of symptoms. 
""We will also keep the rollercoaster that shoots straight up open, so that if customers wish to die at our park they can do so of their own volition,"" the statement continues. 
On the plus side, the park's food stands will provide students with a free ice cream cone to offset the financial stress for families that need to feed their children during school hours only with a valid student ID, of course. 
""We will be offering a 75 percent refund on already purchased tickets if you no longer feel comfortable joining us at the park,"" the statement concluded. 
And after all of those generous measures, who wouldn't want to visit? 
Goodwin's precautions may be harsh, but considering an Equinox employee recently tested positive for COVID-19 and the gym still isn't shutting down its nationwide locations, the fictional amusement park might be doing something right!"

Study suggests possible coronavirus link to type 1 diabetes 
A small study in Britain suggests researchers should be on the look-out over whether COVID-19 increases the risk of type 1 diabetes. Cases of type 1 diabetes among children may have risen during the peak of Britain's COVID-19 outbreak, scientists said on Monday in the Diabetes Care journal in a study based on 30 cases at two hospitals. In comparison with a typical year, this represented an 80% increase, they said. ""When we investigated further, some of these children had active coronavirus or had previously been exposed to the virus,"" study co-author Karen Logan of St. Mary's Hospital in London said. In type 1 diabetes - once known as juvenile diabetes - insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed, preventing the body from producing enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. The researchers said one explanation could be that the novel coronavirus might attack insulin-making cells in the pancreas. ""More research is needed to establish whether there is a definitive link ... but in the meantime we hope clinicians will be mindful of this,"" Logan said. (bit.ly/3gg2q8O; reut.rs/2YgEhZQ) 
Breath test screening for COVID-19 shows early promise 
It may be possible someday to screen large populations for COVID-19 using breath tests, researchers said. Their new breathalyzer device has sensors made of gold nanoparticles linked to specially selected molecules that can detect disease-specific chemical biomarkers from exhaled breath, they reported on Tuesday in the journal ACS Nano. In a pilot study in Wuhan, China in March, a team of Chinese and Israeli researchers tested the device in 49 COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls and 33 people with non-COVID lung infections. In this small study, the device showed 100% sensitivity for identifying patients with COVID-19 and for distinguishing them from patients with other lung infections but was less effective at correctly identifying those without COVID-19. The researchers said their device is not intended to replace gold-standard diagnostic tests, but if its reliability can be proven in larger studies it might be useful ""for rapid large population screening in a short period of time"" in public places such as airports, shopping centers and train stations or in the community, for early detection of the disease in asymptomatic contagious people. (bit.ly/3j0Jqgx) 
Smell and taste loss differ with COVID-19 versus colds 
The smell and taste impairments associated with the novel coronavirus differ from what people experience with a cold and is likely linked with nerve damage, a new study suggests. Researchers gave smell and taste tests to 10 COVID-19 patients, 10 people with bad colds and 10 healthy people. Unlike people with colds, COVID-19 patients could breathe freely and did not tend to have a runny or blocked nose. Furthermore, they could not detect bitter or sweet tastes, and they had more severe taste impairment overall. The original SARS virus, which caused a global respiratory disease outbreak in 2003, can enter the brain, the researchers noted in a report on Wednesday in the journal Rhinology, and they said their new findings lend weight to the hypothesis that COVID-19 also infects the brain and central nervous system. ""It is particularly interesting that COVID-19 seems to particularly affect sweet and bitter taste receptors, because these are known to play an important role in innate immunity,"" study co-author Carl Philpott of the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School in Britain said in a statement. ""More research is needed to see whether genetic variation in people's bitter and sweet taste receptors might predispose them to COVID-19."" (bit.ly/2En6TZZ) 
Blood-vessel cells break off in severe COVID-19 
Blood clots, a well-known complication of COVID-19, are at least partially due to damage to the endothelium, or blood vessel lining, researchers have suspected. Now a study confirms that severe COVID-19 is linked with ""marked and widespread"" injury to blood vessels, with high numbers of cells that usually comprise blood-vessel linings becoming detached and found circulating in the blood. As reported on Wednesday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, researchers in France measured levels of so-called circulating endothelial cells detached from injured vessels in 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Levels were significantly higher in patients in intensive care units and were correlated with patients' levels of inflammatory proteins, illness severity scores and length of hospitalization. The researchers tested each patient's blood only once, so they could not discern how injuries to blood vessel linings might evolve as the illness worsens. Still, they said, the blood vessel lining plays key roles in maintaining vascular stability and function, delivering blood to organs and regulating blood clotting, and any endothelial injury would impair those functions.

""Your grandma,"" Dench said, when Jamal asked who sent the messages.

Hinton did show up to Dench's family Thanksgiving, and every year since for the past four years. Dench's family became close with Hinton's, and they started a tradition of celebrating together. 
Last week, Hinton tweeted that both Wanda and her husband Lonnie tested positive for COVID-19, of which there are more than 400,000 confirmed cases in the United States. Lonnie was hospitalized for pneumonia, one of the severe side effects caused by the coronavirus. Hinton asked his followers to ""send words of love and encouragement.""

She had beaten the novel coronavirus but she couldn't get dressed by herself or even raise her arms to brush her hair.
""By the grace of God I was able to get off (the ventilator),"" said the 69-year-old woman from Lorain, Ohio.
Villareal is among thousands of people who have survived after contracting Covid-19. As of Thursday, estimates indicate that more than 710,000 people have recovered from Covid-19 worldwide, according to data collected by John Hopkins University. The actual figure is likely to be higher because the data cover only confirmed cases.
The survivors are old and young, celebrities, health care workers, faith leaders and parents. They battled the virus while hospitalized or isolated at home and were able to make it through.
Here's what people on the other side of the pandemic are doing:
They are learning how to breathe and walk again
Jesse Vanderhoof could barely move with a walker around his home in Blaine County, Idaho, and going to his upstairs bedroom was out of the question.
For the 40-year-old nurse, the skiing and hiking trips with his wife feel like distant memories. Ten days after leaving the hospital, walking only a couple of blocks leaves him extremely exhausted. 
""You want to talk about humbling and challenging for a man, that's as tough as it gets right there,"" Vanderhoof said of his week on a ventilator after he contracted coronavirus while working on Covid-19 testing tents.
Vanderhoof's wife, Emily, said she's slept on the floor while he slept on the couch to help him walk to the bathroom at night and has seen him battle the ""ICU delirium,"" an acute brain condition particularly common in patients who are sedated and on a ventilator for extended periods of time.
""He didn't understand why the world was at war with (Covid-19), why health care workers were heroes, why he was involved,"" Emily, 34, said. ""We had the same conversation for four days straight.""
Some survivors, such as David Lat, say one of their biggest challenges has been learning ""how to breathe again"" after spending 17 days in a New York hospital and six days on a ventilator. 
""It's not happily ever after, but it's better than the alternative,"" the lawyer and founder of the blog ""Above the Law"" told CNN.
The ventilator may have caused some damage to his vocal chords, Lat says, noting his hoarse voice, but ""I wouldn't be here without it.""
Leah Blomberg's muscles are weak after being in a medically-induced coma and on a ventilator for nine days. She says she feels lucky to be alive, but what used to be a 15-minute shower now takes her 45 minutes.
""The recovery is probably the worst,"" Blomberg said. ""Basically it's having to learn to walk again, because your muscles ... it's like you've never used them before.""
For those who were not hospitalized, the recovery at home can vary. Some say the process is not immediate and it has taken them weeks to recover their stamina, while others say it takes from days to weeks to get past the fever.
They are reuniting with their families 
When Sandra Sandoli embraced her husband and daughters, it was a hug like no other. It was their own Easter Sunday miracle.
""I cried. It was a hug of relief and happiness but also of sadness for all we are all going through now. So many emotions at once,"" said Sandoli, 52, a retired teacher in Fair Haven, New Jersey. 
For more than a month, Sandoli was quarantined in her bedroom after falling ill while visiting her parents in Delaware and testing positive for Covid-19. She couldn't see her parents, who contracted the virus through her, or comfort her two daughters who flew home from college.
They would leave her meals and tea by the door and pick up the empty dishes, wearing a mask and gloves, by the end of the day. They'd talk over the phone with her or while standing in different rooms.
Sandoli overcame the fever and regained her strength but a lingering cough worried her. Afraid of the virus and unable to get tested again, Sandoli said she and her doctor decided she would wait indefinitely until the cough was gone.
Sandoli left her bedroom Sunday and reunited with her family. They walked side by side for a few miles.
""It felt a little surreal,"" she said. ""The simplest thing like taking a walk was the biggest deal.""
They cooked and sat together at their dinner table eating fish, mashed potatoes and vegetables. They took a Zumba class online together.
""When I hugged my daughters, I didn't want it to end. I will never take those hugs for granted,"" Sandoli added. ""We made it.""
They are actively helping others 
Nicole Chayet and her husband have been knocking on stranger's doors around New York and bringing them bags full of groceries and essentials for the past week. 
""I want to help others. I survived the virus and I feel strong,"" Chayet, 33, told CNN. ""I'm not afraid of going outside to help other people.""
When Chayet, director of media relations for the New York City Football Club, and her husband were ill, she said she was afraid of telling other people or even asking others to take care of their 22-month-old daughter while they recovered.
Now, they are splitting their time between working from home, connecting with people suffering from coronavirus or their relatives, and trying to help others.
Earlier this week, Chayet gave a blood sample to a study conducted by Mount Sinai Hospital, aiming to use antibodies to treat coronavirus patients. She said she wants to volunteer in more studies and has since received messages from people in states as far away as Arizona and California asking whether she could find a way to help their loved ones.
Other survivors are mobilizing, donating blood or planning to help as soon as they make a full recovery.
Diana Berrent, a photographer in Port Washington, New York, who recovered from Covid-19, created Survivor Corps, a Facebook group aimed at helping people post and find research and donation opportunities for survivors. The group now has more than 30,000 members. 
""I'd like to think of it as a superhero -- me and all the other survivors have these internally-built hazmat suits,"" Berrent told CNN.
Even Vanderhoof, the nurse in Idaho who is still slowly trying to regain his stamina, is looking forward to getting back to work -- even if he doesn't know when that would be possible.
""If I've learned anything in this experience with medical problems, it's that I want to help people more than I ever have before,"" Vanderhoof said. 
What has been one of his most vulnerable times has become motivation for Vanderhoof to keep living and ultimately defend others from the pandemic.

It was Obama and other administrations, he said, who left the shelves of the nation's Strategic National Stockpile bare of the items needed to combat the coronavirus. 
To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration did use and then failed to replace items from the stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic. 
But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said.
The President's criticism also ignored a key point: The stockpile was never intended -- or funded -- to be a panacea for a pandemic. Rather, it serves as one piece of the overall supply chain puzzle during a disaster.
The stockpile's inadequacies quickly came to light in the coronavirus pandemic -- a devastating health crisis that experts have long predicted. Trump delayed striking deals with the private sector and invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to produce more medical supplies, making a bad situation worse. And states -- bidding against one another and other countries for supplies at sharp markups -- turned to the quick relief of the stockpile, only to find it understocked and the federal stewards overseeing it in disarray.
The picture was complicated even further when a whistleblower alleged this week that the system of deciding what to put in the stockpile had been corrupted by outside lobbyists and politically driven decision-making, rather than science. 
""People who somehow believed it was a bottomless pit filled with everything they can imagine were not paying attention,"" said Tara O'Toole, a physician and former Department of Homeland Security official who once chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile.
If politicians were surprised to discover that, ""then shame on them,"" she said.
Asked about why his administration hadn't replenished the bare cupboards he complained about, Trump suggested in an interview aired Tuesday that he was too busy dealing with scandalsthe President called them ""hoaxes""that have marred the first three years of his administration.
""Well, I'll be honest with you,"" Trump told ABC News Anchor David Muir. ""I (had) a lot of things going on.""
'The difference between life and death'
States quickly realized the stockpile wasn't going to be their savior.
The federal government assured Illinois hundreds of thousands of N95 respirator masks were on the way, Illinois Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell said. But when the trucks arrived, the masks turned out to be surgical masks -- insufficient protection for the health care workers treating patients with the devastating virus.
The difference in the masks is ""the difference between life and death,"" for frontline health care workers, Mitchell said. ""What we have gotten out of the Strategic National Stockpile has not been what we were promised or what we were owed.""
Similar complaints popped up across the country. Some states questioned whether supplies were being distributed equitably. Others reported receiving supplies that had passed their expiration date, had deteriorated or were not properly maintained. 
When California received 170 ventilators from the federal stockpile that were not in working condition, it enlisted Bloom Energy, which normally produces clean energy fuel cells, to help refurbish the machines.
""The only feedback we had was, 'These ventilators are not working,'"" Bloom's chief operations officer Susan Brennan said.
The ventilators had never been used but they also hadn't been prepped and preventative maintenance had not been performed, Brennan said. Bloom's team replaced batteries, calibrated oxygen settings, tested air flows and turned the rehabbed ventilators around in about 24 hours.
There were also maintenance issues with the remaining supplies in the stockpile. The government held 10,000 ventilators in reserve in anticipation of a surge in the coronavirus, Trump said in April. But about 20% of those ventilators were not in shape to be deployed because of a lapse in the government contract to keep the machines maintained, a source familiar with the matter said. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said, ""All ventilators deployed from the SNS are in operating condition and maintained based on the original manufacturer's specifications outlined in the service manual.""
The HHS inspector general announced last month it would conduct an audit of whether the stockpile was effectively managed during the coronavirus crisis.
""We've always reviewed aspects of the Department's planning and response to emergencies,"" a spokesperson for the inspector general said. ""In this case, however, the ongoing public health crisis prompted this review."" 
Greg Burel likened his job as director of the Strategic National Stockpile to managing a Home Depot for disasters. He kept track of some $8 billion worth of supplies and oversaw an annual budget in the hundreds of millions.
Despite his national security clearance ending with his retirement in January, a related non-disclosure agreement prevents him from saying much more about the secretive national stash he supervised for nearly 13-years. 
He won't say precisely how many facilities there are -- that's classified -- or what exactly is in them -- also classified.
""We keep it pretty much under wraps. The reason we do that is so a determined enemy can't figure out how to do something bad to us,"" Burel explained. ""If somebody knows what's in it, they can say, 'Well, if they can take care of the zombie apocalypse, but they can't take care of something else, well, we'll do the something else.'""
Still, bits and pieces of the stockpile's history can be gleaned from congressional testimony, government websites and obscure publications such as the Domestic Preparedness Journal, in which Burel wrote a three-part series on the SNS shortly before his retirement.
The stockpile was created in 1999 amid fears of a bioterrorism attack coinciding with the Y2K computer switch over. Dubbed the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile at the time, the idea was to establish and maintain a sufficient supply of medicine and medical equipment in strategic locations around the US to be able to quickly help state and local communities in the wake of an attack with agents such as anthrax, smallpox, plague or other pathogens.
That Y2K attack never came. But the stockpile was tapped following another disaster soon thereafter: On September 11, 2001, planes delivering stockpile supplies to New York City were the only flights allowed in American skies other than military aircraft and Air Force One.
In the wake of 9/11, the stockpile was given its current name: Strategic National Stockpile. It was used again in the early 2000s in response to a series of anthrax attacks around the US and ultimately supplied with enough medication to treat up to 12 million people.
In the years since the SNS has been used in response to a variety of disasters, from outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and botulism to flooding and 10 major hurricanes, including Katrina, Sandy and Maria.
The event most comparable to the Covid-19 crisis was in 2009, when the SNS was used to fortify the response to the H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic. In 2003, under the George W. Bush administration, Burel said it had begun stockpiling massive quantities of antiviral medication and supplies in anticipation of pandemic influenza. It marked the first departure from its original mission of preparing for a terrorist attack.
When H1N1 hit, the stockpile unleashed its largest deployment ever -- millions of drugs, masks and other protective gear for health workers across all 50 states.
Those supplies were never replenished, partly because Congress declined the Obama administration's repeated requests to increase funding.
Burel said the normally low-profile SNS has received more attention in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis than at any point in its history.
One problem with all that attention, he said, is that ""everybody then infers that it was supposed to be the place to get anything and everything you need for any kind of health care event. But the reality is it was never designed for that. And it was never funded for that.""
Enough supplies? 'Well, of course not' 
It wasn't a secret that the US didn't have adequate supplies on hand to fight a pandemic. Experts had been telling politicians as much for years. The warnings continued into the Trump administration before the pandemic, which transferred management of the SNS away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to another arm of HHS.
Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response who is now in charge of the stockpile, prioritized preparing for a bioterrorism attack over a naturally occurring pandemic, he said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.
Still, he warned a congressional panel in December that ""supply chain issues are among the most significant challenges to preparing for an influenza pandemic as well as other infectious diseases."" 
Kadlec testified America depended on overseas production for everything from gloves to pharmaceuticals.
""In a pandemic environment, this dependence could become a matter of national security, as we witnessed during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009,"" Kadlec said.
When HHS Secretary Alex Azar appeared before lawmakers in February seeking additional funding to combat the coronavirus, senators asked what was already available in the stockpile.
Azar told them there were masks and ventilators on hand.
Asked whether there were enough, he responded, ""Well, of course not. ...This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge globally, and will require additional measures."" 
'It's supposed to be our stockpile'
Disappointing returns from the stockpile and an overall erratic federal response had already shaken states' confidence in the administration.
When Kushner, the President's senior adviser and son-in-law, was charged with working on the supply chain, it initially inspired a sigh of relief, according to several government agency sources. 
The idea of a point person seemed a step in the right direction after officials with HHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent a month sorting out their respective roles in ramping production of personal protective equipment and tests needed for the Covid-19 response.
But enthusiasm quickly faded as it became clear that Kushner's involvement was adding more confusion to the already chaotic response, one source said.
Appearing in the briefing room in early April, Kushner claimed, ""The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile; it's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.""
Kushner's assessment flew in the face of the official definition of the stockpile from its website. 
The language was quickly changed a day after Kushner's statement to skew closer to his interpretation. 
Officials across the country were gobsmacked.
For Illinois, it was another sign they were on their own to replenish critical medical supplies. It left the state in a ""Lord of the Flies"" battle for supplies against other states and countries, Mitchell said.
""If I am successful in procuring a mask, an N95 mask for a health care worker in the state of Illinois, that very often may mean that there's a health care worker in Wisconsin or Michigan or Georgia or California who now does not have an N95 mask,"" Mitchell said. ""We have been pitted against each other in a way that's literally going to cost us lives that could have been saved and that is on the White House.""
Mitchell said he's also concerned states could be left on their own -- fighting in an international bidding war -- to acquire a life-saving vaccine, once one becomes available.
""Based on what we've seen, it's not a crazy scenario,"" he said.
The HHS spokesperson said the stockpile is not responsible for distributing the vaccine but the ""SNS is working now with federal and commercial supply chain partners to ensure ancillary supplies such as needles and syringes are produced and available in adequate quantities for a nationwide vaccination campaign once a vaccine is made available.""
""When I took this over, it was an empty box,"" the President said in a March briefing. ""And I'm not just blaming President Obama. You go long before that.""
During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the stockpile distributed 12.5 million antiviral regiments, 19.6 million pieces of PPE and 85.1 million N95 masks, according to a 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 
The Obama administration didn't replace those supplies, nor did the Trump administration take the initiative to do so until it found itself in the midst of a global pandemic.
The US needed 3.5 billion N95 respirator masks for a ""severe event,"" HHS' Kadlec told the Senate in March. There were only 12 million in the stockpile, Azar said in February, along with another 5 million N95s he believed were past their expiration date.
It took weeks of politicians and health care workers openly begging for supplies before Trump flipped the switch on the DPA and launched public-private partnerships aimed at easing the shortages.
Months before the administration ramped up production, at least one major mask-maker was reaching out to the federal government warning that shortages were imminent. But Kadlec and others ignored the mask-maker's repeated offers to ramp up production, according to the whistleblower complaint filed by Dr. Rick Bright, a top HHS official and one of Kadlec's deputies.
When the administration finally struck production deals, it would take even longer for American manufacturers, who have shifted so much production overseas, to build out production capacity in the US.
When Moldex-Metric, the second-largest disposable respiratory mask-maker in the US, secured a major mask-making contract with HHS, it also began pursuing ways to add equipment and production lines.
""There's only so much capacity to make these in the United States. Most of the manufacturers here have their plants, and we can run them 24/7 and hit capacity,"" James Hornstein, general counsel for Moldex-Metric, said last month. After H1N1, ""no one came to us and said we want you to ramp up your automated manufacturing lines, so you can make more when you turn on the switch."" 
The failure to keep American cupboards stocked with crucial medical supplies stretches back across administration and across party lines.
Public health and national security experts say politicians have consistently failed to treat public health issues, such as emerging infectious diseases, and the fragile supply chain surrounding them as a serious national security threat.
Pointing fingers over the stockpile ""is the politicians diverting from the fact that they were basically negligent,"" O'Toole said. 
Lucrative contracts based on political connections'
In the whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday, Bright said the stockpile's mission had been compromised by politics well before it began making headlines in connection with the coronavirus.
Bright was involved in procuring medicines and other material for the SNS and said he was pressured ""to award lucrative contracts based on political connections and cronyism.""
Bright, who was reassigned from his role as the director of the Biomedical and Advanced Research Development Authority, said that pressure included an ""outsized role"" played by a pharmaceutical industry consultant who represented a company whose CEO purportedly had ties to Kushner.
Bright's complaint details Kadlec's alleged efforts to steer contracts to companies represented by the industry consultant with whom he had ""a long standing connection."" 
In one case, Kadlec directed $40 million to SNS to fund a drug that expert advisers deemed ""inferior"" to alternatives, according to the complaint. In another case that was the subject of an inspector generation investigation, a $55 million contract was awarded -- over the objection of expert advisers -- to a company the consultant represented, Bright's complaint alleges.
Bright's allegations mirror concerns raised by Tom Frieden, who served as director of the CDC under Obama.
In interview with CNN last month, Frieden lamented what he called the ""misguided, politicized and corrupt"" transfer of the SNS away from the CDC to Kadlec's office in late 2018.
Other experts on the stockpile supported the change, but Frieden said the change ushered in a new standard for how the SNS did business.
""The basis for decisions used to be how to save the most lives"" he said. ""Now, it's how to satisfy the most lobbyists.""
Kadlec could not be reached for comment about Bright's complaint. A statement released by HHS after it was filed on Tuesday did not offer a detailed response to the document.
A stockpile '10 times' bigger
There are signs the administration is already rethinking how to prepare the stockpile for the next disaster. Congress allocated $16 billion in one of the coronavirus relief packages to bolster the stockpile with supplies like masks, respirators and pharmaceuticals. 
Trump has vowed: ""We're building up our stockpile again like crazy."" And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the US needs ""bigger and better insurance policies.""
""So we are going to look at stockpiles that are probably 10 times as big,"" Navarro said last week on a visit to a General Motors plant making ventilators. 
Despite the assurances, a FEMA spokesperson said, ""As of right now, there is no effort being made to replenish the stockpile. Inventory that is available is being used to fill urgent needs of the states to help mitigate PPE burn rates.""
Experts are skeptical that a stockpile of any size can adequately prepare the US unless there are other changes, including more domestic manufacturing of medical supplies and a commitment from hospitals to keep more protective equipment on hand.
""We cannot stockpile our way out of these situations no matter how big the stockpile,"" O'Toole said. ""We took our eye off the ball in allowing our entire supply chain to move to other countries."" 
Navarro said the administration was also ""going to think differently about how the stockpiles actually exist,"" which might include ensuring American manufacturers have reserve capacity they can quickly bring online in a crisis. 
As for Burel, he's watching the crisis unfold from his new perch as the president of a consulting firm. He left his post as stockpile director on January 3, 2020, a retirement date he says he had planned since shortly after he began working for the government as an intern.
Had he known further in advance that Covid-19 was coming, he said, ""I would have delayed everything.""
From the sidelines, he said he hopes that this crisis leads to a permanent increase in its funding rather than a one-time infusion. 
""If the country wants the SNS to be the savior for these kinds of things,"" Burel told CNN, ""it's gonna have to tell Congress to fund it."" 
The price tag for that, he said, would be in the billions annually.

""This pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing. A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge,"" the 44th President said during a virtual commencement address for historically black colleges and universities. 
""If the world is going to get better, it's going to be up to you,"" he added.
CNN previously reported that Obama had criticized the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus crisis as ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private phone call with former staffers and administration alums. Obama did not reference President Donald Trump by name on Saturday.
During his message to the HBCU graduates, Obama also spoke of how the pandemic has disproportionately affected black communities. 
""A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country. We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities,"" he said during the ""Show Me Your Walk"" virtual commencement program.
""Just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning. Injustice like this isn't new,"" Obama said, referring to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a young black man in Georgia.
Obama, who was a former civil rights lawyer and community organizer before he ran for political office, also gave three pieces of advice for the graduating class to ""create change.""
""No generation has been better positioned to be warriors for justice and remake the world,"" Obama said.
He encouraged the HBCU graduates to organize at the grassroots level (and not just resort to online activism), to grow allies in the fight for a common cause, and remember ""you're all role models now, whether you like it or not.""

Infants may be at a higher risk for severe forms of the disease, compared to older children, according to the CDC. But the data is still pretty limited, and what scientists know about these infections is based on a handful of case reports.
The CDC said babies are most likely exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets from their mom or from other caregivers or visitors. There are some limited reports that they may be exposed to the virus right before or even during labor, but the science on that is still unclear, the federal agency said.
Since there is still limited information about how frequently these cases occur, doctors should presume such newborns have an infection. These newborns should be isolated from other healthy newborns and they should temporarily be kept separate from their mothers to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. If the mother's test results are negative, the CDC says the temporary separation can end.
It's unclear when the optimal time to test is, but the CDC suggests they first be tested 24 hours after they are born and if the test is negative, doctors should test them again the next day. In parts of the country where available testing is limited, the CDC recommends these newborns should be prioritized. Newborns don't need a negative test to be discharged from the hospital.
If infants do become infected, some of the Covid-19 symptoms are similar to what doctors have seen with adult patients -- fever, cough, breathing problems and stomach issues like diarrhea and vomiting. Infants may also appear lethargic. The CDC says the extent to which a Covid-19 infection contributed to these symptoms is still unclear, though, since these same symptoms can also be seen commonly in infants for other reasons.
Much like with older children, the majority of infants who have tested positive for Covid-19 tend to be asymptomatic, or they have a mild form of the disease and recover without complication, according to the CDC. There have, however, been some cases where the infant had to be put on a ventilator.
If there isn't room to separate a mother with an infection from the child, the CDC suggests the mother use a face mask and practice good hand hygiene. The CDC does not recommend masks for any child under the age of 2. 
Healthcare providers should use protective clothing and masks when handling the infants."

In April, the Black Hawk CountyHealth Department linked the Waterloo Tyson plant to 182 of the county's 374 Covid-19 cases before Tyson temporarily shut the place down and tested its 2,800 staff members for the deadly virus.
The plant reopened on May 7. The Tyson employee who died Monday was diagnosed with coronavirus in April, according to a friend and a family member. 
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of any Tyson team member and are keeping the family in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time,"" a Tyson spokesperson told CNN Business via email Tuesday.
The Tyson employee who died has been identified as Jose Ayala, 44, according to his bother, Art Hernandez, and Zach Medhaug, who says he was Ayala's friend and co-worker at the Tyson plant.
Medhaug, who told CNN Business he too was diagnosed with Covid-19 in late April, has been chronicling the Tyson Waterloo plant's Covid-19 outbreak on Facebook and providing updates on Ayala's condition since March.
""I was with him in his final moments,"" Medhaug said of Ayala on Tuesday. ""You don't think you're going to go to work and see your friend and less than a week later, he's going to be on a ventilator and a couple months later, you're going to be holding his hands in his last minutes.""
Hernandez said his brother was a ""homebody"" and an avid gamer who loved ""Diablo"" and ""Call of Duty.""
""He was very down-to-earth,"" Hernandez said. ""He would help out a lot of people and never expected anything in return.""
Medhaug said he and Ayala became friends shortly after Ayala moved to Waterloo from Laredo, Texas, six years ago to work at the Tyson plant, where Medhaug has also worked for the past 11 years. His loved ones said Ayala had three siblings and a large extended family. 
""Jose is a good man,"" Medhaug wrote in a Facebook post. ""He is an amazing friend. He could always make everyone in the room smile. He would do anything for anyone.""
Medhaug said he himself suffered from minor symptoms before a doctor diagnosed him with Covid-19 on April 20, but Ayala had suffered from labored breathing, fever, exhaustion and a cough since late March. 
Ayala wasn't tested until after he was put on a medical ventilator on April 12, according to Medhaug and Hernandez.
""At that point he had moved to a high-risk status,"" Medhaug said of Ayala. ""Since they needed to move him on a ventilator, they needed to know what they were treating him for, so he was tested.""
Medhaug said he is convinced he and his friend caught the virus at work. ""There's no where else we could have got sick from,"" he said.
Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation that Medhaug and Ayala were infected on the job. 
In an earlier email, the company said the health and safety of its team members is its top priority.
""We take this responsibility very seriously, and we have put in place a host of protective steps at our facilities that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing COVID-19,"" the company said."

It took less than two months for the pandemic to put the family-run shop in Washington, DC, out of business. 
At first, owner Dianna Finisecy, who goes by Dee Dee, felt she should stay open, but reduce hours to limit her and her workers' exposure to customers. The shop, which shared a building with a hospital, was frequented by doctors and nurses, but business still slowed and she wasn't bringing in enough to make rent. Finisecy closed for good at the end of April, bringing some frames home with her and calling up 1-800-Junk to pick up the rest. ""It's an awful way to go,"" she said.
It wasn't until May, more than a week after Finisecy shut her doors for the last time, that she was finally approved for a forgivable relief loan from the government's Paycheck Protection Program. She used it to pay off her March and April rent as well her employees' full salaries, like she was supposed to -- and now, with the shop gone, she's worried she might wind up having to pay it back. 
""I'd hate to go out after 50 years and have that monkey on my back,"" Finisecy said. 
Slow to reach the people who needed it most
That wasn't how things were supposed to go for small business owners in the pandemic. Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in March as part of its sweeping $2.2 trillion economic stimulus response to get money quickly into the hands of small business owners. It's doled out more than 4 million loans worth $512 billion over the past seven weeks and has saved 50 million jobs, according to the Treasury Department. 
But it was slow to reach small companieslike Wagner Opticians as big businesses, like Shake Shack and the LA Lakers, got money first. Plus, there are restrictions on how the money can be spent that are making it hard for some business owners to even use the money while they remain shut down. 
The loans are forgivable if 75% of the money is used on payroll within an eight week period -- a controversial time frame that both Republicans and Democrats have expressed support to change. It may have been reasonable in March when it was hard to imagine cities and states would have stay-at-home orders in place for so long.
Despite the bipartisan support, the Senate adjourned for a week-long recess Thursday without voting on extending the eight-week window. Meanwhile, some businesses that were among the first to get the money are entering their eighth week carrying loans and are unsure if they should risk spending the money without knowing if it will be forgiven later.
It's becoming clear that the loans won't be enough to save many small businesses as the pandemic continues for longer than most people, including the lawmakers who drew up the bill, expected.
More than 6% of small business owners surveyed by the Census Bureau said that they don't ever expect to return to normal operations and about 7% said they don't have enough cash on hand to last more than a week. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned this week that the central bank and Congress may have to do more to prevent some jobs from going away forever.
""If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there will be longer term damage to the economy,"" Powell said in an interview with CBS. 
""The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now,"" he added. 
Restaurant owners don't know if customers will return
Restaurants have been particularly hard hit. During the last week in March, the National Restaurant Association said 3% had already permanently closed. 
Cathy Rasco will reopen her shop, Arabica Coffee, in Portland, Maine, on June 1. But she's already decided that her second location, less than a mile away, is staying closed for good.
That location, near ferry and cruise ship terminals, was always slower in the winter. She couldn't imagine making it without a strong tourist season too. Rasco, who's been in business since 1995, moved everything out of what had been that larger of her two spaces, and is still looking for a home for her coffee roaster. 
She doesn't know if customers will come back once she reopens and is afraid to spend any of the loan money she received from the Paycheck Protection Program with so many unknowns and a lack of clarity around the rules. She plans to start by bringing back just a handful of the 26 staff she had when closures took effect. 
""I feel like I'm just gambling, and it's not the time to do that,"" Rasco said, noting that selling a low-price-point product like coffee means she needs hundreds of customers to be profitable. 
She's installing plexiglass along the bar to protect her workers and plans to allow customers in just one door and out another, encouraging one-way foot traffic. 
""I'm very aware this could be the end of Arabica, and if that's how it is, at least I know I'm giving it my best shot,"" she said. 
The loan program is a 'total failure'
Portland's LB Kitchen, named for its co-owners Lee Farrington and Bryna Gootkind, has been filling to-go orders for smoothies, salads, and sandwiches since late March. Gootkind says she doesn't know if they'll fully reopen until there's a vaccine.
On Wednesday, they announced that their second location would be closing permanently. ""LB West,"" as they called it, shared a space with a nonprofit organization and it seemed that it would be too hard to control people coming in-and-out while adhering to safety guidelines. 
They also received a loan from the Paycheck Protection Program, but at this point, don't intend on spending any of the money. 
Like many business owners, Gootkind said it didn't make any sense to bring all of her 24 workers back on payroll when her shop is still not fully open. Some workers find that, with a separate congressionally-approved $600-a-week boost to benefits, they're earning more on unemployment than they would by coming back to work -- especially if hours are reduced.
But that means LB Kitchen's loan might not be forgiven. So instead, they plan on giving it all back.
""Honestly, it's not even worth trying to figure out. It's like trying to crack a code,"" Gootkind said. ""I feel like it's a total failure."""

The shield, says RAS Completions, is designed to be installed between seats and doesn't involve taking the middle seat out of action.
The Personal Protection Window is currently seeking approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the company says it'll be ready for airline customers within the next couple weeks.
The shields are designed to protect passengers from the risk of droplet transmission and are made from transparent polycarbonate.
The idea, RAS Completions Business Development Manager Roger Patron tells CNN Travel, is to produce a ""single product that fits every type of commercial aircraft.""
It's mainly designed to aid economy seating, Patron says, as that's where passengers tend to be closest together, but it could also be used in different classes of cabin.
RAS Completions adds that the shields are non-obstructive, so wouldn't prevent emergency evacuation or seat recline.
""Simplicity is the best,"" says Patron. ""We tried to make them the simplest, effective way of keeping people safe.""
""Our product is very simple to make, it will be cheap, it will do the job -- it's not about the look, although we obviously understand that we want people to feel safe within the cabin.""
The cost aspect is crucial, says Patron, airlines have suffered financial losses in the wake of the pandemic, and will be keen to come up with solutions to getting passengers back in the sky that don't break the bank.
This hasn't stopped some aviation companies suggesting solutions that involve eradicating the middle seat -- including Interspace Lite, from transportation technology company Universal Movement, which envisages a temporarily-blocked-off middle seat and reimagines that seat as a divider.
Universal Movement has partnered with airplane seat manufacturer Safran and aims to bring Interspace to market by late summer.
Meanwhile, Italian company Aviointeriors has suggested a idea of a row of three economy seats with the middle seat facing the opposite way, while French engineer Florian Barjot's concept, PlanBay, also includes a removable piece of kit that could be placed on the middle seat.
The RAS Completions' Personal Protection Window doesn't really offer complete social distancing.
Patron says he's aware that getting travelers comfortable with flying again could be a challenge. 
""I think if you had the alternative which was nothing in between you and somebody you didn't know sitting a few inches away from you, I think I, for sure, would feel more secure if I had a little non-intrusive screen which gave me comfort that the airline first of all cared -- and also gave me the opportunity to distance myself from somebody in very close proximity,"" says Patron.
Because the shields are easy to install and uninstall, Patron says it's also a solution that's adaptable for an ever-changing situation. Ideally, it'll be used alongside face masks and hand sanitizer.
Patron says RAS Completions has been in contact with airlines and some are showing interest, others are remaining cautious and seeing how the market develops.
""We see this as a medium, not long term solution,"" he says.
""It has gone through some very rigorous testing, so if the airline needs it for six months or a year then it's built for that."""

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott warned that ""tougher actions"" may be imposed if the numbers there continue to spike, but he stressed that closing down the state again ""will always be the last option."" 
""Covid-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas, and it must be corralled,"" Abbott said Monday. Houstons Health Department said Harris County hospitals have a 177% increase in Covid-19 positive patients since May 31. 
The number of coronavirus cases in Florida reached a milestone on Monday, as the state reported 100,217 cases, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health. 
The Sunshine State has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,"" and risks being the ""worst it has ever been,"" according to projections from a model by scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
Arizona, where President Trump plans to travel today, continues to see its new case numbers climb. The state averaged about 2,412 new reported cases per day over the week ending June 21, up about 94% from the previous 7-day period, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.
Officials say the major thrust of new coronavirus cases in the US is in the South and West has also been attributed to more young people ignoring social distancing measures and testing positive.
Young people are more likely to have milder outcomes from coronavirus, but they can still infect others who are more at risk.
""With younger age of recent infections in at least some places such as Florida, expect a lower death rate in this wave ... until the 20-40 year olds who are infected today go on to infect others,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Twitter.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told Axios that the recent high number of cases in young people is ""not surprising."" Like Frieden, he warned of what's to come.
""They get infected first, then they come home, and then they infect the older people. The older people get the complications, and then they go to the hospitals,"" Fauci said. ""The death rate always lags several weeks behind the infection rate."""

At least 15 players have tested positive for Covid-19 so far, according to New Jersey State Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. 
""We have had several circumstances where indoor and outdoor gatherings in our state have led to community clusters of Covid-19. ... There's been an outbreak among Rutgers football players with 15 of them currently testing positive,"" she said during a news conference Wednesday, listing other outbreaks across the state.
A Rutgers Athletics spokesperson, however, could neither confirm to CNN that the cases were tied to a gathering nor provide further details. 
The Middlesex County Office of Health Services was not immediately available for comment. 
The Scarlet Knights have seen a growing number of positive cases after the team returned to campus June 15. Rutgers announced the quarantine and pause of in-person team activities last week after weekly tests brought the team total to 10 coronavirus cases. 
The program said in a statement Saturday it ""will work diligently with Rutgers medical experts, and state and local officials to determine next steps.""
It's unclear whether the gathering was tied to scheduled team activities. 
""I don't want to get out over my skis here but I believe that the incidents had nothing to do with athletic activity,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said during a news conference Monday.
Last week, Murphy issued an executive order that allowed outdoor sports activities to start up again in the state. 
The Rutgers outbreak should not affect that order, he said. 
Across the Big Ten Conference, Rutgers Football joins the Michigan State Spartans, which began a quarantine July 22 after one staff member tested positive for the virus. 
The Big Ten said earlier this month it intends to move to conference-only schedules, provided medical advice supports that decision. The NCAA, meanwhile, said it would continue its discussions into August on whether any of its 22 championships will proceed in late November.

The vaccine is expected to enter Phase 3 testing next week. This phase of the trial is expected to involve 30,000 volunteers and will test whether the vaccine protects people against the coronavirus.The vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), which are cells used to build proteins -- in this case, the proteins that are needed to build the coronavirus' spike protein, which the virus uses to attach itself to and infect human cells.

The US is seeing a resurgence of coronavirus infections after states began reopening their economies, with the number of cases now at more than 4.4 million and the death toll at 152,070, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation increased its forecast to 219,864 total deaths by November, in part because the nation continues to debate measures like wearing masks and social distancing.
""The thing we need to do is we need to pull out all the stops to get it down to baseline and to keep it there by doing the things that we've been talking about -- that I've been talking about -- consistently,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday during CNN's coronavirus town hall.
Regularly taking such precautions is especially important given that a backlog in getting test results is rendering some coronavirus testing practically useless.
""It shouldn't be acceptable"" that US testing is so backlogged, assistant Secretary for Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services Adm. Brett Giroir said Thursday.
While he said about 25% of tests give results in about 15 minutes, most take days. Giroir said his goal is for all tests to be ""sensitive and specific and back within 15 minutes.""
But, he said, ""you can't test your way out of this,"" and people should wear masks, avoid crowds and avoid being indoors with others.
Added Fauci: ""If we do that, then I think we will be well toward seeing this under control. If we don't, then we can't make a prediction about how long this will last.""
Uncertainty around rapidly developing vaccine
Meantime, the race is on for a vaccine to protect against coronavirus, and though some early data looks promising there are still questions around vaccines in development.
Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's multi-billion dollar Covid-19 vaccine program, has provided funding for two potential vaccines that have quickly made their way to advanced human trial phases.
The head of the operation, Moncef Slaoui, said Thursday he wouldn't be surprised if a vaccine turned out to be 90% effective against the virus, but Fauci said only time will tell.
""We will hope its going to be that way,"" Fauci said. ""As we've said all the time, you just never can tell. The proof of the pudding is to do the clinical trial and get the result and that's actually what we're doing.""
But people will need to get the vaccine in order for it to protect them, and even those who aren't deterred by existing conspiracy theories around vaccines could be scared off even by the project's name, Bill Gates said Thursday.
""We certainly need people to be rational about vaccines. They eradicated smallpox, they saved millions and millions of lives,"" he said. ""They are very complex to design, and that's why, you know, saying it's being done at Warp Speed is a little scary, because you really need to do the safety checks very, very carefully,"" said the founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Gates said the public should take comfort that the nonpolitical staff at the Food and Drug Administration are holding the line to ensure the rapidly developing drugs are effective and safe.
Plans put into action as first day of school nears
As the start of the school year grows closer, officials are tasked with balancing public concern over children's safety with the impact virtual learning could have on their education and welfare.
In New York City, students will return to school with safety protocols for cleaning, contact tracing and distancing, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday.
""We are doing everything in our power to keep kids healthy while ensuring they are getting the education they deserve. These rigorous test and trace protocols will keep our students and staff safe as we start off this new school year,"" de Blasio said.
Philadelphia originally was going to return to a school year that combined virtual and in-person learning, but after backlash the Board of Education voted to provide all remote learning until at least November, with Superintendent Dr. William Hite promising that the change will not remove the emphasis on student achievement.
Districts in Florida are still weighing their options, but Gov. Ron DeSantis is advocating for a model based on parents' choice.
""I believe that there should be a choice for parents throughout Florida,"" DeSantis said.""Parents who prefer distance learning should be able to opt for it, and parents who desire in person instruction should have access to it.""
States try to turn trends downward
As parents and school districts weigh their choices, state officials are strategizing how to reverse climbing infection numbers.
Texas researchers estimated Thursday that just two weeks of social distancing policies cut the spread of coronavirus by 65%, while states that have resisted those policies saw almost no reduction.
Illinois could be reversing its reopening plan and heading back toward social distancing polices (Can we be more specific here?) if the number of positive cases continue to climb, said Governor J.B. Pritzker during a news conference on Thursday.
Arizona is a state ""headed in the right direction"" with a downward trend since early July, Gov. Doug Ducey said Thursday.
""This is not a victory lap. This is not a celebration. If anything, it's evidence that the decisions, and the sacrifice that Arizonans are making are working,"" Ducey said.

""At this time, we know there were six students and three staff members who were in school for at least some time last week who have since reported to us that they have tested positive,"" North Paulding High School Principal Gabe Carmona said Saturday in a letter to parents obtained by the AJC.
Carmona said the school custodial staff is cleaning and disinfecting the building every day. 
""It is my intention to regularly notify the NPHS community of these cases in the interest of transparency and so that we, as a community, can be aware of any trends that arise and respond accordingly,"" the principal wrote.
CNN is trying to obtain a copy of the principal's letter.
News of the cases comes just days after the high school in Dallas, Georgia -- about 40 miles from Atlanta -- attracted nationwide attention thanks to a photo posted on Twitter by sophomore Hannah Watters. The viral image showed Hannah's classmates in a crowded school hallway with few visible masks. The school and its district, the Paulding County School District, resumed classes August 3.
""I was concerned for the safety of everyone in that building and everyone in the county because precautions that the CDC and guidelines that the CDC has been telling us for months now, weren't being followed,"" Hannah told CNN Thursday. 
It's just the latest instance of students and teachers testing positive for Covid-19 after returning to school, highlighting the risks of resuming in-person classes amid the coronavirus pandemic.
'Good and necessary trouble,' student says
Paulding County Schools Superintendent Brian Otott said in a letter to the community this week that the viral photo was taken out of context and that class changes in high school were a challenge. 
""It is an area we are continuing to work on in this new environment to find practicable ways to further limit students from congregating. Students are in this hallway environment for just a brief period as they move to their next class,"" Otott said. 
He added: ""There is no question that the photo does not look good ... Wearing a mask is a personal choice, and there is no practical way to enforce a mandate to wear them.""'
Otott's letter also said the district anticipated needing to make ""adjustments."" The district previously decided to make Thursday and Friday virtual learning days for students receiving in-person instruction ""so that all of our schools can step back and assess how things are going so far,"" Otott said.
Hannah said she was initially suspended for posting the photo. But on Friday, her mother told CNN the suspension had been reversed. Lynne Watters spoke with the school's principal Friday morning, she said, and was told her daughter would not be suspended and a suspension would not appear on her record.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)After 50,000 Covid-19 deaths, enormous job losses and and more than a month under lockdown, stunned Americans are looking for signs of hope. And President Donald Trump has been trying to provide them. 
But Trump's evening briefings at the White House have instead produced a string of uncomfortable collisions between politics and science -- not least his suggestion Thursday that injecting disinfectant into the body could potentially kill the virus.
In another of his remarkable comments, the President had earlier touted the benefits of an unproven drug in fighting Covid-19, a fact he downplays now that research has suggested it may not work. The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, had urged caution on the drug, hydroxychloroquine, and another prominent government scientist alleged this week that he was reassigned after refusing to join in promoting its use. 
In New York magazine, Jonathan Chaitwarned that when politics steers science, you can wind up with the grotesque example of the Soviet Union's Trofim Lysenko under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. Real scientists were silenced as the regime empowered Lysenko to dispute the proven laws of genetics, Chait wrote earlier this month. Lysenko even claimed, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, ""that wheat plants raised in the appropriate environment produce seeds of rye, which is equivalent to saying that dogs living in the wild give birth to foxes."" 
""Lysenko genetics"" has long been a laughingstock. Science proceeds on its own terms and timetable; it can't be counted on to provide the solutions public officials desperately want, when they want them.
""For weeks, Trump and Fox News hosts and guests incessantly repeated unproven claims about hydroxychloroquine,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""Trump and everyone else who magnifies the President's most irresponsible exhortations bears guilt in this disaster."" 
At Thursday's briefing, Trump invited a government official to talk about research indicating the virus could be killed by sunlight and humidity, in an apparent effort to vindicate the President's controversial early prediction that the virus might disappear during the summer, which the National Academy of Sciences has questioned. And Trump suggested patients could be treated by the internal use of UV light and disinfectants, an idea that doctors immediately dismissed as ridiculous and dangerous. (On Friday he said his suggestion had been a ""sarcastic question."")
Challenged by reporters, Trump replied, ""I'm just here to present talent. I'm here to present ideas ... If heat is good, if light is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned."" His remarks reinforced Michael D'Antonio's view that ""in this time of pandemic, when unimaginable suffering has befallen our nation, he is essentially channeling not Abraham Lincoln, or Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the long-dead Johnny Carson ... Trump appears to be relying on his showman's instinct and on what he remembers of the TV star who was once his idol,"" he wrote. 
""Trump didn't invent any of this,""Jill Filipovic observed. ""A Republican Party that sowed distrust in science because the reality of climate change was financially inconvenient for fossil fuel companies, and determined that conservative, patriarchal Christian morality should take precedence over public health in how we teach our kids about sex and the human body, is exactly what brought us Trump in the first place,"" Filipovic wrote. 
""More than three years into his presidency,"" argued Garry Kasparov, ""Trump -- facing an unprecedented crisis in the form of a deadly pandemic -- has shown himself to be a dangerous pathogen. Trump has spent his time in office weakening the nation's systemic immune system -- or institutions that hold him in check -- and setting the US up for a disaster when those institutions are needed more than ever."" 
Faulting Trump for the pandemic's deadly sweep across the US is wrong, wrote Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post. ""Trump heeded the advice of our public health experts every step of the way. When Fauci and Deborah Birx recommended that he implement population mitigation measures, he did so -- shutting down a booming US economy to protect public health."" Thiessen asked, ""Why was everyone so slow to see the coming danger? Because at a time when China's government should have been alerting us to prepare for an unprecedented contagion, Chinese officials were spreading disinformation that kept the United States and the world in the dark.""
For Project Syndicate, the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten wrote that despite their failures, Trump's bashing of China and the World Health Organization is unproductive right now. ""To recover from these horrors and their aftermath, we must try to persuade China to work with us, and we must strengthen the institutions that are essential for effective international cooperation.""
Trump's Thursday briefing also featured an appearance by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield attempting a walk-back of his comments in the Washington Post that a fall wave of the disease could be even more difficult because it would coincide with a seasonal flu outbreak. The move backfired, since Redfield acknowledged he was quoted accurately. 
The CDC director is not the only one who fears the future spread of Covid-19 will be even worse. In a sobering interview with Peter Bergen, infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm said the ultimate death toll in the US could be in the range of 800,000, 16 times what it was as of Friday. 
""This first wave of illness is, in fact, just the beginning of what could very easily be 16 to 18 months of substantial activity of this virus around the world, coming and going, wave after wave,"" Osterholm said. The US desperately needs a long-term strategy to fight the virus, a middle way where ""we open our economy and everyday life in a way that is capable of rapidly detecting the emergence of new waves of infection. Then we do whatever we can again with physical distancing to limit the new infection's spread."" 
Trump has encouraged governors and protesters to push for the rapid reopening of America even when such moves violate the guidelines laid down by his own scientific advisers. And Georgia's Gov. Brian Kemp proved eager to respond, ordering that many businesses could reopen Friday. Trump at first welcomed the move, but as criticism grew, he said he was ""not happy with Brian Kemp,"" particularly for allowing spas, nail salons and tattoo parlors to be among those reopening. 
In 1918, a premature reopening by the city of Denver produced a severe outbreak of the deadly influenza, John Avlon pointed out. ""Kemp seems more intent on playing to the base than listening to scientists,"" he wrote. ""He was late to the lockdown and now wants to open up early. But then again, he's the same governor -- of the CDC's home state -- who said it was news to him that asymptomatic people could spread the disease, two months after it was common knowledge."" 
Reopening requires a careful look at the underlying health conditions that make people particularly vulnerable to the disease, wrote Dr. Eric Schulze and Madhu Vijayan. ""Rather than continuing to use a sledgehammer plan to defeat this virus, there may be wisdom in using a scalpel: a targeted approach that shelters the vulnerable and clearly delineates who is not at risk. This could create a path for reentry into normal life in a carefully structured manner."" 
""I am someone whom Covid-19 could easily kill,"" wrote Van Jones, noting that for decades he used ""social justice activism as an excuse to neglect my health ... I ate crappy food, rarely exercised, guzzled diet soda and rarely slept."" Now he struggles with high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and hypertension. 
""This virus is wiping out black people like me in hugely disproportionate numbers.
""If the African American community is going to beat this virus -- and create a pandemic-resistant black community -- we are going to have to make big changes in both our public systems and our personal lives ... Ensuring the health of African Americans means addressing the lack of access (food deserts), racial discrimination in health care and the epidemic of over-incarceration,"" along with lifestyle changes, Jones wrote. 
One of the most promising treatments for Covid-19 appears to be the use of blood plasma from recovered patients, wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. ""Strangest and most miraculous of all, convalescent plasma treatment is cheap -- no drug company, villainous hedge-fund mover and shaker or insurance company is getting a cut. Rather, plasma uses altruistic donors, an existing network of blood banks and routine hospital processes for collection and delivery."" (For a look at its use in one case, read Thomas Lake's column, ""The Distance."")
For more on Covid-19 and its impact: 
A presidential campaign like none other in US history continued to play out, with Trump using the White House briefings to sound his campaign themes and Joe Biden trying to get his message out while raising campaign funds. 
""With less than 200 days until Election Day,"" wrote Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan, ""the Trump campaign has nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on hand to spend raining down negative Biden television and digital ads on key swing states."" 
Ads from Trump and his supporters ""may not only take the lies and misinformation to a new level; they could use the latest in artificial intelligence to manipulate voice and video to make their points."" 
The other big question for Democrats is who Biden will pick as his running mate. He's promised that he will choose a woman to run for vice president. There's one outstanding choice, according to Julian Zelizer: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""She would instantly energize Biden's campaign and expand its capacity to reach a broad electoral base,"" Zelizer wrote. 
David Andelman argued for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: ""Whitmer brings her skills as a governor and public official who has unfailingly seen from the get-go what her state needs in this, its most critical hour, and with laser-like precision has gone after it. With her leadership skills, she has also shown herself prepared to do so for the nation as well."" 
Former NAACP president Ben Jealous has known Stacey Abrams for nearly 30 years and is convinced she's right for the veep role. She ""brings something to politics that is often lacking -- creative approaches to complex challenges, and given the current pandemic crisis we are facing, we need her creative thinking, now more than ever."" 
The nearest grocery store is two hours away. Wildlife photographer Kim Wolhuter and his wife and daughter know about isolation. They live with little outside human interaction on a huge wildlife reserve in Zimbabwe. 
""What we lack in material belongings, bank balances, convenience and community,"" he said in an interview with CNN's Inside Africa, ""we make up for with a deep and real connection to nature, a focus on family time (a lot of it) and a sense of peace that I think the world is missing. We live simply but fully.""
Part of that lifestyle is a closeness to nature and the local population of wild hyenas. Wolhuter said he has a problem with the way ""The Lion King ... totally vilifies hyenas."" He's working on a project ""to change the way we see hyenas so we can protect these incredible creatures and their habitat.""
The family shares some rituals ""that make the experience of isolation particularly enjoyable. One of them is sleeping out under the night sky as much as possible -- but especially when the moon is full. We wake up full of dew, to see the setting of the moon and rising of the sun.""
Asked for advice to the rest of us living in isolation, Wolhuter said: ""In this time of crisis, I ask that you give up technology for that briefest of moments and connect with nature in whatever way you can, even just peering out the window."""

Texas, Virginia and Vermont each said they recognized the data issue and moved to fix it in the past few days. 
Diagnostic PCR tests, which use saliva or sputum, check for current infection, while antibody tests, which rely on blood, check for past infection. Combining the two into one result could provide an inaccurate picture of where and when the virus spread and mislead policy-makers and the public.
""Public health officials need to know how many people in my state or my community currently have Covid-19. They also need to learn how many people had it in the past and potentially are immune to it,"" said CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""Those are two completely different things.""
Combining the two types of tests could also overstate a state's ability to test and track active infections.
""You only know how many cases you have if you do a lot of testing,"" Cohen said. ""If you put the two tests together, you fool yourself into thinking you've done more testing than you have.""
Virginia and Vermont health officials said they fixed the data issue in the past week. Chris Van Duysen, spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email Monday that the state ""will be separating the numbers out this week"" and is ""working to integrate that into our online reporting.""
The issue is just one of the ways that coronavirus testing data can mislead or obscure when not used consistently and appropriately. 
For example, some countries and research institutions, including Johns Hopkins University and its widely cited coronavirus dashboard, have relied on data from a mysterious data aggregation site called Worldometer. And in the US in recent days, Georgia and Florida have faced questions about the transparency of their coronavirus data reporting.
Issues in Texas, Virginia and Vermont
The issue in Texas came after the Texas Observer reported the two testing results were being combined. Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday the state is not presently combining the numbers but did not acknowledge that it had been in the past.
""The answer is no. They are not comingling those numbers,"" Abbott said. ""Those numbers will be provided separately.""
Texas State Rep. Chris Turner, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, found Abbott's statement puzzling and reached out to the health department after Monday's press conference.
""They confirmed to my staff that in fact the testing total does include the antibody test. They said they would be breaking those out later in the week,"" Turner said. ""But for now the total number of tests reported includes both types of test.""
Turner argued that combining the numbers ""really muddies the data"" and ""indicates that our testing total is inflated.""
The Department of State Health Services did not provide CNN more specifics Tuesday on what percentage of the total tests being reported are antibody tests.
As of Wednesday morning, the department's website said the state had a total of 744,937 tests, 23,601 of those are from public labs, while 721,336 are from private labs. The state is reporting a total of 49,912 positive cases. The state's coronavirus dashboard did not yet reflect a distinction in antibody tests versus active virus tests. 
Abbott has been touting the low positivity rate in the state. It's unclear how many of those positive cases are from antibody tests or active infection tests.
Virginia similarly had been combining its antibody and diagnostic tests in its reported testing data, the Virginia Department of Health said last week. The department said separating out the results made ""minimal change in the percent positive of tests and no difference in overall trends.""
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, said he directed the Department of Health to separate out the testing results last week.
""I am a doctor, and I have said all along that I will act based on science and dataand the data must be reliable and up-to-date, so we can make informed decisions based on the facts,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Going forward, the (Virginia Department of Health) website will break out the number of diagnostic tests.""
Vermont, too, began separating its antibody test results from its diagnostic test results on May 16, according to the Department of Health.
""As we began seeing an increase in serology tests, we realized this is impacting the number and needed to correct it,"" said Ben Truman, spokesman for Vermont's Department of Health.

The decision to restart the CDC briefings comes as the death toll has reached a grim milestone of more than 103,000 and the White House has been under fire as of late for sidelining the Trump administration's health experts on its own coronavirus task force.
The CDC held a briefing Friday in which director Robert Redfield defended the agency's surveillance for the coronavirus and denied that it missed the spread of the virus across the country.
That session was the first of the resumption of the CDC's regular press briefings, a senior Health and Human Services official told CNN. 
The last of the regular briefings was March 9, shortly after a top CDC official warned that coronavirus would rapidly spread in the US, while the White House was downplaying the seriousness of it.
When the CDC conducted its regular briefings -- at times daily and then several times a week -- it included extensive question-and-answer sessions between reporters and the agency's medical experts.
The comments from Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, sent the stock market tumbling and in turn angered President Donald Trump.
Sources had told CNN that the trust issues between the CDC and White House trace back to the CDC's botched effort to distribute testing in early February, when contamination in the lab led to long delays. The relationship further soured after Messonnier's comments at the March 9 CDC briefing.
Significant tension between the White House and CDC has increasingly built over guidelines on how to reopen the country and how the government tracks data on the virus.
In interviews with CNN, CDC officials said they've been ""muzzled"" and that their agency's efforts to mount a coordinated response to the Covid-19 pandemic were hamstrung by a White House whose decisions are driven by politics rather than science.
Earlier this month, CNN reported the Trump administration shelved CDC-drafted guidelines to reopen the US, which were strict and more detailed than the White House's own road map toward a return to normal.
Trump has aggressively pushed for states to reopen even when they don't necessarily meet the parameters set out by his task force, whose meetings have been sharply curtailed.
The doctors on the task force, including Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, have appeared in public less and less as the country begins to reopen, despite fears of a potential resurgence.
During an interview with STAT in April, when it was pointed out that the CDC hadn't held a briefing in a month, Redfield was asked if he feared the CDC was being sidelined at a crucial moment.
""No, I wouldn't say that at all. I think we're fully engaged in all of the decisions,"" he told the health news site, adding, ""We're at the task force meeting every single day. We're giving our public health guidance and our recommendations.""

The states are among 18 across the nation seeing increasing trends in new cases from one week to the next. More than 2 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus and 116,962 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Health experts are warning that more infections and deaths are in store as states continue their reopening plans. 
Florida recorded almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases on Monday -- the highest number of new and confirmed cases in a single day the state has seen, according to the Florida Department of Health. Despite the increase, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Tuesday that the state will not shut down. 
""We're going to go forward. We're going to continue to protect the most vulnerable,"" DeSantis said. ""We're going to urge, continue to advise, particularly our elderly population to maintain social distancing, avoid crowds.""
Arizona reached a record-high daily number of cases on Tuesday, as did Texas.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott attributed the increase to an outbreak at an assisted living facility and delayed reporting.
But the state's hospitalization rate, a number officials monitor to ensure the healthcare system isn't overwhelmed, has been increasing as well.
Nationwide reopenings coupled with the flouting of personal safety measures has led researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington to increase their projections of Covid-19 deaths this summer.
""Unless we are effective at other things like wearing a mask, avoiding contact, it's going to pretty inexorably lead to the second wave,"" IHME Dr. Chris Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper. 
 18 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: West Virginia, California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Hawaii.
 10 states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Washington, Utah, South Dakota, Mississippi, Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Alaska, Maine and Delaware.
 22 states are seeing a downward trend: Iowa, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
 One state, Michigan, has seen a decrease of at least 50%.
The second wave may be coming, but we aren't out of the first yet
Early on, it looked as though the finish line for the pandemic was the end of summer. And even though experts no longer see that as the case, many Americans are eager to return to a sense of normalcy.
""We may be done with the pandemic, but the pandemic is not done with us,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said Tuesday. 
Murray expects a ""second wave"" to be begin late August, with the US reaching more than 201,000 coronavirus deaths by October 1. 
But rates of coronavirus cases in the US haven't yet dropped to a level low enough to call the first wave over.
As the virus spreads, it appears to be following highways, researchers from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania said Tuesday.
People are leaving their homes now that more places are opening. As more people interact with others, the disease spreads, the researchers found.
Texas mayors want mandatory masks to mitigate the spread
Nine Texas mayors, including the top officials in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have urged the state's governor to require face masks to stop the virus from spreading in their cities.
""If mayors are given the opportunity to require face coverings, we believe our cities will be ready to help reduce the spread of this disease,"" the mayors said in a letter to Abbott. 
New research supports the case for wearing masks to reduce spread.
In a study reported Tuesday, researchers estimated between 230,000 and 450,000 cases of the virus were prevented in the states that enacted requirements for mask use between April 8 and May 15.
""The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public might help in mitigating COVID-19 spread,"" wrote Wei Lyu and George Wehby, with the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa's College of Public Health.
Also in hopes of mitigating spread, the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives headed by former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden released a new contact tracing playbook Tuesday.
The guide will supplement CDC efforts to give local public health departments detailed guidance on how they can keep the virus from spreading further.

Cohen told ""The View"" on Tuesday that the roadblock is what he calls ""antiquated and discriminatory guidelines by the FDA to prevent HIV.""
The FDA's updated rules bar any man who has had sex with another man in the past three months from donating blood or plasma.
If there are enough antibodies in donated plasma, some doctors say, it can potentially kill Covid-19 in patients who have the disease. In April, the FDA said they are limiting the plasma treatments to those who are most seriously ill.
Cohen announced his positive Covid-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March, ""after a few days of self-quarantine, and not feeling great."" About 11 days later, the Bravo executive returned to work on his radio show and shared his experience recovering from the virus at home.
He told Anderson Cooper in April that after recovering, he signed up for a program at Mount Sinai in New York because the hospital system put out notice of an urgent need for plasma from people who had overcome coronavirus. 
""They said, 'You can't do it,'"" Cohen told ""The View."" ""I was hurt. I just thought well this is crazy, technology has come so far."" 
""They're worried about HIV in blood,"" he said. ""But I'm HIV negative. And you can find that out, and then you can test my blood a couple of times before putting it into a system.""
The ""Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"" host said he's been speaking out for months to urge the FDA to reexamine the outdated rules.
 ""What a loss,"" Cohen said on ""The View."" ""Here I have these robust antibodies, and I can't share my plasma and possibly help anybody. Extreme disappointment."""

But as Hollywood seeks to adopt new health and safety protocols, production is going to take more time -- and money.
That was the main takeaway from a Hollywood Radio and Television Society panel Wednesday night, discussing the logistics of production during a pandemic. Participants estimated testing and other precautions are adding roughly 10% to production costs, and cited the need for ""Covid-related contingencies"" being incorporated into series budgets, said Erika Munro Kennerly, senior vice president and associate general counsel of Endeavor Content.
""Production is coming back. It's just going to take a little bit longer and cost a little bit more,"" said Scott Hervey, an entertainment attorney with Weintraub Tobin.
Notably, of the four content producers who participated in the conversation, three said that someone on a program had come back with a positive test, although luckily, none had been exposed to enough fellow cast or crew to require a complete shutdown.
At this point, the logistics favor so-called reality shows -- which can ""get up and running a lot faster,"" Kennerly said -- but even those are being slowed down by the need to test and quarantine before shooting can begin.
CBS' ""Big Brother"" returned on Aug. 5, and the network announced that the dating show ""Love Island"" will begin its second season later this month, now shot in notably landlocked Las Vegas. ABC's ""The Bachelorette"" is also resuming production, Variety reported.
""What you're asking those people to do is take a lot more time out of their regular life,"" ABC senior vice president of alternative series, specials and latenight programming Robert Mills said in reference to ""The Bachelorette,"" and the need to test and quarantine prior to filming.
While the panelists said most people are happy to be working after in some instances being idled for months, there is considerable anxiety associated with the process.
Producers have also become more adept at working remotely and finding novel solutions. The panelists generally agreed that being adaptable would be necessary, citing expectations that production restrictions associated with coronavirus will continue to be an issue at least through the rest of the year.
Because there are greater challenges to producing scripted shows, increased production of unscripted programming will likely help fill the void in the near term. There will also be more acquisitions of existing series and virtual production, with ABC having announced that the Emmy Awards won't be in person next month, after the BET Awards and Daytime Emmys went that route.
""These are definitely times when you can innovate and actually be pretty creative,"" ABC's Mills said."

""The most important thing I could convey today that is even though the numbers of Covid-19 have improved, it has not left Jefferson County, it has not left Orange County, it has not left the state of Texas,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said.
Texas has been at the center of the resurgence of coronavirus cases along with California and Florida, which are both reporting thousands of new daily cases. Though Texas officials initially came under scrutiny for downplaying the severity of the virus' spread and acting slowly to pull back plans for reopening, Abbott said during a news conference Tuesday that the state is ramping up distribution of personal protective equipment and encouragingTexans to wear masks and socially distance. 
""The bottom line is Texans realized how dangerous Covid-19 can be,"" Abbott said.
Infection and hospitalization metrics are improving in the state, but are ""still too high,"" he said. To get businesses up and running, Texans need to lower and maintain the positivity rate below 10% and stick to safety precautions. 
Beaumont Mayor Becky Ames said in the news conference with Abbott that the spike in July followed people letting their guards down as the state reopened. And rising positivity rates now could be the result of the same thing, Abbott said.
""There's a reason why this is happening, I believe, and that is some people feel if they're just with family members -- even if it's 50 family members -- they can let their guard down,"" Abbott said. ""And that turns out not to be the case.""
The next reopening in the state will be for the new school year; and though local leaders will decide how and when to go back, officials have been working to provide schools with the personal protective equipment and sanitizer they need to stay safe, he said.
Positive tests amid starts to a new school year
School buildings have been reopening across the country, even as new coronavirus cases among students and staff have been reported in places where in-person learning has resumed.
In Ohio, more than a third of Ohio students, totaling about 590,000 children, will return to full-time in-person learning, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday.
But among the 101 largest school districts in the country, 63 will start the new academic year remotely over virus concerns.
Public schools in Elizabeth, New Jersey, had to scrap plans to return to classrooms and switch to virtual learning after more than 400 teachers notified the district that they could not return to campus due to ""special considering for health-related risks."" 
Students have not yet returned to school in the Broken Arrow Public School District in Oklahoma, but 33 district employees tested positive last week, Superintendent Janet Vinson said Monday, according to Tulsa World.
Meanwhile, North Paulding High School in Georgia will announce plans to reopen Wednesday after reporting several virus cases and receiving criticism over a viral photo that showed students -- few wearing masks -- walking in a packed school hallway. 
Rely on science -- not politics, Fauci says
Although practices like wearing face coverings have been politicized, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he has learned that in order to be a good public health leader in a crisis, you have to divorce yourself from politics, rely on science and be as transparent as possible.
""Completely divorce yourself from the kind of political undertones that sometimes go into an important outbreak like this,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as he was honored with a 2020 Citizen Leadership Award Tuesday night by the Aspen Institute."" ""You've got to stay away from that, lead by example, be perfectly honest and don't be afraid to say you don't know something when you don't know it. I find that to be a very good formula when you're dealing in a crisis.""
Even with the polarization, every state in the US passed at least one physical distancing measure in March to slow the spread, researchers from Harvard University and University College London said. Those measures worked, a new study found.
Physical distancing resulted in the reduction of more than 600,000 cases within just three weeks, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS. Had there not been preventative interventions, the models suggest up to 80% of Americans would have been infected with Covid-19.
""In short, these measures work, and policy makers should use them as an arrow in their quivers to get on top of local epidemics where they are not responding to containment measures,"" said the study's co-author Dr. Mark J. Siedner in a news release
Rushing, but not racing, toward a vaccine
A vaccine against the virus is anxiously anticipated, but health experts said that the US will not rush its development -- even as Russia announces its own.
""We will require any vaccine in the United States be safe and effective and meet the FDA is gold standard,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a news conference from Taipei, Taiwan, adding that ""this is not a race to be first."" 
Russia claims to have approved a ""world first"" coronavirus vaccine, but is only in the first step of clinical trials, Azar said. And data from those trials have not been made public.
Fauci has serious doubts that Russia's approved vaccine is safe and effective, he told Deborah Roberts of ABC News.
""We have half a dozen or more vaccines,"" Fauci said. ""So if we wanted to take the chance of hurting a lot of people or giving them something that doesn't work, we could start doing this, you know, next week if we wanted to. But that's not the way it works.""
If the US eventually approves a vaccine from Moderna Inc., the company will manufacture and deliver 100 million doses after striking a $1.525 billion deal with the Trump administration, according to a news release from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Moderna is one of several companies manufacturing the vaccine ""at risk,"" as the industry calls it, meaning the company is currently making the vaccine before it is approved. Clinical trials are currently underway to test whether it's safe and effective.

 (CNN)The public health threat of the Covid-19 pandemic has made the American public acutely aware of the impactful work done by researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health.
Federally funded researchers from coast to coast and beyond are working feverishly to understand SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. These scientists are racing to understand its makeup, its mechanism of entry into the human body, its characteristics outside the body and what existing therapies may help patients while a vaccine is being developed.
Why, then, did the NIH last week, as first reported by Politico, terminate a grant that supports leading research into how coronaviruses can be transferred from their natural host of bats to humans? 
The answer, it seems to me, is because Pete Daszak, the scientist who leads EcoHealth Alliance, the nonprofit biomedical research organization sponsoring the project, has collaborated with Shi Zhengli, a Chinese virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. 
In confirming to CNN that the grant funding was terminated the NIH said it ""does not discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards,"" but made a point to list sub-awardees, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This leaves room for speculation, as the Politico piece suggests, that it may have been at the behest of -- or at least with a strong implied nudge -- from the Trump administration. 
The agency's budget is established by Congress and the institutes make their own funding decisions, as they are best positioned to understand costs and needs of the projects. But the decision to yank Daszak's funding follows a growing effort by some to place blame on China for this pandemic.
And earlier this month, President Donald Trump said that there may be funding cuts in the research after a reporter suggested that grant money had been given to the Wuhan lab. (According to Politico, Daszak has maintained that ""no fund from [the grant] have been sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor has any contract been signed."") 
Now that the President has seemingly made good on that promise, many scientists are deeply concerned. Meanwhile, NIH-funded researchers have been working hard to investigate the virus killing more Americans than the Vietnam War. 
Zhengli and Daszak, who I know of by reputation due to their impressive work, are virus hunters -- skilled experts seeking out coronaviruses and other diseases that could be transferable from bat populations to humans, the same disease vector scientists believe to be the genesis of the current outbreak. 
Combined, the researchers have collected thousands of samples and identified hundreds of new coronaviruses with the goal of preventing future pandemics. 
Daszak's credentials are impressive. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and in the past has advised the director of medical preparedness policy on the White House national security team.
His first five-year NIH grant on this topic began in 2014, after the usual competitive research funding process scientists across the country must navigate. Preliminary data are collected, hypotheses are generated, and proposals are written to share the research goals, methods, anticipated results.
These grants are then reviewed not by government bureaucrats but by fellow scientists, and often competitors, who are selected to serve on grant review panels because they are experts in the field. These review panelists understand the science in question and can evaluate the scientific merit behind the proposal. 
So rigorous is the process that last fiscal year, according to the NIH, more than 67,000 grant applications were received and only 22% were approved for funding. In FY2014, when Daszak was first funded, the success rate was only 20%. In 2019, Daszak submitted a proposal to extend his grant another five years, and the panelists found the research so promising that the NIH funded the grant to 2024. 
Included among the 20 scientific papers published from Daszak's initial grant is the discovery of how SARS coronaviruses enter cells -- a critical piece of information necessary for those working to develop Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines.
According to Politico, in a letter to EcoHealth Alliance officials last Friday, Michael Lauer, the NIH deputy director for extramural research, stated that Daszak's research does not ""align with the program goals and agency priorities."" There has been no reported explanation from the NIH as to why the research no longer aligns with NIH priorities.
More than a million Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, and over 61,000 have died.
Yet, regardless of whether the Trump administration is responsible for the funding cuts, the President has expressed views that a well-respected scientist and expert on coronavirus research is no longer worthy of investment. How can that be possible?
It seems that Trump's desire to keep the spotlight on China's role in the pandemic has overridden scientific independence. And this mentality seems to be spreading. Last weekend, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas suggested Chinese students should come to America to study Shakespeare but not science, arguing that they ""go back to China... and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people.""
Has this growing jingoism influenced the decision to revoke Daszak's research grant? 
Politicizing peer-reviewed science is a dangerous threat to the independent American scientific enterprise and is the first step on a deeply concerning slippery slope.
If Daszak's research can be stopped by funding cuts at the whim of the President, what other research grants in the future will be pulled because of the left or right leanings of any future president? What damage would such a decision have on the world-leading productivity and reputation of the National Institutes of Health? 
Science must remain independent and nonpoliticized if it is to be trusted and productive during this pandemic crisis and beyond."

Most schools in the United States are closed for the rest of the academic year and plans for the fall are in flux, with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention making recommendations that include reduced hours, social distancing and extended dismissals.
In other countries, some schools are reopening classrooms. Here is how some of those schools look, which could provide clues for how we think our children will, one day, resume their education.
In South Korea, students won't all return at once. Third-year high school students will start back next week so they can make career and college decisions, Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said.
Middle schools, elementary schools and kindergartens will be open by June 1, Yoo said.
Most of Vietnam's 22 million students returned to class Monday, after a monthslong closure, according to state media Vietnam News Agency (VNA). 
But online and televised classes will continue with new schedules and reduced in-person teaching, the report said.
In Austria, students will split into two cohorts to attend school every other day to allow for distancing, Education Minister Heinz Fassmann said, according to reports.
Israel is beginning a phased return over the next few weeks and setting a maximum limit of 17 students in each classroom.
The Ministry of Education told CNN that attendance was about 60% in the schools that did open earlier this week, possibly a sign that parents were nervous about sending their children back. 
Denmark, which was one of the first nations in Europe to close shops, restaurants and schools, has welcomed children back to class.
Desks are placed so students sit at least 2 meters or 6 feet apart.
Schools in Denmark are also having children eat lunch in their classrooms to avoid students gathering in larger groups. 
In Australia, the government has asked older or more vulnerable members of the school community to work from home if possible.
Germany is requiring social distancing for students in and out of classrooms, with some schools taping distance and direction markers on floors to keep people safely apart.
An elementary school in Hangzhou, China, helped children to keep their distance by making hats for them to wear in the classroom, the People's Daily reported.
Wherever children and teachers have been welcomed back to school, masks seem to be a near constant.

Los Angeles County reported 1,491 new coronavirus cases on Monday, bringing the total to 13,816, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.
At Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, most of the people coming to the emergency room are experiencing respiratory issues.
""What we are seeing is a lot more sicker people now coming in that qualify for an inpatient stay,"" said Dr. Paryus Patel, chief medical officer of Centinela Hospital Medical Center. ""So typically, we used to see on a non-Covid day about 150, 180 patients a day. We are seeing about 90 to 100 (patients) -- averaging out. Most of them come in for an acute medical need which will require hospitalization.""
Patel is also seeing signs that people are loosening their own social distancing measures despite mandates from Garcetti and California Gov. Gavin Newsom for residents to shelter at home.
""After Easter, we got hit hard and that was because families were visiting each other,"" Patel said of Centinela Hospital where he estimates 40% to 45% of patients are Covid-19 infected. ""So they are visiting more patients and families, which they shouldn't be doing and that's why we're going to start seeing more and more.""
He warned that Los Angeles County has not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.
""We still have two to three more weeks to curtail this disease and probably plateau or flatten it out,"" Patel said. The doctor warned that if people don't continue social distancing, California's system of hospitals could be overwhelmed with patients.
Meanwhile at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the hospital has seen its patient volume drop significantly and is now at half capacity. It's Covid-19 patient volume has been stable for two weeks with about 120 to 130 patients fighting the disease. But even with the coronavirus patients, Cedars-Sinai's emergency room is seeing about half the volumes that it normally would.
""Right now, we're taking care of about 400 or so non-Covid patients,"" said Dr. Jeff Smith, chief operating officer of Cedars-Sinai Hospital. ""We're still caring for three- to four-times as many non-Covid patients as we are Covid patients but we still have a lot of capacity because patients have chosen to avoid the hospital.""
Both Centinela Hospital and Cedars-Sinai have separate areas of their facilities dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients and both hospitals want people to seek out medical attention before their health deteriorates.
""It really just comes back to if you have an urgent or an emergent need, we can care for you safely at the hospital,"" said Smith, of Cedars-Sinai. ""And you should come."""

(CNN) Although most governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel, a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.
Earlier this month, the European Union unveiled an action plan to reopen its internal borders in time for summer, while countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed ""travel bubbles,"" lifting restrictions for each other's citizens.
A number of Caribbean islands are preparing to open their doors to foreign visitors in June, while destinations such as Mexico and Thailand are planning to open up again region by region in the coming weeks.
If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now. 
Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.
According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.
The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26.
Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room ""quarantine hotel"" will be available to patients' family and ""close contacts.""
""The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,"" states the letter.
The news came shortly after Cyprus Transport Minister Yiannis Karousos announced hotels in the country will reopen on June 1, while international air travel will restart on June 9.
Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter.
Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first.
From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic. 
However, the list is to be expanded to include further countries in the coming months.
Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip.
The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart.
Bali has also been successful in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with less than 350 confirmed cases and, at the time of writing, a total of four deaths. 
The Indonesian island now hopes to welcome tourists back by October, provided its infection rates stay low.
Bali's economy is hugely dependent on tourism and visitor numbers have been rising in recent years, with around 6.3 million people visiting in 2019.
""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy ... it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mangku Nyoman Kandia, a Bali tour guide, told ABC News in April. ""No tourist, no money.""
All foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, are currently banned from Indonesia, and anyone entering the island must undergo a swab test and provide a letter stating they are free of Covid-19.
It's unclear what the entry requirements will be if restrictions are lifted later this year, or whether Bali will accept travelers from regions badly affected by the pandemic.
Thailand has long been among the top destinations for travelers, receiving close to 40 million foreign tourists last year.
However, visitors have been banned from entering the Southeast Asian country since March because of the pandemic.
While the number of cases here has been relatively low in comparison to other destinations -- Thailand has reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases and over 50 deaths -- officials aren't taking any chances when it comes to reopening the country.
""It is still dependent on the outbreak situation, but I think the earliest we may see the return of tourists could be the fourth quarter of this year,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told CNN Travel.
The governor went on to stress there will be limitations on who can visit the country and what regions they can go to once restrictions are relaxed.
""We are not going to open all at once,"" he added. ""We are still on high alert, we just can't let our guards down yet. 
""We have to look at the country of origin [of the travelers] to see if their situation has truly improved."" 
This effectively means Thailand is unlikely to open its borders to travelers from destinations that don't appear to have the coronavirus situation under control.
Those that are given permission to enter may be offered ""long-stay packages"" in isolated areas ""where health monitoring can be easily controlled,"" such as the remote islands of Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Samui.
However, Thailand's borders are firmly shut for the time being. 
The ban on incoming international commercial flights -- excluding repatriation flights -- was recently extended until June 30 and Phuket International Airport remains closed.
Like many other global destinations, Thailand is currently focusing on domestic tourism.
In fact, some resorts and hotels have already been given the go ahead to reopen -- Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Bangkok, being one of them.
Shopping malls, museums, markets and some tourist attractions have also been reopening their doors, with Bangkok's Grand Palace due to reopen on June 4.
France was the most visited country in the world before the coronavirus pandemic.
Now, like the rest of the EU, restrictions are currently in place on all nonessential travel from outside the Schengen Zone (a grouping of 26 countries which normally have open borders). 
Travelers who do enter the country, with the exception of EU citizens or arrivals from the UK, will be subject to a compulsory 14-day coronavirus quarantine until at least July 24. 
Although the government is slowly lifting lockdown measures, with car journeys of up to 100 kilometers now allowed and beaches beginning to reopen, officials have made it clear the country is in no hurry to ease border restrictions for international travelers.
""Since the start of the crisis, the closure of the borders is the rule, and the authorization to cross a border is the exception. 
""What is good for tourism is often good for France, what strikes tourism strikes France,"" he said during a news conference.
Although some businesses have been given permission to reopen, the country's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafés are to remain closed at least until June 2.
Even then, it's unlikely establishments in Paris, which has been marked as a coronavirus ""red zone"" by officials, will be allowed to open any time soon.
It was announced on May 29 that the country's most visited museum, the Louvre, will reopen July 6. 
""Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,"" added Philippe. ""Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.""
He went on to state that residents can take holidays within France during July and August.
The country's hotels will be reliant on domestic tourism once they do reopen, as all signs suggest international travelers will not be able to enter for the foreseeable future.
""When the lockdown measures soften, French tourists are likely to want to stay close to home in the short term,"" a spokesperson for French hotel chain Accor told CNN Travel earlier this month.
""It will be the moment for them to rediscover their own country and we will be there to welcome them.""
Tourism accounts for almost 20% of Greece's gross domestic product, as well as one in five jobs, so it's perhaps no surprise the Mediterranean nation is angling to reopen to tourists as soon as it possibly can.
The European country, which managed to keep its coronavirus case numbers low by implementing a strict lockdown early on, plans to allow travelers back in on June 15.
""The tourism period begins on June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on May 20.
""Let us make this summer the epilogue of the [Covid-19] crisis,"" he added.
Mitsotakis went on to state that direct international flights to Greek destinations will slowly resume from July 1, and tourists will no longer be expected to take a Covid-19 test or go into quarantine on arrival.
However, Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis has indicated health officials will conduct spot tests when necessary.
""The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you've had in previous years,"" Mitsotakis told CNN earlier this month.
""Maybe no bars may be open, or no tight crowds, but you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece -- provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path.""
Bars and restaurants have also been allowed to take up business again, while city hotels are scheduled to reopen on June 1, followed by seasonal hotels in July.
All international passengers had previously been required to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival or go into quarantine for 14 days.
Mitsotakis had suggested tourists would be required to undergo testing before their visit as a further precaution in the future, but it seems this is no longer the case.
Although nonessential travel to Germany is prohibited at present, the land of poets and thinkers intends to lift restrictions for EU countries from June 15, according to German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.
Officials are also considering allowing entry to visitors from Turkey, the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, although a final decision is yet to be made.
The proposal was listed in a paper called ""Criteria for the Enabling of intra-European Tourism,"" which suggested the current travel warnings would be replaced by individual travel advice relating to each country. 
""The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries,"" it reads.
The Austria/Germany land border is also reopening -- travel between Austria and Germany will be possible from June 15 -- and restrictions around the country are being relaxed.
While bars are still closed, restaurants began reopening on May 18, while hotels were permitted to open up again from May 29.
Mexico is aiming to welcome visitors back within weeks.
While the nation remains in lockdown, with hotels and restaurants yet to recommence business, officials are planning to reopen the country bit by bit in order to get things back on track.
""The target is domestic travelers first, followed by travelers from the US and Canada and then the rest of the world.
The border between the US and Mexico border is closed to ""nonessential"" travel until at least June 22 and most international flights in and out of Mexico's key airports are currently suspended or significantly reduced.
However, Delta Air Lines will be increasing and/or resuming various services from the US to Cancun, Mexico City Los Cabos and Puerta Vallarta in the coming weeks.
Quintana Roo, a state on the Caribbean side of Mexico that's home to the likes of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, hopes to reopen in mid-June, according to Marisol Vanegas, the state's tourism secretary. 
""We want to revive tourism and expect to start opening sights and hotels sometime between June 10 and 15 but don't know which ones yet,"" she says. 
""It depends on what the federal government allows us to do.""
Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, says he hopes to be able to accept both international and domestic travelers by August and September.
However, beach destination Riviera Nayarit, situated north of Puerta Vallarta, currently has no immediate plans to bring back tourists, according to Richard Zarkin, the public relations manager for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Turkey made over $34.5 billion from tourism in 2019, and the transcontinental country is eager to get back in business.
According to Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the destination plans to restart domestic tourism by the close of May and hopes to receive international visitors from mid-June.
The country has set out new guidelines for its hotels and resort facilities, such as temperature checks at entrances and at least 12 hours of room ventilation after checkout. Guests will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.
""The more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,"" Tourism Minister Mehmet Ersoy told Reuters earlier this month while revealing plans to open around half of Turkey's hotels this year.
Meanwhile, restrictions on intercity travel have been lifted, while restaurants, cafes, parks and sports facilities are permitted to reopen from June 1, along with beaches and museums.
Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, one of the world's largest markets, is also preparing to reopen for the first time in two months on June 1.
Italy has been one of the destinations worst hit by the pandemic, but the hugely popular European country is keen to get its tourism industry up and running now that infection rates have slowed down.
Travelers from the EU, along with the UK and the microstates and principalities of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, will be allowed to enter without having to go into quarantine starting June 3, in a move the government has described as a ""calculated risk."" 
""We have to accept it; otherwise, we will never be able to start up again.""
Visitors were previously required to undergo a two-week quarantine before being allowed entry.
All museums, including Rome's Vatican Museums, have been slowly reopening throughout May with strict social-distancing rules. Bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with reduced numbers of diners as well as plastic shields to divide customers, on May 18.
Spain's lockdown was one of the toughest in Europe, but restrictions are gently being lifted. Beaches set to reopen in June while hotels in some parts of the country have already been permitted to resume business.
From July 1, the European destination, which welcomed a record 84 million visitors in 2019, will grant EU travelers permission to enter without having to quarantine for two weeks.
""Come July, we will allow the arrival of foreign tourists to Spain under safe conditions,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at a recent news conference.
""We will guarantee that tourists are not at risk, and that they don't represent a risk (to Spain).""
While there's been little mention of opening borders to travelers beyond the EU, it's thought Spain is hoping to follow the lead of destinations such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic by establishing safe corridors, or a ""travel bubble,"" with nearby destinations that have managed to keep the outbreak under control.
""The issue of borders will be accompanied by the evolution of the health crisis.""
At present, it's mandatory for anyone 6 and older to wear face masks while in public, both indoors and outdoors, ""where it is not possible to maintain [an interpersonal] distance.""
It's already one of the most lavish destinations in the world, but the Maldives looks set to become even more expensive to visit once it reopens.
The island nation, made up of over 1,000 islands, closed its national borders and canceled all flights shortly after recording its first two coronavirus cases in March.
The Maldives has recorded around 1,457 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19 so far.
According to Minister of Tourism Ali Waheed, the country could be in the position to receive tourists by the end of 2020.
""Within the next three months, the Maldives will become the first Covid-19 free country in the Asia region hopefully,"" during an online Maldivian parliament meeting.
""We are conducting surveys to begin safe tourism when we reach that road.""
A phased reopening has been proposed that would see private jets and super yachts allowed entry from June 1, charter flights and private jets will be charged a $50,000 landing fee.
The government has also issued a ""Safe Tourism License"" for tourist facilities that comply with government legislation and certain safety requirements, such as having a certified medic readily available and holding an ""adequate stock"" of PPE equipment.
Travelers who made the trip over will need to have a confirmed booking with a tourist facility with a ""Safe Tourism Licence,"" as well as a special $100 tourist visa available to those committed to spending a minimum of 14 days in the country.
Visitors will also need to present a valid medical certificate confirming they are Covid-19 free. 
The Maldives received more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019 and had been expected numbers to rise to two million in 2020.
St. Lucia is one of several Caribbean islands trying for a tourism comeback.
The tropical destination, which closed its orders to foreign travelers on March 23, is to begin its phased reopening on June 4, when it will lift it borders to visitors from the United States.
Those traveling to the country must present ""certified proof"" of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight.
Visitors will also be subject to screening and temperature checks by port health authorities and must wear face masks and maintain social distancing during their visit. 
Officials are also bringing in new safety measures for taxis to separate drivers and passengers.
""Our new protocols have been carefully crafted and will build confidence among travelers and our citizens,"" Minister of Tourism Dominic Fedee said in a statement. 
""The government of Saint Lucia remains resolved to protect both lives and livelihoods as it jump starts its economy.""
Local businesses have also been allowed to reopen, provided they have appropriate cleaning measures and social distancing measures in place.
Details of the second phase of the island's reopening, which is to begin on August 1, will be announced in the coming weeks.
Portugal is still in the process of relaxing lockdown restrictions, allowing restaurants, museums and coffee shops to reopen at reduced capacity from mid-May.
But the European country is keen to revive its struggling tourism industry, with Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva recently declaring ""tourists are welcome.""
While visitors from outside the EU are banned until at least June 15, some routes in and out of Portuguese-speaking nations such as Brazil are still operating.
The land border between Portugal and Spain, which has been closed to tourists since March, is unlikely to reopen until EU travel restrictions are lifted.
""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said earlier this month.
Although the prospect of reopening to international tourists appears to be a little while off, officials are putting measures in place to ensure foreign travelers will feel confident to return once they're able to.
Rita Marques, the country's Secretary of State for Tourism, has launched a ""don't cancel, postpone"" scheme, allowing tourists to reschedule any pre-arranged holidays to Portugal until the close of 2021.
This is valid for all bookings made through accredited travel agencies, along with hotels or Airbnbs, for trips scheduled between March 13 and September 30, 2020.
In addition, national tourism authority Turismo de Portugal has created a free hygiene-certification stamp to distinguish ""Clean &amp; Safe"" tourism enterprises to increase visitors' confidence.
Businesses will have to comply with hygiene and cleaning requirements for the prevention and control of Covid-19 to receive the stamp, which is valid for one year.
According to Santos Silva, Portugal's airports will soon be introducing health checks for arrivals, but visitors will not be subject to a mandatory quarantine.
The Caribbean island of Aruba is planning to open its doors to travelers once again at some point between June 15 and July 1.
However, the visitor's bureau for the Caribbean island, which has reported just over 100 confirmed coronavirus cases, says this ""tentative"" date may change if Aruba opts to ""consider additional precautionary measures as needed."" 
Although there's no mention of any Covid-19 testing requirements for arrivals, tourists will be required to undergo temperature checks on arrival.
While nonessential businesses including shopping malls, cinemas, beauty salons and outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen on May 25, the island country's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place.
This means such establishments are required to close by 10 p.m. every day.
In addition, the department of Public Health has introduced the ""Aruba Health &amp; Happiness Code,"" a mandatory cleaning and hygiene certification program for all businesses related to tourism in the country.
But the country was forced to close its winter resorts and place a ban on all foreign visitors back in March because of the crisis.
Eager to revive its tourism sector, the country's government says it plans to reopen to international travelers on July 1.
The next stage will allow for domestic travel in special ""safe"" tourism zones, while the final stage involves reopening borders and resuming some flights.
""[The] tourism sector will be first to which emergency relief measures will apply.""
While other destinations are relaxing travel restrictions and bringing in measures to lure travelers back, the UK is choosing to enact stricter regulations. 
Under the new rules, all arrivals will have to provide an address, at which they must remain for two weeks.
Those who break the rules will be subject to fines of up to $1,218.
The decision, which is to be reviewed every three weeks, has quashed any hopes of rescuing international tourism here in the coming weeks.
It's thought the move may discourage airlines from restarting flight operations swiftly, while officials have warned there's little chance of UK residents being able to go abroad this summer.
""I'm saying, right now you can't travel abroad,"" Transport Minister Grant Shapps said during a BBC television interview when asked whether UK citizens should book flights in July. 
""If you are booking it, you are clearly by very nature taking a chance of where the direction of this virus goes and therefore where the travel advice is in the future.""
At present, hotels are primed to open in early July, but as EU border restrictions are still in place, it's likely the UK will be focusing on domestic travel for now.
Luxury country house hotel Beaverbrook is one of many establishments eagerly waiting to be given the go ahead to open their doors again while implementing major changes to protect guests and staff.
""We're still awaiting further clarity from the government on when the hotel can reopen, but we have been working behind the scenes to adapt our operations to ensure extra safety for both our staff and guests when we do,"" a spokesperson from the Surrey hotel told CNN Travel earlier this month.
""All visitors and staff will be required to submit a temperature check on arrival and be asked to sanitize their hands when entering all buildings on the estate.

""Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills. Just like nobody should have to choose between staying home with Covid-19 symptoms or being able to afford rent or groceries,"" Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Monday. 
As of Monday, Canada has reported more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus and 6,545 related deaths. 
For those infected, sick leave is usually a provincial jurisdiction, which complicates the national effort. 
Trudeau said putting the necessary mechanisms in place for a national paid sick leave program would be challenging, but his government and the provinces are determined to try. 
""When the Fall comes and flu season starts up we don't want people who develop a sniffle to suddenly worry that while they really shouldn't go into work but they can't afford to not go into work and therefore the risk of contributing to a wave significantly, could be a real problem,"" Trudeau said. 
Canada's top doctor repeated her assertion Monday that a second wave of the virus could be worse than the first and encouraged public health officials to build up capacity for testing, hospital beds and personal protective equipment in order to prepare. 
""I think you can never be overly prepared and we have to just keep going with some of these capacity developments and that goes for lab testing as well,"" said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer during a press conference Monday. 
In hopes of managing the spread of the virus into the country, Trudeau announced last week that the border with the United States will continue to be closed until at least June 21. Trudeau called the border, which has been closed since March 21, a clear point of ""vulnerability"" for Canada.
The prohibition of international travelers and quarantine of returning Canadians is the only thing that has allowed Canada to manage its first wave of coronavirus, Tam said."

Those states are not reporting probable cases, according to the daily case count listed on the CDC's website. Probable cases include those that show evidence of an infection without the confirmation of a lab test and cases where coronavirus was listed as a cause or contributing cause of death but are not confirmed with a lab test. 
Some of the states with the largest populations -- like California, Florida, New York and Texas -- are among those listed as not reporting probable cases, despite CDC guidance that they should be included in the case count. 
This comes as 26 states see an increased or steady rate of new cases. Accurate rates of new cases are among the metrics that help officials track how the disease is spreading in the US and make decisions about how to reopen and loosen restrictions put in place to mitigate its impact. 
More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 111,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Though coronavirus reporting guidelines are voluntary, states not reporting probable cases likely undercount the number of people infected and make it difficult for officials to get the true picture of where the nation stands in the midst of a pandemic that has rocked almost every aspect of life. 
How will students go back to school?
Schools have been especially upended, with students across the country not having been on campus in months.
While many local governments have expressed that the path forward for the fall is unclear, North Carolina and California have released guidelines for reopening schools.
Though California's 1,000 school districts will make theirown decision about how and when to resume in-classroom learning, the state's Department of Education released a 62-page guidebook Monday to help them plan ahead of time.
The guide gives options for staggered schedules, ongoing distance learning, and models that combine both. It also directs educators to teach proper handwashing and limits the number of students allowed on buses to prevent the virus from breaking out in schools. 
""This guidance is only as good as what's implemented,"" State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said in a press conference. ""We expect it will be adjusted as we go.""
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also released health guidance for reopening schools Monday, telling reporters that this school year will be unlike any other.
""Students and staff will be screened for illness before they enter the school. Children will be asked to stay distant from classmates. They won't be sharing pencils or textbooks and there will be a lot of cleaning,"" he said.
Openings will be dependent on health metrics, he said. But North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Mandy Cohen said during a press conference Mondaythat she's concerned the state's positive tests are among the highest in the nation.
""These trends moving in the wrong direction is a signal we need to take very seriously,"" Cohen said.
California takes steps back toward normal 
While North Carolina is seeing cases rise, California -- with trends holding steady -- is beginning to reopen some recreational sites.
The state, which has been among those most affected, has 
Yosemite National Park, which has been off limits to visitors since March 20, will reopen to the public Thursday.
It will aim to admit only half of its average visitor rate, beginning by allowing 1,700 vehicle passes each day, according a statement from park spokesman Jamie Richards.
""There is no place like Yosemite, and we can't wait to welcome visitors back,"" said Acting Superintendent Cicely Muldoon. ""It's going to be a different kind of summer, and we will continue to work hand in hand with our gateway communities to protect community health and restore access to Yosemite National Park.""
As early as Friday, indoor California movie theaters may reopen, according to guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) released on Monday.
Theaters are required to limit attendees to 25% of capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower.
Theaters will also need to reconfigure seats to ensure physical distancing between moviegoers, who must wear face coverings when not eating or drinking to mitigate virus spread, the guidance says. 
Concerns raise in new states
As many of the hardest hit states begin to recover from the pandemic, cases rise elsewhere.
Vermont, where new cases are increasing, had an outbreak reported Friday with at least 62 people infected near Winooski, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said. Dozens of children were among those infected, and more than 1,000 people in the state went to get tested following the outbreak, Levine said. 
Vermont State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso said the outbreak was spread by friends and relatives, and through contact tracing it appears to be well-contained.
In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential."" The positive test rate doubled from one day to the next to 18.5%, she tweeted over the weekend.
""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health tweeted.
In the last week, Texas and Arizona have seen spikes in cases, with both reporting more than 1,000 new cases in one day. 
Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs -- including Arkansas State University, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.

Read her work at Travel-Sip-Repeat.com.
Today, Disney's Epcot and Hollywood Studios park opened their doors to guests for the first time since they closed on March 15. (Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom opened on July 11.)
Hollywood Studios is the only one of the four parks to reach its reservation capacity for opening day in Disney's new park reservation system. As of Thursday morning, it was booked and unavailable for the next eight days. None of the other parks have hit reservation capacity yet for any single day.
Sharp rise in Covid-19 cases
Disney is continuing with its reopening plan despite Florida's alarmingly high coronavirus infection numbers. 
The reopening of Epcot and Hollywood Studios also comes at a busy time for the global entertainment giant: Disneyland Paris in France opened earlier today while Disneyland Hong Kong had to close just shy of a month after reopening because of a surge of Covid-19 cases there.
Disney, though, maintains that its newly enhanced safety protocols -- such as hand sanitizer, mandatory masks and social distancing -- are sufficient protection to keep cast members (its term for employees) and guests safe in the Florida resort's hotels and theme parks. 
""The world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment that we're in,"" Josh D'Amaro, Disney chairman of Parks, Experiences and Products, told CNN Business on July 11. 
What we'll be watching today at Epcot
That may have been true of the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, where the focus is primarily on rides, but one of Epcot's main draws is its food and beverage offerings in the World Showcase.
In response to the pandemic closure, Disney is debuting the Taste of Epcot Food &amp; Wine Festival today instead of in September. The event, one of the most highly anticipated events in all of Disney's offerings, normally happens in the fall. 
Twenty pop-up kiosks offering themed food and drink menus are added to the park. 
The real question is this: How will Disney be able to enforce mask wearing during an event where guests are encouraged to stroll and graze? They likely won't wear masks while doing so, given that people are allowed to remove masks while eating or drinking.
In addition to the new festival, which also incorporates elements of the Epcot International Flower &amp; Garden Festival that was scheduled for the spring, the buzz in the park will be about the status of the park's renovation.
Earlier this year, there were many barricades around construction projects in Epcot as part of the major renovation Disney announced at the 2019 D23 event.
Two new rides are in process, including Remy's Ratatouille Adventure in the France Pavilion, originally scheduled to open this summer. 
Spaceship Earth, an original ride from Epcot's 1982 opening, was schedule to close for refurbishment in May to the dismay of many Disney purists, but it is now running as normal and the renovations are postponed.

The agency involved says it will continue to monitor the Trump International Hotel's compliance with Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser's regulations, which include the mandatory wearing of masks when inside businesses or the common areas of hotels.
The Washington Post first reported that the city had alerted the relevant channels after reports surfaced of Trump going without a mask at the hotel. John Falcicchio, Bowser's chief of staff, previously told the Post that regulators would be pursuing the accounts.
""We'll send it to our agencies,"" he told the paper. ""They'll look into it.""
CNN has reached out to Falcicchio for comment.
Jared Powell, spokesman for DC's Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, which investigates complaints about businesses not following the Covid-19 protection policy, told CNN that ""during the inspection, guests and staff were observed to be wearing face masks and coverings in compliance with the Mayor's Order.""
""Reports are only generated when violations are observed in person by an investigator,"" Powell added. ""ABRA will continue to monitor the establishment for compliance.""
Bowser tightened mask-wearing requirements in Washington on Wednesday after her move in May ordering the use of masks or face coverings when conducting essential business or travel and social distancing isn't possible.
The updated DC rules state that individuals ""must wear a cloth face covering or mask when inside of a business, office building, gym or other establishment open to the members of the public."" Specifically, related to hotels, the regulations say, ""Employees and guests must wear cloth face coverings.""
The President attended ""a roundtable with supporters of a joint fundraising committee,"" according to the White House, at the hotel on Monday night. Footage later surfaced of Trump not wearing wear a mask in the hotel's lobby. 
The revelation came after Trump had tweeted an image of himself wearing a face mask and indirectly called the act ""patriotic"" earlier Monday -- a clear change from his earlier reluctance to wear a facial covering in public.
Per a Republican National Committee spokesperson prior to the fundraiser, it was slated to raise $5 million for Trump Victory, his joint fundraising operation with the RNC and state party committees."

""I've always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages,"" he said in the clip posted Monday. ""I think many people, I struggle with my weight.""
Johnson says in the video that since recovering from the virus, he starts each day by going for a run with his dog, Dilyn, and talks effusively about the personal benefits of losing weight as well as the societal benefits of protecting the UK's National Health Service (NHS). 
The video has been released alongside the launch of the UK government's strategy to lower obesity rates in the country. According to government figures, 63% of adults are above what would be considered a healthy weight, with around half of those people being obese. 
Equally alarming is the fact that one in five children aged 10-11 are living with obesity, with children living in deprived areas twice as likely to be obese. 
The government policy paper, released Monday, makes a point of linking the risk of being overweight during the current pandemic. ""In the last few months we have seen that being overweight or living with obesity puts you at risk of dying from Covid-19,"" singling out the impact that ""excess fat tissue has on vital organs like the heart, lungs and liver.""
The government hopes this campaign will encourage those currently overweight to lose 2.5kg, claiming it ""could save the NHS £105 million [$135m] over the next 5 years."" The campaign comprises wide-ranging measures, from making restaurants put calorie numbers on menus to banning the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food on television and in shops. 
Johnson claims that these measures will help people across the country lose weight, ""not in an excessively bossy or nannying way, I hope."" However, Johnson himself has in the past opposed attempts by previous governments to take similar action. 
In 2007, Johnson wrote in a newspaper column that the incumbent Labour government's proposal to put calories on bottles of wine was ""loony"" and that the ""nannying and bullying"" plan could lead to a legal challenge. In 2004, when the same Labour government was planning a smoking ban, Johnson wrote: ""It's the dogooders I can't stand, and this Labour Government is riddled with people who long to stop other people doing things of which they disapprove."""

It was already an unforgettable day for owner David Fernandez, who for weeks had looked forward to reopening after the coronavirus stay-at-home order was lifted. 
But one customer's welcome back gift made the restaurant's return even more special for Fernandez and his employees. 
A man and his family, who had visited the restaurant before, on Friday ordered a filet mignon, scallops, grilled steak and other items. The check came out to a hefty $337. But then the customer asked his server to double charge him. 
The server, 18-year-old Josh Pikoff, had never received such a request, so he brought out Fernandez to help. 
""He said charge me double for everything and I asked, 'Are you sure?' Fernandez recalled. ""He said, 'yes.'
But after the customer received his updated check with the double charge, he then added a $300 tip for Pikoff and another $1,000 ""for the house,"" according to a picture of the check. His total came out to be $2,029. 
""I was really shocked at first because I didn't understand why he was giving it to me,"" Pikoff told CNN. ""But he said that he was extremely grateful that we were open and putting ourselves at risk to serve the community."" 
""I didn't really know what to say,"" Fernandez told CNN. ""It was extremely generous and I was just so wowed by it.""
The Frog &amp; The Bull, an Iberian-inspired tapas restaurant, wasn't even five-months-old when the coronavirus pandemic led to an early closure on St. Patrick's Day. 
Like most of the restaurant industry in the US, the restaurant was hit hard due to the coronavirus crisis, and Fernandez had to lay off most of his employees. 
The skeleton staff tried to keep the restaurant going with a carryout and delivery menu. But the momentum the restaurant had gained in its first five months was lost, and Fernandez said he and his staff were ""scraping for survival, literally from payroll to payroll.""
""We literally overnight reinvented ourselves from an upscale casual dining establishment into what I told my executive chef had to be a badass food truck without wheels,"" Fernandez said.
So when Texas' stay-at-home order expired on April 30 and establishments started opening back up Friday, Fernandez was excited. 
""We were well prepared to deal with all the advisories,"" he said. ""For example, we can only seat 25% max capacity so we have a very strict seating scheme that's timed out to keep people safe."" 
The extra money from the generous customer will help the restaurant get back on track with its bills, Fernandez said. 
While he doesn't know any further details about the customer, Fernandez said he will make sure the customer is well taken care of the next time he comes around."

 (CNN)For a minute there, it looked like we were all in this together. And then we weren't.
From embracing stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of Covid-19, we've come to see armed protesters storm state capitols to end the lockdown. Why has the attitude toward the pandemic crisis shifted so greatly?
Data emerged that, for the first time, specified infection and death rates by race -- and the face of the pandemic changed. It became Black. And the fragile sense of social solidarity that was keeping millions of Americans at home to protect themselves and each other began to crumble.
Throughout the 20th century -- and even today -- as Black people moved into previously segregated neighborhoods, the existing white residents moved out in large numbers. The coronavirus pandemic and worldwide lockdowns may be new to the globe, but the racial dynamics underlying our nation's response are wearyingly familiar.
I was not surprised to learn that Black people are the hardest-hit by the virus or the least-served by the institutions, systems, and leaders charged with addressing the pandemic. African Americans, who comprise 13% of the US population, make up nearly 28% of Covid-19 cases. 
We knew that people of color are overrepresented in poorly paid but suddenly essential frontline jobs, that African Americans are more likely to live in crowded housing making social distance difficult. We recognized that Black people tend to live in highly polluted neighborhoods resulting in higher rates than white people of the respiratory conditions that make patients most vulnerable to dying from Covid-19.
It wasn't a surprise to many of us that the shortage of hospitals and health care providers serving our communities, combined with the biased assumptions that lead doctors to undertreat Black people's pain and heart attacks, would result in African Americans finding it harder to get tested and treated. 
And we knew that as soon as the pandemic became racialized, many Americans would no longer be willing to make sacrifices in order to address a crisis that suddenly seemed to be not about ""us"" but about ""them."" 
Take a look at the timeline. On April 8, the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report showing that Black people were dramatically over-represented among Covid-19 patients sick enough to be hospitalized.
Five days later, on April 13, a small but furious group of protesters, virtually all white, some wearing MAGA hats, gathered outside the Ohio statehouse to demand Gov. Mike DeWine reopen the state.
It didn't stop there. From Texas to North Carolina the protesters gathered -- organized by right-wing groups and supported by Republican legislators, including the president -- many wearing Trump gear, and some displaying Confederate flags and brandishing automatic weapons. The same scene repeated on April 30 in Michigan, when armed protesters stormed the state house and tried to push their way in. 
A Fox Nation host likened the nation's stay-at-home orders to ""willful slavery"" in a since-deleted tweet. A state senator in Michigan made the connection eloquently but silently, by wearing onto the legislative floor a face mask that resembled the Confederate flag.
This racialization of public events is nothing new. From former President Richard Nixon's war on drugs, which a top aide later acknowledged was designed to criminalize Nixon's ""two enemies: the antiwar left and black people;"" to former President George H.W. Bush's use in 1988 of the infamous ""Willie Horton"" campaign ad, which became the very definition of a racist dog whistle; to the Russians swamping social media with posts about the Black Lives Matter movement in order to drive white voters to Trump in 2016, racist scare tactics have long been used to pit Americans against one another. During this pandemic, racism has already been weaponized to splinter any national unity. 
Lives and livelihoods are at stake, most acutely in Black and brown communities -- but so is our democracy. We are seeing high levels of scarcity, with extreme unemployment numbers, while the nation's chief executive uses his bully pulpit to sow division and demonize otherness. With the elections approaching, our country could sink to a level of tribalism that leads to violence. 
We could make this another instance of white flight -- from public health realities, from collective responsibility, from the recognition that the pandemic imperils people of all colors and communities. Or we could answer the call to rise together and fight the pandemic, using science and reason as our guides and democracy as our beacon.
Our nation's fractured history does not need to be our destiny. As the virus burns through our communities, upending life as we knew it, let's take this chance to reject the habits of hatred and move forward together, rebuilding our country and a future in which health and economic mobility are within reach for us all."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)Washing your hands frequently, with plenty of water and soap, is one of the simplest and most effective measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Yet due to a lack of water supply and indoor plumbing, three-quarters of households in the developing world won't be able to follow this advice, Tim Wainwright of the nonprofit WaterAid told The Guardian, because they lack some place to wash with soap and water. How will they cope when the pandemic escalates and there is no clean water to help stop contagion?
This is not a faraway problem. The pandemic may be raging in Europe and the US, but it is spreading across Asia, Africa and Latin America, from where it may yet return to strike the Northern Hemisphere again. This pandemic is a global threat, and it will not be defeated until our most vulnerable communities are safe. One of the crucial ways of keeping them safe is to ensure they have access to safe water and sanitation; never has the sixth UN Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to ensure just this by 2030, been more vital for saving and protecting lives. 
Here is the scale of the problem: Every year, 1.5 million young children die of preventable infectious diseases such as diarrhea because of poor sanitation, according to UNICEF. One out of every three humans on our planet -- some 2.2 billion people -- lack access to safe drinking water, and six out of 10 lack access to proper sanitation, meaning toilets or safely managed sewage systems. Residents of the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, can share one pit latrine with over 100 people. In Dharavi, Asia's largest urban slum located in Mumbai, India, 80% of its seven million residents have no running water, the National Observer has noted. What hope do they have of washing their hands frequently?
Even before Covid-19 struck, the UN called water scarcity ""the scourge of the earth."" Because of climate change and the depletion of fresh water resources, two-thirds of humanity could be living in water-stressed areas (facing water shortfalls not as severe as those deemed water ""scarce"") just five years from now, according to UN projections. Two years ago, Cape Town in South Africa came perilously close to ""Day Zero"" -- the day its 3.7 million residents would run out of water. Strict water rationing has been the order of the day ever since. Water scarcity increases the burden on the poorest of the poor -- women who must walk for miles to find water and carry it back to their homes. And, of course, water scarcity makes the challenge of delivering clean water and sanitation much more complex.
 The problem, shockingly, is not confined to poor countries. More than two million Americans live without running water, indoor plumbing or wastewater treatment, according to the nonprofits Dig Deep and the US Water Alliance. A report by Food &amp; Water Watch found that, in 2016, 15 million Americans had their water shut off due to an inability to pay water bills -- one out of every 20 households across the country. The US neither provides a constitutional right to water nor recognizes the UN Human Right to Water and Sanitation.
The truth is that in every country, water infrastructure -- where it is present -- is deteriorating. Underinvestment in water networks and treatment facilities has been the norm for decades. We are a long way off being able to meet the UN's water goals for 2030.
But investing in clean water infrastructure saves lives, and we must seize this moment to ramp up investment in safe water and sanitation. Spending on water is not just the right thing to do; it's also the smart thing to do.
The World Resources Institute estimates that it would cost just over 1% of global GDP to invest in the infrastructure required to provide clean water for all countries by 2030. By contrast, diseases linked to contaminated water cost many countries up to 5% of GDP due to poor health and lost productivity.
According to the UN, every $1 invested in safe drinking water in urban areas yields more than $3 in saved medical costs and added productivity, on average. For every $1 invested in basic sanitation, society makes $2.50 back. The return is higher in rural areas, with $7 gained or saved for every $1 invested in clean drinking water.
If countries have neglected to invest in their water security up to now, it is mostly because they have not seen it as a priority, either from a health or economic point of view. Covid-19 changes that equation. The human and economic cost of a pandemic aggravated by water scarcity could be catastrophic. 
Without clean water and proper sanitation, we will not be able to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. Like Covid-19, water scarcity is a global problem that needs collective action. Never has there been a more urgent time to address the world's water crisis."
10,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Nicole Chavez, CNN",This machine became his last chance for survival while fighting Covid-19,Doctors in Arizona doubted that Dr. Karl Viddal was going to make it. The ventilator was running at its highest setting and still wasn't enough for his lungs.,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/health/coronavirus-ecmo-patient/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200526173339-01-ecmo-coronavirus-patients-super-tease.jpg,2020-05-27T13:10:27Z,"(CNN)Doctors in Arizona doubted that Dr. Karl Viddal was going to make it. The ventilator was running at its highest setting and still wasn't enough for his lungs. 
The 46-year-old family medicine physician was sick with Covid-19 when he was admitted to a Phoenix hospital in March and his condition quickly got worse. They sedated him, put him on a ventilator and tried placing him on his stomach -- a method known as prone positioning, which has helped some coronavirus patients -- but nothing was working. 
With nothing else to try, doctors turned to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, a complicated technique that's not widely available in the United States. 
The ECMO machine, often called the ""highest form of life support,"" uses a pump to circulate a patient's blood through an artificial lung. The artificial lung adds oxygen and takes out carbon dioxide before the blood is returned to the patient. ECMO helps provide enough oxygen to a patient while allowing time for the lungs or heart to rest and heal.
The process is challenging and increases the patient's risk for clotting and bleeding, but doctors in the United States and around the world are using it to treat some severe cases of Covid-19.
""I'm pretty sure (that) without ECMO, he wouldn't be with us today,"" said Dr. Ross Bremner, who treated Viddal at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center. 
'He most likely would have died,' doctor says
Viddal, a father of three, considered himself an active and healthy person. He had his gall bladder removed and suffered a common cold once in a while, but he never imagined he would spend nearly two months hospitalized. 
After returning from a trip to Colombia, Viddal developed a cough. Within days, he had difficulties breathing and developed a fever. He became worried and went to the hospital after he checked his oxygen levels and they kept dropping.
""I was taking shallow breaths,"" Viddal said. ""I was hoping that I would recover and it would resolve (itself).""
Viddal says he was intubated one or two days after he was admitted in the hospital. But no one knew he had Covid-19 for some time. 
He says he tested negative for the virus three times when they used nasal swabs and finally tested positive when doctors took a sample from his lungs. Bremner, the executive director for the Norton Thoracic Institute at St. Joseph's, says the virus had moved to Viddal's lungs.
Viddal was placed on the ECMO machine for 16 days, Bremner says, and developed other complications, including blood clots, bleeding from his main airway, tension pneumothorax -- a dangerous accumulation of air -- and deep vein thrombosis. 
""It was really a tough situation,"" Bremner said. ""We know that, you know, about half of the patients who go on ECMO for Covid (19) don't survive and he certainly had many brushes with death.""
By the time Viddal was taken off the ECMO machine and the ventilator, he had lost 50 pounds and could barely move. Despite everything, he says he didn't have heart, kidney or liver damage. 
""I feel truly blessed that I was able to get onto that intervention to help save my life,"" Viddal said.
More patients are being treated with ECMO
At the time, Viddal was only the second Covid-19 patient in Arizona to be placed on ECMO therapy, according to the Dignity Health hospital system. 
Bremner said his team had mostly used the ECMO machine for organ transplants and to treat some severe cases of H1N1 influenza.
""It's not that common to use ECMO in other viral illnesses,"" Bremner said. 
The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, an international nonprofit consortium of health care institutions that evaluates therapies to support failing organ systems, has been tracking patients with severe cases of Covid-19.
So far, at least 1,006 people who tested positive for Covid-19 or are suspected of having the virus have been placed on an ECMO machine in hospitals worldwide, ELSO says.
Of the 260 patients in North America who have been put on an ECMO machine and then removed from it, 144, or 55% survived, the organization says.
The US Food and Drug Administration issued guidance in April to help expand the availability of equipment used for ECMO therapy for coronavirus patients. 
The agency says long-term extracorporeal oxygenation ""can be an important tool for treating patients"" and the FDA ""recognizes the importance and utility of increased availability of extracorporeal oxygenation devices for patients during the COVID-19 public health emergency.""
Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health said it has not issued guidance about the routine use of this treatment, saying ""there is no conclusive evidence that ECMO is responsible for better clinical outcomes in patients who received ECMO than in patients who did not receive ECMO.""

17,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Ryan Prior, CNN","Chronic fatigue syndrome a possible long-term effect of Covid-19, experts say","Terri Wilder became dreadfully ill in 2014, falling asleep immediately each day after she got home from work and laying in bed all weekend, recovering just enough to drag herself to work the next week.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/health/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-covid-19-survivors-wellness/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200805202305-covid-patient-icu-houston-restricted-super-tease.jpg,2020-08-07T11:21:10Z,"(CNN)Terri Wilder became dreadfully ill in 2014, falling asleep immediately each day after she got home from work and laying in bed all weekend, recovering just enough to drag herself to work the next week.
""I could barely raise my hand to hail a cab,"" she said.
After nearly two years, Wilder was diagnosed with a disease called myalgic encephalomyelitis, also called chronic fatigue syndrome, a neuroimmune condition with symptoms including brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, immune aberrations and post-exertional malaise.
She had worked for decades as a social worker and activist for marginalized communities, focusing on HIV research and education programs and LGBTQ health. Wilder was shocked to find that ME/CFS lacked a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and scientists studying the disease only received about $5 million annually in research funding from the National Institutes of Health.
At that point, she found herself in an altogether new marginalized disease community, reminiscent of the stigmatized groups she fought for at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. 
A chronic disease, ME/CFS can last for decades. It often takes root following some form of viral infection, for instance Epstein-Barr virus or Ross River virus. The novel coronavirus is just one more virus that can potentially trigger the onset of this debilitating condition. 
Wilder fears that hundreds of thousands of people with Covid-19 could develop the same illness plaguing her. And leading medical experts have the same concern.
""Even after you clear the virus, there are post-viral symptoms. I know, because I follow on the phone a lot of people who call me up and talk about their course,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a July 17 interview with Medscape.
""It's extraordinary how many people have a postviral syndrome that's very strikingly similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.""
Many are falling ill and staying ill
More than six months into the global coronavirus crisis, many who contract Covid-19 are not fully recovering. 
Up to 35% of those diagnosed with Covid-19 were not back to their normal selves two to three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus, according to a July 24 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Of the 292 people the CDC surveyed on post-Covid recoveries, those recovering from Covid-19 reported a median of seven of the CDC's 17 symptoms. 
Thirty-five percent reported fatigue. And one in five younger people ages 18 to 34 without any other chronic medical conditions reported they had not fully recovered.
One of those still struggling with symptoms months later is CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who first announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31.
Speaking on his show on July 14, he noted that myalgic encephalomyelitis had been suggested to him as a reason why he hasn't fully recovered.
""I've got brain fog that won't go away,"" Cuomo said. ""I've got an onset of clinical depression, which is not sadness. People keep saying to me, 'Don't be sad.' I'm not sad. I'm depressed. It's different. I can't control it.""
Cuomo has regularly talked on air about his battle with Covid-19, and he's conversed with viewers on Twitter about his journey, many of whom say their Covid-19 symptoms are lingering, too.
""I can't recover from workouts the way I did before,"" he continued.
Failure to recover from exercise, or post-exertional malaise, is often considered a hallmark ME/CFS symptom, according to a 2015 report by the National Academy of Medicine. That report also estimated that 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS, although most are not diagnosed.
At present, ME/CFS is estimated to have a $17 billion to $24 billion impact on the US economy, based on medical bills and patients' lost income due to many being unable to work, according to the CDC.
If you have chronic Covid-19, it's important to rest
Living with ME/CFS, seeing Covid-19 pillage her city and reading press reports of Covid-19 patients not recovering has left Wilder on edge.
She has been using all her connections from her career in public health to help raise the alarm about chronic symptoms that so-called Covid ""long-haulers"" are likely to face for months or years to come.
On Friday, Wilder is facilitating a webinar for people facing the lingering effects of Covid-19. That event, in collaboration with the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Action Network, sold out quickly with minimal advertising, showing her that there's likely a big need for the information she and ME/CFS clinicians are providing.
""The first thing that terrifies me is 'Don't exercise.' You can make yourself sicker,"" Wilder said. ""This is something that everyone with ME wishes that somebody had told them in advance. We don't want people to go through the things that we did.""
Those with ME/CFS should prioritize activity management, or pacing, the CDC recommends. This means you should understand your physical and cognitive limits, and not push beyond them, as this will result in a crash, setting you back on your recovery. ""Some patients and doctors refer to staying within these limits as staying within the 'energy envelope,'"" the agency said.
Researchers are monitoring how patients' symptoms progress
A number of research and support groups are setting up to help people struggling with long-term Covid-19 symptoms and to explore how and why immune system abnormalities might lead to ME/CFS.
More than 14,000 people have joined an online Covid-19 support group on the website of Body Politic, which describes itself as a queer feminist health collective and media company. The community offers insights for those who have tested positive, are experiencing symptoms or are recovering from Covid-19. And it contains special sections for those whose Covid symptoms have lasted beyond 30 or 90 days.
Members of Congress are taking notice as well.
Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maine is co-sponsoring a bill, HR 7057, the ""Understanding Covid-19 Subsets and ME/CFS Act."" The proposed legislation calls for $60 million in federal funding, or $15 million annually through 2024, for projects including data collection, collaborative research centers and a medical research program to be executed by the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
One of the groups that would likely vie for additional federal resources is the Open Medicine Foundation, a collaborative of scientists focusing on ME/CFS research with centers at Stanford University and Harvard University.
The group launched a study of Covid-19 patients that will monitor how their disease and its possible aftereffects, specifically chronic conditions that might occur after an illness, evolve. The researchers will analyze patients' genomes, as well as complete protein and metabolism profiles at regular intervals.
""Covid-19 gives us an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of post-viral disease,"" said Dr. Ami Mac, the director of translational medicine at the Stanford Genome Technology Center, which is associated with the OMF. 
""This could result in a longstanding public health disaster leaving in its wake untold numbers of new sufferers of a condition that feels like a 'living death' for those of us afflicted,"" Mac, who has ME/CFS, said.
In the next couple weeks, she hopes to finish building an app by which researchers can follow Covid-19 patients and the symptoms, tracking how and when they develop symptoms consistent with ME/CFS.
""We plan to obtain blood samples over a few years longitudinally to allow us to see which molecular changes occur that prevent resolution of symptoms,"" she said.
Both Mac and Wilder plan to keep dedicating themselves as strong advocates for Covid-19 long-haulers who need all the support, scientifically and socially, that they can get.
One way Wilder did that was by asking Fauci a question about ME/CFS and Covid-19 at a July 9 news conference organized by the International AIDS Society. 
Fauci's acknowledgement of the link garnered international headlines, and afterwards he went on to compare the two conditions publicly on at least two other occasions last month. 
""Because of my HIV background and my knowledge of social activist groups like Act Up, I just quickly realized we have to work together and I have to take advantage of every opportunity available to me,"" Wilder said."

And any other experimental drugs should only be tried as part of a clinical trial, the panel said.
The guidelines, published online, are meant to guide doctors, nurses and other medical professionals treating patients with Covid-19 and will be updated in real time as more is learned in fighting the pandemic, the NIH said.
Trump has touted an antimalarial drug known as hydroxychloroquine, especially in combination with an antibiotic azithromycin, for treating Covid-19 even though there has been no medical recommendation to use it. Although a few very small studies have suggested it might help patients recover, more and more studies have shown that the drug combination may do little or no good and may increase the rate of other complications.
Asked about the NIH guidance on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin during Tuesday's White House coronavirus task force meeting, President Trump said, ""we'll take a look at that. I'm always willing to take a look.""
The guidelines give details on which drugs should be used, but also when and how to provide extra oxygen to patients struggling to breathe, how to safely use equipment on potentially infectious patients and include what's known about heart, liver and kidney complications in patients.
The panel, made of up experts from the federal government, universities and professional medical societies, notes that no drug has yet been shown to help patients recover from Covid-19. No drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Covid-19.
""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"" one of the recommendations reads.
""If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used, clinicians should monitor the patient for adverse effects,"" it adds -- including an abnormal heart reading.
""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the group adds.
The panel also urges caution in another treatment making headlines: the use of plasma from Covid-19 survivors. ""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of COVID-19,"" it said.
Survivors have been clamoring to donate blood in the hope that antibodies produced by their immune systems could help new patients recover from quickly from infection, but no one has finished a clinical trial to show whether the treatment actually helps and if so, how much plasma to use or which antibodies to filter out and administer.
Likewise, the group recommends caution in the use of drugs aimed at tamping down the immune response in patients at risk of cytokine storms, and it warned against using some immune-suppressing drugs such as Janus kinase inhibitors of JAK-inhibitors, often used for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions.
The panel specifically recommends against using the combination of hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin because of potential toxic side-effects, except as part of a clinical trial. It also recommends against a combination of the HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and other HIV drugs that stop viruses from replicating.
Patients can experience septic shock and an immune overreaction known as a cytokine storm, the guidelines say. And several reports show about 20% of critically ill patients suffer an inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue known as myocarditis, as well as heart rhythm dysfunction and other injuries to the heart. Liver and kidney problems are also common among very sick patients, with one report that 15% of patients with critical disease need an intense form of dialysis known as continuous renal replacement therapy.
There are recommendations also for helping the burdened lungs of Covid-19 patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS.
""Currently there is no evidence that ventilator management of patients with ARDS due to Covid-19 should differ from management of patients with viral pneumonia due to influenza or other respiratory viruses,"" the panel said.
Despite a few reports about patients who get a treatment that uses a pump to circulate their blood through an artificial exterior lung, called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, there's not enough evidence to recommend it, the group said
And health workers should be careful to wear the correct protective gear, such as fit-tested N95 respirator masks, when performing certain procedures that can shoot tiny particles of virus-carrying material, known as aerosols, into the air.

So what happens when you're quarantined in a crumbling home in a remote village where you barely speak the language and can't get home to your loved ones? Does life quickly become a nightmare?
Perhaps surprisingly given the hardships that followed, the answer seems to be no. 
CNN spoke to a few people who bought some of the Italian homes being offered cheaply by towns wanting to reverse declining population trends. 
We found them feeling upbeat and eager to complete their property remodeling and make their Italian dream come true.
Despite the unexpected turn of events, it seems being stuck in Italy hasn't been such a negative experience after all. 
And the virus crisis has made them appreciate even more the beauty of Italy's rural villages -- so much so that some are looking to invest in more cheap properties. 
Miami-based artist Alvaro Solorzano is currently stuck in Mussomeli, a picturesque town in the southern island of Sicily where last year he purchased two cheap properties -- one of them costing just one euro, or a little over a dollar. 
In March he arrived with his wife, son and son's girlfriend to start renovating the houses. The other three headed back to Miami and Solorzano was due to follow them a couple of weeks later, but then his flight was canceled. 
""I lost track of time. We came here together and I ended up living the quarantine in Mussomeli all by myself, without any furniture just a bed and TV, and nobody to talk to,"" he tells CNN. ""That was the hardest thing. Had my wife or son been with me, it would have been different.""
Solorzano had been staying in a B&amp;B, but when this closed because of Covid-19 restrictions, he was forced to move into the less dilapidated of his two properties, which was just about habitable. 
Since then, he's been killing time by watching TV, learning Italian, going to the supermarket (""the nicest part of the day"") and talking on the phone with his family. Little by little, he's been making the most out of the situation by repairing and painting the walls of the house. 
""I did little things but it helped me use time, so when my son and his girlfriend come back their home will be ready,"" he says. ""Luckily the hardware store in town has always been open and I'm so glad we bought two properties and not just the one euro house as it has no water nor electricity."" 
Despite an initial hardship, he says his new neighbors helped him throughout the ordeal. 
""The first two nights were terrible,"" he says. ""It was cold, I slept with my jacket on top of my pajamas but then the neighbors were great. I can't complain. They gave me heaters and even offered blankets, which I had, but I could use their internet."" 
""They kept checking in on me, brought me tons of food for Easter which took me three days to eat. I don't know what I would have done without them.""
Mussomeli, surrounded by honeysuckle and eucalyptus trees, boasts one of Italy's most breathtaking fortresses, known as the Enchanted Castle, which clings like a spider on a pointed rock.
The fertile green farmland is dotted with old sulfur mines, sanctuaries, Roman necropolises and traces of primitive settlements.
The town's name means ""Hill of Honey"" in Latin.
But to Solorzano the sweetest attractions of the place are its welcoming residents. 
""They're wonderful, I know everyone by name,"" he says. ""There's Mario, the guy who delivers the bread. I've got no words to describe how grateful I am of having them and don't know how I could ever repay them for all they did."" 
Initially tough restrictions have now eased in Italy, allowing him to walk around, but at first it was hard, he admits, as there was nothing to do. ""It was terrible, just staying at home, I felt like being in jail sometimes."" 
Now he relishes being able to chat to locals and stroll to Mussomeli's viewpoint, where he can sit on a bench and enjoy fresh air and mountain panoramas. 
As a painter, Solorzano says he would've loved doing some artwork, but due to the lockdown he couldn't find a pallet or a canvas. 
""I'm working hard to try to get back home, but a flight which I recently booked has also been canceled so I really don't know when I will return to the States,"" he says. ""I want to be back before Father's Day in June. I've already missed so many festivities I could have celebrated with my family.""
Solorzano's Sicilian quarantine has made him love Mussomeli even more. The ordeal, instead of having killed enthusiasm for his one euro house adventure, has fueled a desire to purchase a third abandoned building. 
""I love this town and the people, even if they don't know you, they help you out. It's like being in another world. You don't get this in the States"". 
Brazilian businessman Douglas Roque is another dilapidated home purchaser whose enthusiasm for starting a new life has been undimmed by coronavirus. 
Roque was in Fabbriche di Vergemoli, Tuscany, overseeing the renovation of a one euro farm dwelling when lockdown struck and his flight back home was canceled. 
Together with his Brazilian-Italian friend Alberto Da Lio, both from Sao Paulo, the two were also in town to oversee the potential purchase of an entire abandoned area for other Brazilian buyers. 
Had they not been able to stay at Da Lio's family house near Venice, with hotels in Vergemoli shut and the abandoned dwelling totally uninhabitable, they would have had nowhere to go, says Roque. 
Fabbriche di Vergemoli is a cluster of hamlets scattered in the UNESCO-listed protected forest of the Apuan Alps. The area is dotted with ruins of abandoned miners' dwellings overrun by vegetation. Many areas can be reached only by foot. 
Roque's dilapidated three-story farm, which comes with a chestnut cellar and forgotten old wine barrels, is located in the neighborhood of Dogana, where a pristine stream runs below an ancient, picturesque bridge.
""I was about to start the restyle and then everything was blocked,"" says Roque. ""It was terrible, our return flight was canceled and we had issues with the Brazilian consulate.
""I came here in February to pursue the renovation of my house, all the paperwork was done, I was ready to go but couldn't move on with it. And my family is in Brazil, where virus cases have been increasing. I'm worried for them and they're worried for me."" 
The two friends also had to deal with the consequences of a prolonged stay: the hassle of credit card monthly limits and seasonal clothing changes as they arrived in winter and it is now almost spring (luckily, they found some lighter gafrments at Da Lio's). 
While he waits for global air traffic to resume, Roque's anxious to set foot again in Vergemoli as soon as Italian authorities lift restrictions on moving between regions -- a move expected in early June. 
""All this time I've been trying to work on my project online, contacting construction companies and liaising with other Brazilian buyers, friends and relatives interested in buying property in Vergemoli but who can't travel now. I hope to finalize everything soon."" 
Roque says he picked Vergemoli of all places in Italy to buy a one euro house because, despite all that's happened, it remains a dream destination.
""Tuscany is a marvelous region and major historical and artistic cities are nearby. It's the perfect spot."""

Hong Kong (CNN) On June 18, Hong Kong Disneyland will become the world's second Disney park to reopen. 
One of the smallest Disney theme parks, it closed on January 26 due to the global coronavirus crisis and has remained shut since then, with a few exceptions -- namely its hotels and a few on-site restaurants. 
Shanghai Disneyland was the first park to reopen, welcoming guests back on May 11. Its reopening gave clues as to what Disney parks around the world would look like post-coronavirus, with social distancing regulations enforced and both guests and employees (aka cast members) sporting face masks. 
And it looks like Hong Kong Disneyland will follow similar procedures.
Guests will be required to book reservations online at least one week in advance in order to maintain crowd control. Upon arrival, they will have to submit to temperature checks, fill out a health declaration form and wear face masks. 
Magic Access members, who are the park's annual pass holders, will get priority for booking reservations. 
""We are proud to be part of the Hong Kong community, which has worked hard and shown fortitude in how it has handled the pandemic,"" Stephanie Young, the park's managing director, said in a statement. 
Another major component of the Disney experience, character interactions, has changed for the coronavirus era. For now, guests won't be able to have up-close experiences like photo ops with Mickey, Minnie and company but will be able to enjoy socially distanced activities like parades and shows.
Since the virus was first identified in January, Hong Kong was quick to enact social hygiene measures. Currently, the city has recorded only 1,110 cases and just four deaths.
While waiting for crowds to return, Hong Kong Disneyland has been continuing work on its newest attraction, the Castle of Magical Dreams. Though it isn't complete yet, visitors will be able to see the castle's progress as it enters its final phase of construction.
Hong Kong Disneyland is also hard at work on a new ""Frozen"" themed section, with an area themed around Elsa, Anna, Olaf and the other characters from the current record holder for highest-grossing animated film ever.
Outside of greater China, though, Disney fans will still have to wait to get their theme park fix. Disney's parks in California, Florida, Japan and France are currently closed."

The news Wednesday came a day after the league announced the 2020 regular season will start in July, with the players' association accepting health and safety protocols to guide the return to play. The US on Tuesday also saw the third-highest number of new Covid-19 cases reported in one day since the pandemic began.
A Detroit Tigers player and a staff member outside the baseball operations department each tested positive for Covid-19, general manager Al Avila told reporters Wednesday. The player, who tested positive in the last few days, was in Florida but not at the team's spring training facility in Lakeland, Avila said, according to MLB.com.
""They're going through the process of recovering as we speak, and that's really all I can say about that at this point,"" Avila said, per MLB.com. ""It was just a few days ago, so they're still in the recovery stages, and at some point, they'll be tested again.""
The Seattle Mariners have had ""more than one"" player test positive for Covid-19, general manager Jerry Dipoto said Wednesday to reporters. 
""A lot of that is obviously going to be protected information, but we've had more than one player in our organization test positive,"" Dipoto said, according to MLB.com. 
""We're not yet sure, with testing coming this weekend, how much of that will affect our 40-man roster. But with the cases popping up, especially in some of the hot spots around the country, we have had a few players test positive,"" he said. 
""Right now they're asymptomatic. They feel great. But we are aware that they're positive, and obviously they'll not be in the environment when we open up until we've determined whether, A) they're part of the roster group, and B) they're healthy enough to be a part of that.""
A player on the Boston Red Sox's 40-man roster has tested positive for Covid-19, Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom told reporters Wednesday. The player was exposed to the virus a couple weeks ago, Bloom said, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. 
Blue Jays and Rockies also have positive cases
There are also positive Covid-19 cases stemming from testing last week at the Toronto Blue Jays facilities in Dunedin, Florida, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN on Wednesday. The source did not specify the number of positive cases and did not say if any of the positive cases are players
On Friday, the Blue Jays had said in a statement that they had closed the club's spring training facilities in Dunedin after a player experienced symptoms associated with Covid-19.
Three Colorado Rockies players tested positive for the coronavirus last week, according to multiple reports.
One player was symptomatic while the other two were asymptomatic, the reports say. 
Several Rockies players have been taking live at-bats and working out at the team's stadium, Coors Field, this month, according to the Denver Post.
The other players working out at the ballpark were tested for the virus and received negative test results, the Denver Post reports.

Tom Barrett, an impassioned critic of the governor's pandemic orders, announced Sunday that he has contracted coronavirus.
Barrett, who is still an active part-time helicopter pilot in the Michigan Army National Guard, received the positive result during a routine screening before an upcoming training event, according to a press release from his office. 
The Republican lawmaker said that he does not have any ""significant symptoms"" and will self-isolate.
""I have done my best to make contact with those I have been around in the past couple weeks so that they may also seek medical advice,"" Barrett said. ""I look forward to resuming my normal work schedule as quickly as possible."" 
Barrett has accused Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, of greatly overstepping her powers, and sponsored a bill limiting her emergency powers. 
""Michigan families are hurting. Jobs have been lost, and unemployment is soaring. Reasonable accommodations can be made to begin to reopen the state, but the governor has been unwilling to work with us,"" Barrett said in May.
Whitmer, who announced a state lockdown in March and lifted it in June, has faced backlash regarding her closure orders. Last month, she called for a ""national mask-up campaign,"" saying it is necessary for everyone, even those in the White House, to wear masks to stem the spread of coronavirus as the number of cases surge across the US.
In April, protesters carrying firearms descended on Michigan's Capitol to pressure the governor to issue more relaxed measures. President Donald Trump has also attacked Whitmer, a first-term governor, in personal terms over her criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Barrett is a supporter of Unlock Michigan, ""a coalition of concerned Michiganders who believe that Governor Gretchen Whitmer's crushing lockdown of life and business across Michigan is a dangerous threat to our livelihoods and constitutional liberties,"" according to the group's website. 
He held a petition signing event for the campaign on July 18, The Detroit News reported.
Following Barrett's coronavirus news, other state lawmakers are suggesting people who may have been exposed get tested.
In a statement to CNN, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich said he is ""encouraging members and staff to seek testing if they have any concerns about potential exposure.""
""Thanks to the hard work of Gov. Whitmer and local health officials, testing is available and should be utilized,"" he said in the statement. ""This is an important reminder to everyone that we must continue to be diligent about wearing masks, social distancing and hand washing, because those carrying COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic.""
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey also encouraged all caucus members to be tested. He announced Monday that legislative sessions have been canceled this week.
Amber McCann, a spokeswoman for Shirkey, told CNN on Monday that ""no other senators or staff have reported a positive test.""
CNN's Lauren M. Johnson contributed to this report."

This surge comes as President Jair Bolsonaro's spokesman, Gen. Otavio Santana do Rego Barros, confirmed he tested positive for Covid-19. 
Yet Bolsonaro said earlier this week he believed ""the worst had passed"" for the coronavirus pandemic, during a press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. But as the number of cases and deaths continue to climb, many health experts fear the worst is yet to come.
Since Bolsonaro made the comment in Brasilia on Tuesday, there have been more than 20,000 new cases of coronavirus and the country registered 610 deaths on Thursday, nearly the highest toll yet in a 24-hour period, according to the Health Ministry.
Health Minister Nelson Teich said Thursday that stricter lockdowns may be needed in some of the hardest-hit regions, during a video conference with members of the lower house of Congress. 
Former Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said ""the toughest months"" are likely to be May and June, during an interview with TV Globo last month, four days before he was fired by Bolsonaro over disagreements on the country's coronavirus strategy.
Warnings of a 'total collapse'
Meanwhile, Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat coronavirus presents to the country's 209 million citizens, repeatedly saying he believes the effects of preventive measures, such as quarantines and lockdowns, could have a worse impact on Brazil's economy. 
During a speech at the Supreme Court on Thursday, Bolsonaro and Finance Minister Paulo Guedes said the economy could suffer a ""total collapse"" if the country doesn't reopen.
""The issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can't let the side-effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,"" Bolsonaro said.
On March 24, Bolsonaro compared the coronavirus to a ""little flu"" in an address to the nation. Less than two months after that comment, there have been more than 132,000 new cases of Covid-19. 
It was followed by a series of controversial statements about the virus by Bolsonaro. ""Brazilians don't catch anything ... they already have the antibodies to keep it from spreading,"" the President has said.
He added again that Brazilians are likely to be immune to the coronavirus during a March 26 press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. ""Brazilians should be studied, we don't catch anything. You see people jumping in sewage, diving in it and nothing happens to them,"" Bolsonaro said.
During the same press conference, Bolsonaro said he believed many Brazilians had already been infected but that those people already had ""the antibodies that would help [coronavirus] not spread.""
The comments were made two weeks after Bolsonaro's press secretary Fabio Wajngarten and other Cabinet members tested positive for coronavirus, after traveling to the US and meeting with President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago.
The World Health Organization said last month there was no evidence that people who have had Covid-19 will not get it a second time.
Bolsonaro says he has been tested twice for coronavirus and both tests came back negative, according to posts on his personal Twitter and Facebook pages. Congressional leaders and a Federal judge are now asking the President to show evidence that the test came back negative, after he recently implied he may have contracted the virus without knowing it.
Social distancing is 'useless,' Bolsonaro claims
Bolsonaro recently reiterated his claims that efforts to flatten the curve of the virus's spread -- via quarantine measures and social distancing -- were ineffective.
""From the looks of it, from what we're going to see now, this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless,"" Bolsonaro said during a Facebook live on April 30th. ""Now, the collateral damage from all of that will be unemployment."" 
Bolsonaro has repeatedly pushed back against quarantine and stay-at-home orders imposed by governors in some of the hardest-hit states, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, during press conferences and via Twitter.
He's also participated in two so-called ""anti-lockdown"" protests outside Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia, where supporters crowded outside the gates and crammed against each other for a chance to see the President.
The latest protest took place last Sunday, May 3. In a live video posted to his personal Facebook account, Bolsonaro appeared without a mask shaking some people's hands and waving at the crowd. Banners calling for military intervention and for the takedown of Congress and Supreme Court have been seen at the protests in the past.
Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria said Bolsonaro's participation in the protests were anti-democratic. 
""President Jair Bolsonaro reveals, once again, his disdain for democracy,"" Doria said in a series of tweets posted to his personal Twitter account Sunday. ""On top of that, he's encouraging the people from his country to disobey health and medicine.""
Bolsonaro and Doria have butted heads over measures to reopen the country, including during a video conference on coronavirus response that included other governors.
""We have to have a president to lead and drive the country, not to divide it,"" Doria said during the March 25 call. Bolsonaro accused Doria of letting his own presidential ambitions ""go to his head"" and said he is an ""example for no one.""
The state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and home to the country's financial capital, has registered the highest number of cases and deaths. At least 39,000 cases and 3,206 deaths have been confirmed in Sao Paulo, according to the latest data from the state's health secretariat. 
The state issued a new mandate Thursday, which makes mandatory the use of face masks in public spaces, including ride-share vehicles. The state government did not specify for how long the measure will remain in place.
The state is scheduled to begin a gradual reopening plan on May 11, according to an announcement made by Doria last month. It's still unclear which businesses will be allowed to resume activities under that plan.
'What do you want me to do?'
Bolsonaro gave a late-night press conference outside the Alvorada presidential palace on April 28, the day when Brazil's death toll surpassed those reported in China.
A reporter asked Bolsonaro about the spike, to which he responded: ""So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?"" He added that even though his middle name is ""Messias,"" which translates as ""Messiah"" in English, he's not ""a miracle worker.""
He later walked back the comments during the same press conference, saying ""I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow.""
Brazilians in several major cities, including the capital Brasilia, protested the comments by banging pots and pans out their windows and yelling ""get out of here"" after the press conference was broadcast.
While Sao Paulo's numbers are the highest, many poorer states in the North and Northeastern part of the country have been heavily affected.
The comments came the same week the country's Supreme Court authorized an investigation into allegations Bolsonaro sought to interfere with police investigations following the resignation of his Justice Minister, Sergio Moro.
A recent survey from pollster Datafolha, showed Bolsonaro's approval at 33% and that the country is split nearly down the middle on whether the President should be impeached."

The 11-year-old has a rare blood disease called chronic cyclic neutropenia, which causes her white cell count to drop dramatically low every three months.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/us/zoom-panel-kidscovid19-maryland/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200425183136-04-alyssa-jennings-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-26T00:10:19Z,"(CNN)Alyssa Jennings knows what it's like to be isolated, sick and self-quarantined. The 11-year-old has a rare blood disease called chronic cyclic neutropenia, which causes her white cell count to drop dramatically low every three months.
This makes her very susceptible to getting severely sick. She is a regular at Inova Fairfax Children's Hospital, where she has an excellent medical team.
In December, Alyssa spent her Christmas holiday in isolation with Influenza A and B as well as pneumonia. Her mom and grandfather set up a small Christmas tree in her room.
""The first time I got my blood drawn, I cried. I try to think about my dog Hope because she makes me happy,"" Alyssa says. ""Usually when I'm scared, I tell myself it will be all right. I color or paint and do puzzles to get my mind off being in the hospital."" 
Alyssa jokes she almost finished a 200-piece ""Frozen"" puzzle but is still looking for the one missing piece in her room. 
One hospital visit was particularly rough on her mom, Danielle Jennings.
""Once her [Aly's] heart stopped briefly. And it terrified me. We had to check for impacts of oxygen because of it. Those nights I am usually crying and frustrated and have to take a walk and chat with another parent. But Aly took it all in stride.""
Alyssa is in the highest risk group for the coronavirus because of her extremely compromised immune system. Her temperature is checked three times a day, and her doctors call in at least a couple of times a week.
But during the coronavirus pandemic, Alyssa's mind isn't just on herself. She's come up with a novel way using the internet to help her peers cope with their own experiences.
A constant battle against germs
Alyssa lives with Jennings, a government military analyst who is now working from home. She is a sixth-grade honor student in Prince George's County, Maryland. 
Before the arrival of the coronavirus, Alyssa's life looked a lot like everyone else's today. When she arrived home from school, she dropped her backpack, clothes, shoes, keys and all belongings at the front door to be disinfected each night.
Phones, remote controls and door handles were wiped down constantly. 
Alyssa always carries a mask, gloves, hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes in a little purse just in case she's confronted with a cough, sneeze or dirty area.
""Once her heart stopped briefly. And it terrified me. We had to check for impacts of oxygen because of it. Those nights I am usually crying and frustrated and have to take a walk and chat with another parent. But Aly took it all in stride.""
Alyssa often tried to explain to her classmates why she had to take so many precautions, but they often didn't understand.
'They think I'm joking about it'
""They don't really care. They think I'm joking about it,"" says Alyssa. ""Sometimes they cough on me on purpose. The last time that happened, I had to move to the back of the line. I got in trouble with the teacher because I moved out of the line and had to do lunch detention.""
As much as Alyssa's mother tries to arm her daughter with encouragement, Jennings says ""most kids think she's making it up or being 'a little extra,' as they say.""
Now Alyssa's classmates are for the first time experiencing what she has lived with since she can remember the fears around getting sick, confronting the unknown and all the necessary life restrictions to stay healthy.
""I'm beginning to feel they know it's not a game. It's a big deal,"" says Alyssa.
Alyssa wants to talk to other kids about the coronavirus to let them know that many of the things they are unfamiliar with are not cause to panic.
""I feel like some kids are scared. The news scares them, and they become terrified."" Alyssa worries.
So with the help of her mother and adult mentor Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Alyssa's vision was launched Friday through a Zoom panel called ""KidsCovid19.""
Five kids, ranging from 10 to 16, registered with their parents' permission for the Zoom discussion that was broadcast live on Facebook.
""It's important for kids to 'walk it out' as I say, for them to feel they have a voice. Sometimes we are so busy adulting we don't have time to hear what they're saying. And the news is constantly talking about the struggles of adults, the frustration around homeschooling, not what the kids are going through,"" Jennings says.
The children's stories run the gamut. 
A young girl lights up when she describes the fun she's having with her dad doing something completely new -- putting together 400-piece puzzles. Her brothers' wrestling doesn't really bother her the way it used to.
A boy laments ""it's a big bummer"" after waiting eight months to play on the school's soccer team but concedes he likes to kick the ball around with his father after he completes his schoolwork.
Another boy says ""I'm kind-of sad because Covid is stopping everything,"" especially the letters he's sending to his pen pals that are now getting delayed in transit.
An older boy tells the story about how his dad no longer works at a barbershop but at Amazon instead, and how he's fighting boredom in his house from ""seeing the same people all the time.""
Another girl has become fascinated with her parents' record player and album set she recently discovered.
Several children volunteer that they feel ""really nervous"" and ""scared"" from watching news about the coronavirus on TV.
The discussion also addresses fears around losing those closest to them, including their parents and grandparents.
'She wants to inspire hope'
Alyssa and her mother are African-American. They are both aware of the disproportionately high mortality rate of those in the black community who are infected with the coronavirus. 
Jennings says this fact makes it even more important for Alyssa and her friends, particularly those of color, to have an outlet to talk about their lives and fears around the pandemic.
""The fact that this is virtual has given Alyssa more courage to speak up about her own experience,"" Jennings says. ""She wants to inspire hope.""
""If I know I can get better each time and I can come out of the hospital, they can think that, too. They can come out and spend time with their family again,"" Alyssa says.
Alyssa was encouraged to hear several children on the KidsCovid19 chat bring up the fact that some kids have weakened immune systems so everyone should be more careful.
""I felt a bit proud,"" Alyssa says, ""because it made me feel like I wasn't alone. I wasn't the only kid chosen for this ... they know it's a real thing. It's a big deal.""
Expanding the conversation
In the weeks ahead, with adult supervision, Alyssa is hoping to expand her KidsCovid19 chat group to keep the conversations going.
In the meantime, she is super busy doing schoolwork and managing a coronavirus supply group on Facebook, which started as a social studies project and has since morphed into a volunteer organization.
In the days ahead, Alyssa has two big events unfolding: her next blood test at Inova Fairfax Children's Hospital and her birthday on May 23.
Depending on her white blood cell count, Alyssa will either be escorted directly to the hospital's isolation unit where she will face another quarantine until her immune system strengthens or be allowed to return home to celebrate her birthday.

His doctors urged him to call his family for what could be hi…",https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/19/health/coronavirus-recovery-long-journey-wellness/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200519112338-michael-herbert-family-super-tease.jpeg,2020-05-19T21:32:26Z,"(CNN)Michael Herbert, a 49-year-old father of two, was scared he would never see his family again. Herbert says he only had a 20% chance of survival, and needed to be placed in a medically induced coma. His doctors urged him to call his family for what could be his last goodbye. 
It had all started innocuously enough -- a cough and fever. After that, however, his illness took off. Within a week, he was on a breathing machine in the ICU because of a life-threatening lung infection from Covid-19.
His wife Heidi and two daughters painfully remember the next six days when Herbert was unconscious -- wondering if and how they could be at his bedside during a strict no-visitor hospital policy, just to hold his hand in what might be his last days. 
Herbert's rapid worsening was even jarring for his medical team caring for him. ""It was certainly unusual how quickly he went from a period of apparent stability to requiring ventilatory support,"" said Dr. Neal Greenfield, a critical care physician who helped care for Michael at Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Illinois.
But as quickly as Herbert got worse, he then recovered. His doctors reduced his sedation, and with his regained consciousness, Herbert video-called his family every day. Unable to speak with a breathing tube, he would sign, ""I love you.""
He was taken off of his ventilator on his mother's birthday -- a week earlier than expected -- and he gave his mom the best birthday gift a son could give. 
""I was able to call her and just say, ""Hi,"" and then I was able to FaceTime my girls and wife, which was wonderful,"" he said.
 Herbert was released from the hospital a few days later. His cough and fever improved. On paper, he would be listed as recovered, but as we are learning, the aftermath of Covid-19 is not nearly as straightforward as once believed.
Tracking for a disease with little information
""Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind. We were dealing with the crisis,"" said Dr. Reynold Panettieri, vice chancellor of clinical and translational science and a pulmonary critical care physician at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
While most patients with Covid-19 will fully recover, data from China suggest that some patients, especially those who had more severe infections, may face lasting -- even permanent -- damage to their bodies.
To better understand these effects, Panettieri is leading a six-month study of recovered Covid-19 patients. So far, his research group has enrolled more than 800 participants.
""Now, we'll start to see what the long-term consequences are,"" Panettieri said. ""And that is an issue that will really need to be addressed.""
Unlike most viral diseases, which may result in a nagging cough for weeks, Panettieri has observed that some patients recovering from Covid-19 have other serious symptoms that won't go away. 
""They had an illness for about two weeks, and three months later, they're still not feeling 'quite right,'"" he said. ""They were aggressive athletes or were exercising and...they still haven't gotten back to that prowess that they were pre-illness.""
He said this could be related to a number of factors, including how the virus affects the lungs, heart and muscles.
For Michael Herbert, his doctors believe his lingering cough and shortness of breath are likely remnants of his serious bout of pneumonia. Despite leaving the hospital a month ago, Herbert still struggles to recover back to how he felt before getting sick.
Dangerous lung scarring reminiscent of SARS and MERS
While a longer recovery course might be expected for someone such as Herbert who faced a more severe illness, there's also concern for more permanent lung damage, according to Dr. Ronald DePinho, professor and past president of MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-founder of Tvardi Therapeutics. DePinho is particularly worried that the immune response to Covid-19 may cause irreversible scarring known as pulmonary fibrosis. 
Pulmonary fibrosis can be a ""relentlessly progressive"" disease of the lungs in which patients can become dependent on oxygen or even ultimately require lung transplants, he said. Again, this is after a patient is thought to have ""recovered.""
Though it's too early to know whether patients with the novel coronavirus will develop this sort of lung scarring, studies in other related coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, suggests certain Covid-19 patients may have lasting fibrosis. One study following 36 MERS patients found a third still had lung fibrosis on chest x-rays after a median follow-up of 43 days.
And up to two-thirds of patients with SARS who were sick enough to require hospitalization also developed pulmonary fibrosis, according to DePinho. If the same pattern holds true for Covid-19, that could mean many thousands of people will have long-term lung scarring, he said.
The data from China thus far is still thin, but the early results follow the same pattern DePinho is describing. In a study of 63 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan, China, about 18% had ""fibrous stripes"" on CT scans. And in another study, it took more than 6 weeks for one patient's chest CT to return to normal, even though his symptoms had already improved.
This might explain why some patients have significant drops in their lung function even after recovering from the novel coronavirus. Losses in lung function could be as high as 20 to 30 percent, the medical director of infectious diseases at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong told a media briefing in March.
More on Covid-19 and the lungs
There is another factor that may be driving long-term issues with the lungs, unrelated to scarring or fibrosis. We are learning those with Covid-19 also can form blood clots at an abnormally high rate. In rare situations, a clot that has formed in the deep veins of the legs may travel to the lungs -- known as a pulmonary embolism. This is what happened to Warnell Vega, a healthy 33-year-old I interviewed with Covid-19 who survived a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and is now home in recovery.
As is often the case, Vega developed a pulmonary embolism with little or no warning. He only had a mild cough when he passed out in his bathroom. He woke up in an ICU at Mount Sinai hospital. He was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19, after which a scan revealed a pulmonary embolism. His doctors told me that Vega became critically ill and developed signs of pulmonary hypertension, which happens 2-4% of the time in patients with a PE (pulmonary embolism). So far Vega told me he feels close to normal, but recent clinical studies have shown that close to half of patients who suffered a pulmonary embolism will still experience exercise limitations at one year.
Given his history of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism, Vega is at risk of developing a blood clot again, and may need to be on blood thinners for some time as he continues to recover. 
Blood thinners in general might improve outcomes for hospitalized patients with Covid-19, according to a report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The team at Mount Sinai conducting the study found 29% of patients on ventilators who were provided blood thinners died, compared to 63% of patients on ventilators who were not given blood thinners. The improvement in mortality rates with blood thinners might demonstrate how dangerous blood clots from Covid-19 are. 
Another significant risk factor for a successful recovery is the impact of this virus on the heart. The virus' impact on the lungs may eventually lead to less oxygenated blood reaching the heart. Ot the virus may attack the heart itself, leading to myocarditis -- inflammation of the heart muscle. Both can lead to chronic heart damage, even in the previously healthy.
""There have been a number of reported cardiac complications associated with the Covid virus and they're so varied,"" said Dr. Joseph Brennan, the director of the coronary intensive care unit at Yale University School of Medicine.
He said there are a couple ways to look at how Covid-19 could cause long-term effects on the heart. One way is the direct impact of the virus on the heart, and the other is how clotting from Covid could lead to heart attacks. 
""We are all aware that heart attacks may have long-term consequences because of a potential and permanent decline in heart function,"" he said. ""Those that have had...heart attacks associated with the Covid virus will more than likely have long-term consequences.""
A study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology found 19.7% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients suffered from some type of cardiac injury. Such patients might not be able to exercise as much, feel breathless or feel like their heart is beating faster than usual for an indefinite period of time. In general, a faster heart rate will likely be a common side effect in the long run for Covid-19 patients, especially if patients have underlying lung issues from Covid-19, he said.
Though Michael Herbert did not have heart-related complications from Covid-19, he did suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity -- conditions that affect heart health and put him at risk for a more severe infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Another important organ at risk for damage from blood clots? The brain. Large clots would more likely cause obvious symptoms, but smaller ones may lead to a type of dementia known as vascular dementia. Both can cause permanent damage that might not present itself until years down the line.
""We know that if someone has a stroke, it approximately doubles their risk of getting dementia later in life,"" said Dr. Marion Buckwalter, associate professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Stanford University. ""[Our research group] discovered that people who had a more vigorous immune response by day two after stroke were more likely to have cognitive decline in the first year after stroke."" 
Michael Herbert feels lucky that he hasn't experienced these types of symptoms during his recovery, especially given how severe his infection was. 
""I'm feeling good,"" Michael said. ""My strength has come back. It's not perfect, but I feel better.""
 Though his progress has been incremental, he remains encouraged that each day has been a step in the right direction. He remembers how weak he felt trying to move from his ICU bed to a wheelchair. Now, he is working towards walking two miles a day without stopping.
The entire ordeal has been a huge wake up call for him -- he now takes his health much more seriously, and he is grateful that his doctors have provided him a second chance.
""I mean, I have bonus time here in life,"" he said. ""I was supposed to be dead, and I didn't die. I'm not going to waste any days I have left."""

The Springfield-Greene Health Department announced Saturday that a second hairstylist tested positive for coronavirus, and may have exposed 56 clients at the same Great Clips salon. 
A day earlier, it had said another hairstylist with coronavirus at the same salon potentially exposed 84 customers and seven coworkers. 
Both stylists had symptoms while at work, officials said. They did not provide details on the symptoms they had or when they tested positive. 
The case highlights the dangers of community spread in the United States as businesses reopen after weeks of restrictions to combat the spread of coronavirus. 
The stylists and clients wore face coverings
Both stylists worked from the second week of May to Wednesday. The clients and the stylists all wore face coverings, the Health Department said. At the time, businesses like barbershops and hair salons were allowed to operate in the state. 
 ""It is the hope of the department that because face coverings were worn throughout this exposure timeline, no additional cases will result,"" it added.
The salon kept impeccable records that made contact tracing possible, said Clay Goddard, director of the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.
But he cautioned about the risks of overwhelming resources. 
""I'm going to be honest with you: We can't have many more of these,"" he said at a news conference. ""We can't make this a regular habit or our capabilities as a community will be strained.""
Goddard said he was pleased with the deep cleaning measures taken by Great Clips, adding that he now considers the business safe. 
""The well-being of Great Clips customers and stylists in the salon is our top priority and proper sanitization has always been an important cosmetology industry practice for Great Clips salons. We've closed the salon where the employee works and it's currently undergoing additional sanitizing and deep cleaning,"" the owners of the business said in a statement to CNN affiliate KYTV.

So how did it become one of the hardest hit?
As of Monday, Peru had more than 119,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 3,400 deaths -- putting it second only to Brazil both in number of cases and deaths in Latin America. 
The two countries had handled the epidemic entirely differently: While Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed the dangers posed by the coronavirus, Peru's President Martin Vizcarra declared on March 15 a nationwide state of emergency that included mandatory self-quarantine, and shuttered the country's borders. 
But the virus surged all the same. 
More than 85% of Peru's ICU beds with ventilators are currently occupied, according to government figures, and overcrowding at hospitals is feared. 
""This situation is not just a health emergency, but a health catastrophe, defined as a situation where the pandemic has overtaken the response capacity of the health sector,"" Dr. Alfredo Celis of the Medical College of Peru told CNN en Español.
How did a country that responded assertively and seriously to the pandemic end up like this? 
Needs vs. quarantine measures 
The deep inequality in Peru is one reason, according to Dr. Elmer Huerta, a Peruvian doctor and contributor to CNN en Español. ""What I have learned is that this virus lays bare the socio-economic conditions of a place,"" he said. 
Many of Peru's poor have no choice but to venture outside their homes for work, food or even banking transactions. 
For example, only 49% of Peruvian households own a refrigerator or freezer (61% in urban areas), according to the country's 2017 Census. This translates to a need for many to visit markets daily for food because they can't stock up, Huerta said. 
""You're supposed to avoid human contact in a society where one can't stay at home,"" Huerta said. 
On April 14 -- about a month after Peru enacted its mandatory stay-at-home policy and implemented a curfew -- CNN affiliate TV Peru showed images outside of a market on the outskirts of Lima. Shoppers waited in line for hours and a large mass of people milled about. Most wore masks, but social distancing seemed impossible. 
""We must endure (the crowds) because there is no other way,"" one woman standing in line told TV Peru. ""If not, we will not have food. We have nothing to eat, that's why we have come here."" 
On that day, the tally of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country was 10,303. Today, it is 10 times higher. 
People have also ended up crowding at banks as they attempted to access coronavirus relief funds.
The government's stimulus package to help millions of Peru's most vulnerable families was a good idea, but its distribution was poorly designed, said Kristian Lopez Vargas, a Peruvian economist and assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
In a report last year, the agency that regulates Peru's banks reported that only about 38% of adults have a bank account. The lack of access to the financial system means a majority of aid recipients have to go in person to the banks to obtain their money. 
""It was not hard to anticipate people's behavior in their attempt to access this aid,"" Lopez Vargas told CNN. ""Instead, these policies caused unnecessary harm by inducing people to gather in large crowds in banks.""
Many Peruvians also live and work in ways that simply can't be reconciled with social distancing, he pointed out. According to Lopez Vargas, more than 30% of households in Peru live in overcrowded conditions, with four or more people sleeping in the same room.
And more than 72% work in the informal economy, according to Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information. For those living day-to-day in the informal sector, earning an income oftentimes depends on going out to work and not self-isolating. 
This, combined with the needs of millions to obtain food and other items from crowded markets, ""was an explosive mix,"" Lopez Vargas said. 
On Friday, President Vizcarra extended the state of emergency until June 30, keeping in place the mandatory self-quarantine and curfews across the country. It was the fifth time the emergency measures have been extended. But this time, the extension was paired with authorization for certain businesses to re-open, including services like salons, food delivery and dentistry. 
Peru's priorities for enforcing health guidelines also appear to have evolved since the state of emergency was first declared. In early April, Vizcarra reported that during the first weeks of the stay-at-home mandate, as many as 3,000 people were detained for disobeying the measures on some days. On Monday, he announced that the priority is now on enforcing health protocols at the country's markets. 
One lesson learned from the pandemic response is that people must change certain ""social behaviors that have done much damage,"" he added.
""This kind of behavior is individualistic, selfish...ignoring what's happening around us, and precisely what has brought this situation upon us, not just in Peru, but the whole world,"" said Vizcarra. 
But Huerta, the doctor, and Lopez Vargas, the economist, caution against placing too much blame on the people. The underlying problems that the pandemic has laid bare are not new. 
""While it may seem like a mystery to some, it's not,"" Lopez Vargas said.

In a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, Fauci noted that children tend to have milder symptoms or even no symptoms when they are infected with Covid-19. 
What's not yet clear is whether children get infected as frequently as adults, and whether they often pass the infection on to others. Ultimately, he said, the decision to reopen schools needs to be predicated on the level of infection in each community.
In the past academic school year, 48 states recommended schools close through the rest of the year as coronavirus began its rapid spread. 
Some, including schools in Montana and Idaho, opened their doors again for a few weeks before the academic school year finished with the thought of gaining experience in reopening that could be used in the fall.
""I hesitate to make any broad statements about whether it is or is not quote 'safe' for kids to come back to school,"" Fauci told CNN. 
""When you talk about children going back to school and their safety, it really depends on the level of viral activity, and the particular area that you're talking about. What happens all too often, understandably, but sometimes misleadingly, is that we talk about the country as a whole in a unidimensional way."" 
Fauci seemed to think that keeping schools closed in general was not necessary.
""Children can get infected, so, yes, so you've got to be careful,"" Fauci said. ""You got to be careful for them and you got to be careful that they may not spread it. Now, to make an extrapolation that you shouldn't open schools, I think is a bit of a reach.""
Fauci said it's not premature to start the conversation about reopening schools now. ""I think we need to discuss the pros and the cons of bringing kids back to school in September,"" he said.
Stressing the importance of not generalizing, Fauci laid out the spectrum of scenarios for what a return to school in the fall could look like.
""In some situations there will be no problem for children to go back to school,"" he said. ""In others, you may need to do some modifications. You know, modifications could be breaking up the class so you don't have a crowded classroom, maybe half in the morning, half in the afternoon, having children doing alternate schedules. There's a whole bunch of things that one can do.""
Talking about classroom layouts specifically, Fauci underscored the need to ""be creative"" and create plans based on the degree of infection in the community. 
He suggested that one option is to space out children at every other desk, or every third desk in order to maintain proper social distancing.
Study underway on how Covid-19 affects children
Fauci said the same type of creativity would need to be applied to how students get to and from school.
While the conversation about how schools can safely reopen continues, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, launched a study last month to examine further how Covid-19 affects children. 
The study will follow 6,000 people, both children and their families, chosen from 11 cities over the course of six months, to get further clarification on whether children are less likely to catch coronavirus than adults.
""We don't know that for absolutely certain right now,"" Fauci said.
Fauci said his team will likely not see results from the study until December."

Trump's deference to local authorities has not extended far beyond Covid-related decisions. On issues Trump and his allies believe will underscore the suburb-friendly messages that have characterized his most recent political messaging -- from cracking down on demonstrations to forcing schools to reopen -- the White House has pushed a level of federal intervention that has yet to materialize in its coronavirus response.
""I want people to have a certain freedom,"" Trump said on ""Fox News Sunday"" over the past weekend as he explained his refusal to issue a nationwide order that people wear masks in public. ""But I leave it up to the governors.""
Three days later, Trump was standing in the East Room announcing a ""surge"" of federal law enforcement officers to cities and states that did not want the help -- underscoring the contradictory ways he has wielded his power during the deepest crisis of his presidency.
The move was an expansion of Operation Legend, a Department of Justice initiative created to draft officers from federal agencies like the FBI, US Marshals Service and Drug Enforcement Administration in the fight against violent crime.
And on Thursday, Trump was hinting he could ""do something much stronger than being invited in"" if local officials tried to stop the federal agents from operating in their cities. In an interview with Fox News, Trump even suggested he could dispatch as many as 75,000 federal agents.
Some Trump allies had been pushing the White House to take more concrete action to fortify Trump's ""law and order"" message, which they believe will play well with the suburban voters who have been fleeing Trump's camp since 2016.
A campaign adviser said aides and allies to Trump see a political upside in sending in federal forces into Democratic-led cities to quell unruly protests and combat violent crime. On the volatile situation in Oregon, for example, the Trump adviser predicted voters will increasingly point fingers at the governor and mayor of Portland. 
""People blame the mayor and governor and (former Vice President Joe) Biden's inability to stand up to his supporters doing this,"" the adviser said. 
""Trump is seeing this,"" the adviser continued, adding the President is using the opportunity ""to talk about law and order.""
But not all Republicans agree that Trump's push to override the wishes of state and local leaders will help him make inroads with swing voters he needs to win over: college-educated suburban voters who swung to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms.
The crime crackdown is ""great for the 40% (of voters) they already have,"" said Liam Donovan, a Republican consultant and strategist. ""Making that your closing argument when everything is upside down and the campaign is coming apart at the seams means you've lost the plot.""
Leading from behind on Covid
Trump's top-down approach to unrest stands in stark contrast to the unusual deference he has given local authorities during the pandemic, when pressure on him to issue national decrees that could help contain the virus has been high.
As infections first swept the country in March and April, Trump resisted calls to impose a stay-at-home order at the federal level, insisting state and local officials should make the call whether to order their residents to shelter in place.
But by mid-May, Trump was encouraging across-the-board reopenings and had already called on specific states -- including Democratic-led Virginia, Minnesota and Michigan -- to ""liberate"" people by lifting restrictions.
Trump's efforts to encourage mask-wearing have been similarly hands-off. He has himself worn a mask in public on only one occasion, and has repeatedly deferred to local officials to make decisions about whether face coverings are mandatory. Although he floated a potential mask-wearing order for people in federal buildings, the White House did not announce one within the 24-hour timeline he provided.
An administration official downplayed any contradictions in Trump's use of federal authority in the pandemic and in fighting violent crime. The official argued different states have different needs when it comes to the virus, which is why the President has kept the federal government from imposing orders, but said all federal property needs to be protected.
The administration has used the protection of federal buildings as a legal justification for inviting federal law enforcement into some cities.
The President has spent weeks keeping his focus on issues that have little to do with the virus, although he did bring back his personal, primetime press conferences this week as cases continue to climb. At Friday's daily press briefing, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany started off her appearance by highlighting incidents of violence against police from some protesters -- not an update on the fight against the virus.
Trump's team has reserved the use of federal power for moves they see as political wins. His White House assigned US Marshals to protect national monuments at the height of unrest in the month after the death of George Floyd at the hands of white police officers. 
And the administration has aggressively pushed measures encouraging schools to reopen classrooms in the fall despite surging case counts in states across the country, with Trump even threatening to withhold funding from schools that don't comply -- an authority he does not actually have.
Instead, Trump announced on Thursday that the White House would ask Congress for $105 billion in funding for which only schools that reopen could access directly. In districts where the schools remain shuttered, Trump said the money would go to parents, who could then make decisions about alternative arrangements like private school if they wanted.
The move was an acknowledgment by Trump that infection rates have climbed high enough in some places to require continued school closures. But it also set the stage for districts that can't safely reopen to suffer relative to districts where classrooms have the ability to reopen in the fall.
Trump aides and advisers have characterized the school reopening push as a political win, and one likely to play well with the suburban moms Trump needs to regain. The administration has been scrambling to develop supplemental recommendations that encourage school reopenings within a framework of mitigation efforts.
But no similar incentive involving federal funding has yet been offered to states or cities that comply with other recommendations from the administration, such as mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines."

Larry Hogan predicted Tuesday that in light of ongoing spikes in coronavirus cases, testing shortages and delays could make the pandemic even worse.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/21/politics/covid-testing-shortage-maryland-governor-hogan-cnntv/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200721145227-amanpour-hogan-super-tease.jpg,2020-07-21T21:06:38Z,"(CNN)Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan warned Tuesday that coronavirus testing shortages and delays could make the pandemic even worse.
""We're still having, now with this resurgence here in the United States, massive problems with our testing program, which is still kind of a patchwork of different testing going on in different states around the country,"" Hogan told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
His comments come as multiple states are grappling with surging caseloads and deaths from the virus, and as some states, labs and public health departments are reporting that turnaround times for diagnostic testing have slowed. Health officials have cautioned that the long delays Americans are seeing across the country in getting Covid-19 test results is undercutting their usefulness.
""While we've made some improvements since the beginning,"" Hogan said, adding that ""we've still got a long way to go -- this virus is not behind us.""
""We're still continuing to fall short in many areas,"" he said. ""And this robust testing that we need across the country, we started to improve, and now with the virus spiking up we're running into shortages, waiting 10 days, lines -- it's looking a lot like it did back in March and April."" 
CNN previously reported results can now take an average of four to six days for the general population or in some states like Arizona up to three weeks.
Hogan last week slammed President Donald Trump's early response to the pandemic, calling it ""hopeless"" in an excerpt from his upcoming book published in The Washington Post and elaborating on his own efforts to secure testing kits and prevent the deaths of residents in his state. The governor drew attention early on in the pandemic after acquiring half a million test kits with the help of his wife, Yumi, from her native South Korea as the state faced burgeoning cases in April. 
Hogan on Tuesday said that testing challenges could be exacerbated by the flu season in the fall.
""We're still not up to speed on contact tracing, and we've caught up a little bit on personal protective equipment,"" he said. ""We've made some progress, but I feel that as we head into this fall with the confluence of the flu season, with the spike and rebound of this coronavirus, we could be caught short once again and it could be even a more difficult situation that we're facing in the future.""
Maryland is still working its way through the half a million tests from South Korea, but will likely have to order more, Hogan added.
""We're utilizing them now, still, to help us with our outbreaks and clusters, we're using about 3,000 of them a day,"" he said. ""We have a supply that we're still utilizing that will last us for another couple of months, but we're probably going to have to order more of them to take us through this now big demand that's happening with the fall coming.""

The Northern Irishman is competing in the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in Tennessee this week and will play in the US PGA Championship next week and the US Open in September. 
But, when asked about the possibility of returning to Europe for golf tournaments, McIlroy cast doubt, saying he might avoid traveling to reduce being exposed.
""I honestly don't know if I see myself going back to Europe this year,"" the world No. 2 said. ""I don't know. 
""I don't know if I want to travel, I don't know if I want to be exposed to more things and more people. So I don't know, I have no idea and I'm sort of taking it week by week. 
""I've got my schedule planned up until the US Open, which is obviously a couple weeks after the Tour Championship, and then I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do after that.""
Fellow professional's Lee Westwood and Eddie Pepperell decided not to travel to San Francisco for the PGA Championship next week, with Westwood saying he still doesn't ""feel comfortable."" And McIlroy was in full support of their decisions. 
""I understand their plight,"" McIlroy said. ""I was just saying I don't know if I would travel in the fall and go and play some of these other events in Europe, but if it was a major championship, it would probably be different and I probably would go over and play it.
""But that's not to say what Lee and Eddie are doing isn't right, that they feel safer and they feel that their time is better spent at home and not exposing themselves to more people and not having the chance of getting sick or getting someone else sick.
""So I completely understand where they're coming from, but if it was an Open Championship and I had the chance to go over and play, I would probably take the risk and go and play.""
Following on the announcement that August's US PGA Championship will be held without fans, the US Open is following suit. 
In partnership with the state of New York, the United States Golf Association (USGA) announced in a press release Wednesday that the 120th championship, which is scheduled September 17-20 at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York, will take place without spectators.
""Following months of consultation and scenario planning with local and state health officials, we have jointly decided that hosting the U.S. Open without spectators will provide the best opportunity to conduct the championship safely for all involved,"" said Mike Davis, CEO of the USGA. 
""We will miss the excitement of the fans and what their presence brings to the championship. We look forward to welcoming them again to future U.S. Opens.""
The tournament had originally been scheduled for June 18-21 but was postponed in April. 
""I am pleased to welcome the USGA for the U.S. Open Championship at Winged Foot Golf Club this September,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. 
""And while the tournament will look different this year with no fans and enhanced safety protocols, this event is a welcome sight for sports fans across the country and will help restore a sense of normalcy as we build back better than before.""
As the LPGA Tour resumes competitive action with the Drive On Championship at Inverness Golf Course in Toledo, Ohio, one player, Gaby Lopez, has been forced to withdraw following a positive Covid-19 test. 
The 26-year-old announced that following the tour's Covid-19 testing process, she had tested positive and is now beginning her 10-day isolation. Lopez is the first LPGA player to test positive for Covid-19. 
She told fans on Twitter that she is ""feeling good and have only very mild symptoms.""
""I was very excited to get back to playing on Tour after this long break and while I'm disappointed that I'll have to wait a little longer, I am glad that I was able to get tested and to make sure I do not put anyone else at risk,"" Lopez, who is from Mexico, said in a statement.
""I am self-isolating and will be following all the CDC and LPGA guidelines to get back to competing on Tour in a safe manner. I'm feeling good and looking forward to when I can return to playing on Tour.""

So far, more than 5.5 million Americans have been infected and at least 174,255 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country's seven-day average for daily deaths has topped 1,000 for at least 24 days in a row. 
Mitigation measures like controlling crowds and shutting down bars work, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday, but it takes time until they're reflected in the numbers. 
""It is important to understand these interventions are going to have a lag, that lag is going to be three to four weeks,"" Redfield said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association. ""Hopefully this week and next week you're going to start seeing the death rate really start to drop.""
The daily average of new cases in the US has been on the decline for weeks. Redfield's message comes as one Trump administration official said Covid-19 case trends are now ""going in the right direction.""
But Redfield warned that while officials have observed cases fall across red zones in the country, cases in yellow zones across the heart of the US aren't falling. 
""Middle America right now is getting stuck,"" he said. ""That is why it's so important for Middle America to recognize the mitigation that we talked about ... it's for Middle America too, the Nebraskas, the Oklahomas.""
""We don't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now,"" he said. ""We need to prevent that.""
Superspeading events help drive pandemic
In rural areas, superspreading events have been especially important in helping drive the pandemic, researchers in Georgia said this week. 
Superspreading events like parties, conferences and large gatherings have been cautioned against by leaders throughout the country. Earlier this month, experts raised concern about a motorcycle rally in a small South Dakota town which was expected to bring tens of thousands of visitors. 
Biostatistician Max Lau of Emory University and a team analyzed Georgia health department data in more than 9,500 Covid-19 cases in four metro Atlanta-area counties and Dougherty County in rural southwestern Georgia between March and May.
""Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections,"" they wrote in their report. 
Younger people were more likely to spread the virus than people over 60, the Georgia study showed.
In Ohio, the governor said that while the state has seen a significant decrease in cases across urban areas, infections have increased in rural areas. 
""Spread is primarily, we're seeing in social situations, family gatherings where people are unmasked, and in close contact and basically let their guard down,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday.
Up to 60 million Americans likely infected 
Experts have for long said the true number of infections throughout the country is likely many times higher than the cases reported. 
On Thursday, Redfield said as many as 60 million Americans could have contracted the virus -- more than 10 times the number of cases recorded. 
""I think if you're going to do a crude estimate, somewhere between 30 and 60 million people -- but let's let the data come out and see what the data shows,"" he said. 
There are many reasons behind why the number of true infections remain uncertain.
Many cases were missed early on in the pandemic due to a lack of testing capacity. And many Americans who never got tested in the first place could recover from the virus without ever knowing they had it. Last month, the CDC estimated about 40% of people infected with the virus don't show symptoms. 
White House declares teachers essential workers 
Meanwhile, amid a turbulent back-to-school season the White House made a new push for a return to education normalcy. 
Teachers were declared essential workers in what is the administration's latest effort to pressure school districts to bring students back this fall. 
Under Department of Homeland Security guidance issued this week, teachers are now considered ""critical infrastructure workers,"" and are subject to the same kinds of advisories as other workers who have born that label -- such as doctors and law enforcement officers.
Guidance for essential workers state they can continue to work even after exposed to a confirmed case of the virus, as long as they remain asymptomatic. 
Across the US, institutions have been torn between remote instruction or implementing dozens of new measures to prevent virus clusters around in-person learning. Many teachers have protested a return to in-person instruction, saying doing so could prove deadly. Some have opted to resign instead of going back to class amid the pandemic. 
In Arizona, three teachers who shared a classroom teaching online during the pandemic all contracted the virus earlier this summer, despite following safety protocols. One of them died less than two weeks after being hospitalized. 
As some schools reopened, more than 2,000 students, teachers and staff members across several states were asked to quarantine following more than 200 positive cases reported. 
And as university campuses now welcome students into dorms, colleges across at least 15 states have reported Covid-19 cases, tracing back to athletics, Greek life or off-campus gatherings.

At least seven Covid-19 cases in Nebraska's Panhandle region have been tied to the rally, Kim Engel, director of the Panhandle Public Health District, confirmed in an email to CNN. 
The department said that contact tracing had been completed, and declined to comment further.
The cases that have appeared in Nebraska are the latest to be connected to the 80th annual Sturgis motorcycle rally, which took place August 7-16.
South Dakota state health officials announced Thursday that a person who worked at a tattoo shop in Sturgis had tested positive for the virus, and could have possibly exposed people during the event last week. 
The person was an employee of Asylum Tattoo Sturgis, and could have spread the virus to others on August 13-17 from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., officials said.
Earlier this week, officials said a person who spent hours at a bar during the rally had also tested positive. That individual visited One-Eyed Jack's Saloon in Sturgis on August 11 from noon to 5:30 p.m. while able to transmit the virus to others, health officials said. 
Anyone who visited either the tattoo shop or the saloon, which are located at the same address, during that period should monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the visit.
Rally had raised concerns
Health experts were concerned that this year's Sturgis motorcycle rally could be a ""super spreader"" event. The 10-day mass gathering typically draws crowds of more than 500,000 people from all over the country, including coronavirus hotspots.
South Dakota Department of Transportation officials tracked more than 462,000 vehicles entering Sturgis during the rally. Though the total was a 7.5% decline from the previous year, it is still one of the largest mass gatherings since the start of the pandemic.
Many of the attendees did not comply with health guidelines such as wearing masks and keeping distance from others, as seen at a concert for the rock band Smash Mouth.
A little more than 60% of people in Sturgis voted against holding the motorcyle event. But city officials said they felt they wouldn't have been able to stop the crowds from coming in and instead opted to prepare for the event as best they could.
""There are people throughout America who have been locked up for months and months,"" Daniel Ainslie, the city manager, told CNN last week. ""So we kept hearing from people saying it doesn't matter, they are coming to Sturgis. So with that, ultimately the council decided that it was really vital for the community to be prepared for the additional people that we're going to end up having.""
South Dakota reported 193 new cases on Friday. It's one of several US states that have seen an increase in new cases this past week compared to the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Young people -- whoUS officials say helped drive a nationwide surge of new coronavirus cases over the summer -- are now returning to college campuses across the country. With them have come reports of hundreds of infections. Despite efforts to keep the virus at bay, outbreaks have been traced to off-campus gatherings, sororities and fraternities, and dorms, leaving schools to reassess how to proceed with the fall semester.
At Appalachian State University, a cluster was associated with the football team. Iowa State University said 175 students tested positive for the virus -- about 2.2% of those tested -- during move-in.
""It's just extremely difficult to consider yourself to be in a bubble when there is a very high level of community spread around you or when people are coming from all over the country and congregating on college campuses,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore City Health Commissioner. ""You can't keep coronavirus out.""
Across the US, the spread of the virus is still very much not under control. The country has reported more than 1,000 new deaths in a day at least 12 times this month. In Florida, officials reported deaths of more than 200 people in a day -- for at least the 10th time in the past month. More than 5.4 million Americans have been infected since the start of the pandemic and at least 171,821 have died. 
While older Americans and those with underlying conditions are at greater risk of severe illness, health officials have emphasized it's not only those populations that should be cautious.
Coronavirus cases in children steadily increased from March to July, experts said earlier this month and one in three children who were hospitalized were admitted to intensive care -- the same as adults. 
And younger people who may recover from the virus with minimal symptoms and in many cases don't require hospitalization, still can have ""residual symptoms for weeks and sometimes month,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
""We'd better be careful when we say 'Young people who don't wind up in the hospital are fine, let them get infected, it's OK.' No, it's not OK,"" Fauci said during an American Society for Microbiology briefing on Monday. 
14 students asked to leave Drake University campus
Some university leaders made it clear from early on that there will be zero tolerance when it comes to violating safety guidelines. 
Fourteen Drake University students were asked to leave the campus for two weeks after violating an agreement signed by students that outlined health and safety protocols for the year. 
Several of the students ""are now facing repercussions through the Code of Student Conduct,"" said a letter from the Dean of Students Jerry Parker.
""This message is not intended to call out the students involved -- it is a reminder that we must hold each other accountability,"" Parker wrote.
The letter echoes the sentiment ofanother university president, who sent a sternwarning to students who don't follow safety guidelines.
""Let me be perfectly clear, if we don't do these things, YOU WILL BE SENT HOME and more importantly, our community members' health will be at risk,"" Villanova University President Peter M. Donohue wrote last week.
Universities change class plans 
Rising cases have led some colleges to scrap plans for in-person learning to start the school year. 
All undergraduate classes at the University of Notre Dame will be remote for the next two weeks as the university tries to get a recent spike in coronavirus cases under control, the president announced this week. Michigan State University classes will begin remotely for all undergraduates, President Samuel L. Stanley announced. 
UNC - Chapel Hill is also moving to remote learning for undergraduates starting Wednesday, Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz and Vice Chancellor Robert Brown said in a letter about a week after classes started.
""In just the past week (Aug. 10-16), we have seen COVID-19 positivity rate rise from 2.8% to 13.6% at Campus Health. As of this morning, we have tested 954 students and have 177 in isolation and 349 in quarantine, both on and off campus,"" the letter said.
The school said it still plans to play sports this fall, despite no longer holding in-person classes. The University of Alabama announced spectators will be allowed at home football games, saying this week it prohibits tailgating on campus but will allow fans to fill up about 20% of the Bryant-Denny Stadium. That venue usually holds about 20,000 fans. 
Ithaca College, in New York, which previously pushed back its fall in-person semester to October, announced this week it was shifting to remote instruction for the entire semester.
""I sincerely believe this is the correct and responsible choice for Ithaca College to help protect the health and safety of our students, their families, our faculty and staff, and our Ithaca-area communities,"" President Shirley M. Collado wrote in a letter to the community.
Saliva test could be in use within weeks 
Meanwhile, SalivaDirect, the test that got the green light from the FDA last week, could be in use by approved labs within the next few weeks, says Anne Wyllie, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health who was part of the team responsible for the protocol.
""It's been actually very inspiring to see how many labs have already reached out to us -- how many are ready and willing to get going with SalivaDirect,"" Wyllie told CNN.
This is great news for many Americans who still have to wait several days to receive their results -- a waiting period that some health officials have called counterproductive to the country's efforts to get the virus under control. 
The test doesn't require specialized supplies and can deliver results in less than three hours. Officials have called the test a ""game changer"" and one expert has also pointed to its expected low cost.
""We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,"" saidNathan Grubaugh, a Yale assistant professor of epidemiology.

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)To one of the many members of the Miami Marlins who has tested positive for Covid-19, it likely feels like a century since Rudy Gobert -- the first player in the NBA to test positive for Covid-19 in March -- said he was sorry for downplaying the risks of the disease. But here we are: the Atlanta Braves faced the Marlins in exhibition play just last week, the Baltimore Orioles don't have anyone to play now, the Yankees v. Phillies game is postponed, and questions remain as to why the Marlins played on Sunday after news broke that four players tested positive, including, apparently, Jose Urena, scratched from his scheduled start.
Games can only go on until they can't anymore, something that Florida's schools, which are on schedule to reopen in August, might take to heart -- especially as the Marlins await their latest round of test results in hotel rooms in Pennsylvania. Theirs is a luxury students and teachers, no doubt, won't have available to them throughout the upcoming school year. 
Instead of serving as a reward for getting our response to a global pandemic right -- by installing the necessary measures of social distancing and masks, masks that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could bring this thing to a manageable level within weeks -- baseball is now a microcosm of how to best battle our imploding failures, a grand experiment for our other institutions, perhaps especially the public schools that the man in the White House is so eager to reopen so America can get ""back to work."" Just as sport, particularly the NBA, became the key signal for America to shut it all down in March, it now has to show the way back.
We first talked about the return to sport and school, to gyms and movie theaters, in late April, as the curve began to flatten in America's hot spots through the hard work of strict mask and social distancing mandates. Even here in New Rochelle, New York, where my daughter's school was amongst the first to close on the East Coast, plans for fall began, counting on a trajectory that made sense according to the data. 
The NBA, one of the first major institutions in the country to shut down, waking many Americans up to the impending disaster, hatched a plan to finally finish out its season, choosing Florida as the location for its veritable bubble. 
The NBA, like most Americans, thought we would be in a different place by now. Well, we are. And because of a feebly coordinated and fundamentally uninformed reaction to a global pandemic throughout the American South and Southwest, one that ignored the devastating lessons engraved by New York in the national consciousness as well as a laundry list of best practices by public health officials and experts, it's worse. 
Yet still we talk about the new school year, about football games and science labs, as if public education is the product of magical thinking and a professional baseball league should be doing the public health legwork that the federal government has seemingly abandoned.
Hindsight can be, quite literally, a killer. We are in uncharted territory, a place where we have to reimagine sport as a societal problem to solve, one that cannot be a distraction from reality because it is steeped in it, right up to its very chin.
Back in April, the Florida the NBA planned upon did not include single day records in cases or deaths. Back in April, baseball was considering Arizona as its landing site. Think on that for a hot minute, and not in terms of weather.
On the one hand, sport should not have come back before anything else could. Playing the game without spectators isn't a solution -- it's an indicator that maybe it shouldn't happen, with lessons learned at the Champions League game between Atalanta and Valencia back in February, launching the outbreak that took out much of Bergamo, Italy. Why would we think that if sport wasn't safe for its spectators, it could be safe for its athletes?
But we are past the point of asking if sport should be back: sport is back, and there is a lot to learn from it. In many ways, baseball feels like the perfect place to try it all out, a game in which physical contact, barring the occasional bench-clearing brawl, center field collision, and dramatic tag out at second, is often the very essence of sportsmanship, whether a high five for a spectacular catch or the gregarious group of jumping joy that greets a home run hitter as he crosses home plate, ensuring that what happens on the field, at least symbolically, stays on the field. 
But Covid-19 isn't much of a good sport, knowing few, if any boundaries, and having no loyalty to one team over another. 
The fact of the matter is that despite the deep resources of America's national pastime, which is funding constant testing and isolation protocols, the Marlins, a team valued at nearly a billion dollars, couldn't keep its roster, a roster that is smaller than my daughter's social studies class, safe past its first three games of this truncated season. 
Surface contagion, according to the CDC, should not be the focus of our preventive practices, something that is guiding school reopening plans that involve plexiglass, alternating days and cafeteria ""grab and go"" bags. But however low that risk might be, it is great enough to keep the Yankees out of the visiting clubhouse at Citizens Bank Ballpark in Philadelphia because the Marlins occupied the space just 24-hours earlier. 
And yet my kid is supposed to sit at that desk? 
Unlike my daughter's school district (of nearly 11,000 students,approximately 730 staff and a school year of 180 days), Major League Baseball wrote a 113-page manual to outline a 60-game season that involved about 8,000 people, with players, unlike the NBA's bubble, living at home and travelling despite the fact that at least 19 teams had positive cases before the new ""spring training"" even started. They did this ignoring that teams from New York and Boston had far different backdrops, places that worked hard through tough mandates to flatten their curves than the likes of the Miami Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks or Houston Astros, whose home fanbases are now dealing with catastrophic levels of the pandemic, something that worried the Canadian government so much, it essentially told the Blue Jays to find a new home until season's end. 
Meanwhile, despite being considered the wealthiest nation on earth, America's schools do not seem to have the infrastructure of a baseball team, and yet it is still the arena that we count on for child care during the workday, for food and social services and, in the months that are soon to come, warmth and light. As the American Academy of Pediatrics, in its statement about why school is about so much more than academics, concludes, ""our nation's response to Covid-19 has laid bare inequities and consequences for children that must be addressed."" 
Covid-19 hasn't created fractures. It has thrown a spotlight on them. Perhaps if we funded our schools like baseball -- if teachers got contracts like Mike Trout or Mookie Betts or, minimally, didn't have to pay for their own school supplies and bulletin boards -- they'd be better prepared to make it work this fall. 
But they aren't. And it turns out that even with all that it has, including an evidence-based approach to reopening that doesn't involve hopes the virus will just one day ""disappear,"" baseball already has problems, ones that we must take seriously if we want to figure this out and find a new normal we all can live with. So let's play ball, because right now, sports might be the only national public health examples we've got."

COVID-19 is a pandemic, the World Health Organization declared in a press briefing Wednesday.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cited not just the leaping numbers of cases, deaths, and countries affected in making the determination but also the slow responses of many countries and governments.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" WHO Director-General, who goes by Dr. Tedros, said.
As of Wednesday, there are over 121,000 cases and over 4,370 deaths in at least 114 countries and territories worldwide.
We expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher, Dr. Tedros said. He urged countries to be prepared.
The declaration doesnt change WHOs response efforts or the recommendations already in place for countries, Dr. Tedros said. And it doesnt mean that containment is a lost cause, he emphasized. It would be a mistake to abandon the containment strategy for countries seeing few or no cases.
Rather, this should be seen as a trigger for more aggressive action and responses, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, added in the briefing. We need to focus on the job at hand, he said, referencing outbreak and emergency responses.
In the past weeks, Drs. Tedros and Ryan have bristled at reporters repeated questions about when or if a pandemic would be declared over the spread of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
There has been so much attention on one word, Dr. Tedros said Wednesday. Its not a word to use lightly. But he gave us some other important terms to focus on: preparedness, public health, political leadership, and people. Were all in this together."

An Amazon worker at a warehouse in Queens, New York, has been infected by the coronavirus, Amazon acknowledged in an email to Ars Technica. ""We are supporting the individual who is now in quarantine,"" a spokesperson wrote.
This appears to be the first Amazon warehouse worker to contract the virus in the United States. Multiple workers have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in Europe.
Amazon says that after learning about the infected worker, the company sent employees home with pay and performed a deep cleaning of the facility. The warehouse has now been re-opened.
""Were following all guidelines from local officials about the operations of our buildings,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees including increased cleaning at all facilities, maintaining social distance, and adding distance between drivers and customers when making deliveries.""
The coronavirus pandemic has only increased the importance of Amazon to the American economy. As customers have grown fearful of catching the virus in brick-and-mortar stores, they've been placing more orders with Amazon. Amazon said this week that it plans to hire an extra 100,000 people to help cope with the surging demand.
However, there's a risk that more Amazon warehouse workers could catch the coronavirus.
Amazon says that it's taking a number of precautions to protect workers. The company says it is maintaining a three-foot separation between workers and has eliminated stand-up meetings during workers' shifts. The company has staggered break times and spread out the chairs in break rooms to minimize contact between employees.
Workers also have unlimited paid sick time through the end of the month, and Amazon says it's requiring workers to stay home if they feel unwell."

While scientists are working to contain the outbreak and come up with effective treatments, health experts say people can still prepare and guard against infection. ABC News spoke with health experts to provide the latest information on how to stay safe as the disease spreads.
1. What are the symptoms?
Novel coronavirus can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe, including cough, fever and shortness of breath. Since the symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, influenza and the common cold, only a diagnostic test can confirm whether an individual has coronavirus.
2. How is it transmitted?
The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.
Person-to-person transmission is mostly likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.
While it's possible the virus could be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.
3. I live in the United States. What should I do?
While there are no clusters of COVID-19 in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans should prepare for transmission of the virus within some communities in the near future, potentially leading to a significant disruption in citizens' daily lives.
The CDC advises making a plan, telling schools and businesses to have systems in place for teleschooling and working remotely if face-to-face interactions must be restricted.
Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.
Call schools and ask if there are plans for teleschooling. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about teleworking options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.
For now, the CDC recommends Americans uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home from work if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.
4. Should I wear a face mask?
Not unless you are the one who is sick.
The CDC doesnt currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.
""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.
While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.
""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

5. Should I be tested for the virus?
It's probably not up to you.
While the CDC is trying to roll out testing capabilities to states, we're not at that point. If you have symptoms, such as a cough or fever, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.
If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. Few people are expected to fall into that category.
6. Should I cancel my upcoming trip to Europe or Asia?
That depends. How risk averse are you?
The U.S. State Department provides travel advisories that include up-to-date recommendations about which countries have reported cases of COVID-19 and how widespread disease transmissions have been. The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check back often and use that information to inform what's essentially a personal decision.
In addition to considering whether the country in question has seen a significant influx of COVID-19 cases, think about the situation on ground. Has travel within the country been disrupted? How would you feel about the potential of being quarantined upon your return to the United States? If it's a work trip, would the situation on the ground make it difficult to be productive?
The answer may be different for different people. Schaffner, for example, noted that Italy is a big country and that he would feel comfortable traveling to Rome, since the epicenter of Italy's COVID-19 outbreak has is clustered in the northern part of the country. His wife, on the other hand, would not.
""She doesn't have that risk tolerance,"" he said.

7. Do quarantines work?
""The short answer is apparently, yes, and better than we thought,"" Schaffner said.
After China imposed strict quarantine and lockdown measures in hard-hit Hubei province, new cases of COVID-19 appeared to decline, Schaffner explained.
It's too soon to know the full effect of that quarantine, which is essentially an unprecedented public health experiment. And imposing strict quarantine measures on an entire community may not be replicable outside of China.
""Try doing that in New York,"" Schaffner added. ""Ain't gonna happen.""
8. Will the outbreak turn into a pandemic?
The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and with clusters of COVID-19 in countries around the world, including extensive transmission in a number of them, we're certainly on the precipice of that reality.
For the United States, more transmissions in more countries raises the possibility that there will be similar local transmission of the virus here.
""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.
""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss. Widespread transmission is making threat of a pandemic more real.
""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""

9. How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?
Concerned enough to pay attention. Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.
Even the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.
""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son earlier in the day that asked whether he should stock up on canned goods.
""I would be included not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""
COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with COVID-19's fatality rate believed to be around 2%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.
""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added.
10. Is there a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19? 
No. There are trials underway in China and elsewhere, but because the virus is new, there's no approved treatment for COVID-19 and a vaccine is likely more than a year away."

But most notable is the gap between what Trump is saying and doing. 
On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted the phrase ""social distancing,"" a measure recommended by the World Health Organization recommends to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aside from staying at home as much as possible, it involves giving yourself at least three feet of distance from others in public. 
You would assume that this tweet means Trump is advising the practice for the American people and would follow it himself. Right?
Wrong.
Hours after typing that tweet with his hopefully well-washed fingers, Trump appeared in the cramped confines of the White House press room (which is even smaller than it looks on TV), closely surrounded by members of his administration and journalists.
Cool cool cool cool cool.
Image: AFP via Getty Images
Trump was in front of the podium for around fifteen minutes, dropping several telling bits of information. One of them being that he was tested for coronavirus himself last night, which comes directly after his doctor said he did not need to be tested. 
Trump said he did not know the test results yet. But don't worry, he reassured those in the room by saying he, like everyone else who had entered, has his temperature taken. (Symptoms of the virus can include fever, but also may not be present in an infected person for many days.) 
But it isn't just the lack of social distancing; it's also the handshaking. When asked about the fact that he was still shaking hands at yesterday's press conference, Trump said it was out of a habit that politicians have.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence revealed further developments on how the administration is handling the spread. Effective midnight Monday, the United States will suspend all travel from the UK and Ireland, adding to the list of countries currently barred from travel. Trump remarked that domestic restrictions could be next, but what that means remains to be seen.
After weeks of relative inaction, the Trump administration has spent the past few days rapidly changing course. Only time will tell what the next move is and, more importantly, whether it will actually be effective in this crisis."

""The demand for our products have skyrocketed this past week, in part due to everyone stocking up on their favorite stay-at-home activities with Coronamania,"" said Emojibator co-founder and CMO Kristin Fretz in an emailed statement. Before people in the U.S. began to self-quarantine, they already felt the coronavirus impact in terms of longer shipment wait times, but they were able to restock without significant delays.

""Exploring your pleasure is really a great way to feel alive during this strange time. More pleasure means better sleep, less stress, and overall improved wellbeing."" 
To keep up with demand, Emojibator will debut limited-edition styles for their toys in the upcoming weeks. Fretz said, ""With the same brand of shame-free wellness our brand was built on, we have been encouraging customers to stay in for a night of self-love to help avoid the pandemic!

Notably, moving his equity to an LLC and not, say, an established 501(c)(3) non-profit allows Dorsey an added level of control over how the funds are allocated. It follows in the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg, who in 2015 pledged to ""give"" 99 percent of his Facebook shares to an LLC of his creation over the course of his life. 
Why pull just from Square and not Twitter? Simply: I own a lot more Square. And Ill need to pace the sales over some time. The impact this money will have should benefit both companies over the long-term because its helping the people we want to serve.

""The needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime,"" wrote Dorsey of his decision. ""I hope this inspires others to do something similar. Life is too short, so let's do everything we can today to help people now.""

They labeled this group as ""higher risk."" 
However, another group of people could be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and hasn't received as much attention: people who smoke, vape or have substance use disorders. 
""[T]he research community should be alert to the possibility that [Covid-19] could hit some populations with substance use disorders particularly hard,"" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote in a blog post published last week. 
Because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape may be especially threatened, Volkow said. 
""When someone's lungs are exposed to flu or other infections the adverse effects of smoking or vaping are much more serious than among people who do not smoke or vape,"" Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control &amp; Education at University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a blog post updated Tuesday.
""Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia which push foreign things out...[T]he ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,"" Glantz said in a phone interview.
The CDC reported on Wednesday that young adults under age 44 make up a big part of Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US, and Glantz questions whether the vaping epidemic might have contributed to this.
""Some of my pulmonary [colleagues] have noted people under 30 [with Covid-19] ending up in hospitals and a couple were vapors,"" Glantz said. However, he said, there hasn't been enough research or evidence to support whether there's a link.
People who smoke are generally at an increased risk of serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, when they have a severe infection.
The odds of a Covid-19 case becoming more severe -- and at the most extreme, leading to death -- were 14 times higher among people who had a history of smoking compared to those who did not smoke, Glantz said, citing a study from China published in the peer-reviewed Chinese Medical Journal in February. The study also found those with a history of smoking had a 14% higher risk of developing pneumonia. 
Concerns about other drugs
Besides smoking and e-cigarettes, Volkow wrote that people who abuse opioids and methamphetamine may be at risk for serious complications of Covid-19 because of the effects these drugs have on respiratory and pulmonary health.
Opioids slow breathing and have already been shown to increase mortality in people with respiratory diseases, according to Volkow. ""[T]hus diminished lung capacity from COVID-19 could similarly endanger this population,"" she said.
Methamphetamine has been shown to produce significant pulmonary damage since it binds heavily to pulmonary tissue, Volkow explained in a phone interview. This will likely increase the risk of negative outcomes if used during a Covid-19 infection. 
People with substance use disorders also rely on treatment that traditionally involves human interaction, such as therapy sessions or methadone clinics, which will be challenging in the setting of wide-spread social distancing, according to Dr. Allison Lin, assistant professor in psychiatry and the addiction center at the University of Michigan.
Lin said it's important for everyone to quit smoking due to its unknown -- but potentially serious -- effects on Covid-19 patients. This is particularly important for people with substance use disorders since they are more likely to smoke, she said.
For everyone infected with Covid-19, one thing people can do now to reduce the risk of serious illness is quitting smoking, according to Glantz. 
""At a time when people are looking to reduce risk, it's very sensible to stop insulting your lungs,"" he said.

In 2017, she was distinguished as CNN Hero of the Year. The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)While the shutdown of routine daily life, including the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 outbreak, is like nothing most of us have ever experienced, I can't help feeling a little bit of déjà vu. 
When I was 15 and living in what was then my home in Aman, Jordan, my school closed for three months during the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War. I was terrified. Even though we were living through a war Jordan had sided with Iraq it was hard for me to imagine that it would come to this; school closures, not being able to see friends and constant worry about what would happen next. 
Today, I lead schools for refugee children in grades six to 12 near Atlanta, Georgia, and in Columbus, Ohio. And, as you can imagine, this isn't the first time my students have faced disruptions in their education. So, while I know this is tough for families I'm a mom to three young children myself parents should take comfort in knowing that kids are resilient, and we will get through this. 
I do think there are steps we can take, though, to ensure we do so as smoothly as possible.
Prioritize mental and physical health
First, I think it's important to remember that families' mental and physical health needs to be our top priority. Kids can't learn if they're hungry or sick. I know from working with my students at Fugees Academy schools that we can help kids catch up academically. But overcoming trauma and families will face trauma in the current environment will take more time.
We need to make sure those who are food insecure or facing urgent health care needs are getting access to meals and services. Communities that have activated their bus routes to deliver meals to those in need are setting a great example. And we need to ensure everyone is taking the time to exercise, get outdoors safely and connect by calling, texting and using social media tools. 
For example, the teachers at Fugees Academy schools are having morning check-ins using the Zoom videoconference service with 10 to 15 students at a time. Each day, they pose a question to their students to try to spark a conversation that will help them process their feelings. One of the questions we ask is, ""What are you afraid of?"" This lets us know if there are families in crisis that we need to try to help.
Time to bridge the digital divide
It's vital to be honest about the fact that connecting this way means ensuring all students have access to the internet and computer devices, which is not the reality for many kids. A Pew Research Center analysis of 2015 US Census Bureau data showed that 15% of households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home. The center's analysis also found that 12% of teens in the country do not have a computer at home, adding to the burden of what has come to be known as the ""homework gap.""
At our tuition-free independent schools, we've made computers available to our students. Thankfully, internet providers in our communities are giving free service to those in need at this time. That should happen broadly, and any government relief efforts around the current crisis ought to tackle bridging the digital divide.
Build routine and support teachers
It's not by chance we're having our teachers check in with students at 10 a.m. every day. Kids need routine and structure, and we've generally asked them to make 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. traditional learning time with breaks for lunch and exercise. 
Schools and school systems need to support teachers, who are being asked to do something entirely new. We first took a week for teacher training and then put class structures in place using tools like Zoom, ClassDojo and Google Classroom. We're being creative about using a private Facebook group to run soccer practices remotely. We can't debate who gets the corner kick, but we can run sprint drills and practice pushups and burpees together. We're also using the group for yoga classes and dance parties!
 Greater accountability and flexibility
While we're trying to make this version of school fun for our students, we're letting them know we're holding them accountable. I know some school systems are saying the semester will be graded on a pass/fail basis, but we want to motivate kids to try hard and have decided to give grades but be flexible on how we assess student work.
We're taking care to assign homework that's manageable. Without access to a teacher in person, it probably doesn't make sense to assign problem sets that are going to have kids getting stuck or spinning their wheels. 
As I mentioned, I'm a mom to three kids, ages 1, 4 and 5 a lot younger than the students who attend Fugees Academy schools. My wife, Emily, and I are only asking our pre-K and kindergarten daughters to do about an hour's worth of academic work each day. But that doesn't mean we're not sneaking in learning when we plant a garden and space out the plants or bake a cake and measure the ingredients. 
And while this is a great time to try activities you might not ordinarily have time to do, it's important to stick with routines and traditions. That's why we still have Friday family movie nights, focusing on funny and uplifting films. Olaf, from ""Frozen,"" had us all giggling last week. Humor is such a help.
Perspective is critical, too. We'll get through this. I know firsthand that it can be hard to keep perspective at times like this. But I'm hopeful we'll come out of it for the better having kept a close eye on the most vulnerable among us, a clear-eyed view of the need for greater equity in our education system, a deep appreciation for our schools and teachers and great love for our family and friends."

The study used an antibody blood test to estimate how many people had been infected with Covid-19 in the past. Other tests, like those performed with nasal swabs or saliva, test for the virus' genetic material, which does not persist long after recovery, as antibodies do.
""We found that there are many, many unidentified cases of people having Covid infection that were never identified with it with a virus test,"" said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and one of the paper's authors. ""It's consistent with findings from around the world that this disease, this epidemic is further along than we thought.""
The study estimated that 2.49% to 4.16% of people in Santa Clara Country had been infected with Covid-19 by April 1. This represents between 48,000 and 81,000 people, which is 50 to 85 times what county officials recorded by that date: 956 confirmed cases.
A preprint study is a draft version of a study released to the public that hasn't been peer-reviewed for publication in a journal. CNN has reached out to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department for comment.
Similar efforts to estimate local antibody prevalence have launched in places like Miami-Dade County, Florida; San Miguel County, Colorado; and Los Angeles, California. The National Institutes of Health has a similar effort underway as well.
Bhattacharya said information from these studies will not only give researchers a better idea on antibody prevalence, but they will also vastly improve projections and disease modeling. Experts have said it's clear there have been more people infected than we've tested for, but it's unclear how much higher that number could be.
""All of the projection models have this as an input: how many people have been infected today,"" Bhattacharya said.
""It just helps us plan better,"" he added. ""Before, we were making policy in the dark.""
The research may also give a more realistic sense of how deadly the virus really is.
""If I get the infection, how likely is it I'm going to die? That number depends on knowing how many people have had the infection -- not just actively have it now, but have had it and recovered from it,"" Bhattacharya said. 
If 50 times more people have had the infection, the death rate could drop by that same factor, putting it ""somewhere between 'little worse than the flu' to 'twice as bad as the flu' in terms of case fatality rate,"" Bhattacharya said. 
But he cautioned that the flu and coronavirus are still quite different. For one, we don't yet have a vaccine for Covid-19.
Doctors suspect, though, and are still trying to prove beyond a doubt, that antibodies to Covid-19 mean one is immune down the line.
The study in Santa Clara County recruited participants largely using Facebook ads targeted by zip code to sample various parts of the community. The study tested 3,330 adults and children.
""They had about five different tents set up and you just kind of drove through and they pricked your finger, took a blood sample and took down your information,"" one of those participants, Tony Huston, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast, ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""
""I think it's human nature to want to know if you've had it or if you have the antibodies,"" Huston said."

""He was truly a prolific talent and even more so, a loving and devoted father, son and friend."" 
It added: ""We are terribly sorry to convey this loss."" 
Schlesinger's band, which was co-founded with Chris Collingwood, was best known for its 2003 hit ""Stacy's Mom,"" a humorous track about a young boy who has a crush on his friend's mother. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award. 
But Schlesinger had success before that as a songwriter. He co-wrote the title track to the 1996 Tom Hanks film ""That Thing You Do,"" and received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for his work. 
After success with Fountains of Wayne, Schlesinger continued to branch out, earning Tony nominations for his work on the musical ""Cry-Baby"" and numerous Emmy nominations for other work, which included collaborations with Stephen Colbert and ""Sesame Street."" 
He won an Emmy last year for a song he co-wrote for CW's ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"" a show for which he wrote more than 100 songs and earned several nominations over the years. 
Schlesinger was hospitalized this week. 
A statement from his family, released by Collingwood via Twitter, confirmed Schlesinger was diagnosed with Covid-19. Schlesinger was put on a ventilator and sedated ""to facilitate his recovery."" 
""He is receiving excellent care, his condition is improving and we are cautiously optimistic,"" the statement said. ""His family appreciates all of the love and support."" 
News of his illness prompted an outpouring of well wishes from the music industry and beyond, as did word of his passing.

He added: ""We must take this seriously. People are sick and dying. It is hard to stay locked indoors but lives will be saved. Take care of each other. Rest In Peace, my dear friend.""
Schlesinger was writing the lyrics and music for a new theater production with comedian Sarah Silverman at the time of his death, the attorney's statement added. 
Schlesinger was survived by his two daughters, Sadie and Claire, his life partner Alexis Morley, his parents Barbara and Stephen Schlesinger and his sister Lauren, according to the statement."

Another New York hospital, this one in Hudson Valley, is also using music to bring a little joy to medical staff and patients who are battling the pandemic. Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus told a local radio show that the song ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey plays when a Covid-19 patient is released.
Other hospitals, just like in Austin, are lining the hallways and sending off their released patients with claps and cheers. In Arkansas, a veteran, who staff named their ""first miracle patient,"" waved to staff as he was greeted with signs of encouragement and applause as he was being escorted to his family waiting outside of the hospital.
The Intensive Care Staff at Yale New Haven Hospital Saint Raphael Campus in Connecticut cheered, clapped and held signs of encouragement for a patient that was being transferred out of the ICU and to a regular room.
Moments like these are being shared on social media and giving hope to others as the cases across the US top 530,000.

But British scientists are skeptical,"British scientists have pushed back against an influential new coronavirus model that predicts the UK will be the worst-hit European country, with a death toll from Covid-19 possibly much higher than previously thought.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/health/uk-death-toll-coronavirus-estimate-gbr-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200408113506-coronavirus-uk-0406-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-08T18:28:25Z,"London (CNN)British scientists have pushed back against an influential new coronavirus model that predicts the UK will be the worst-hit European country, with a death toll from Covid-19 possibly much higher than previously thought. 
The grim forecast came from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine in Seattle on Tuesday. It predicted 66,314 people would die of Covid-19 in the UK by early August. 
The British government's plan for tackling the epidemic has been largely informed by a study from the Imperial College London, which said that a lockdown and social distancing measures would -- hopefully -- limit the number of deaths to between 20,000 and 30,000.
But several high-profile scientists in the UK have already voiced their concerns over the IHME model. 
Professor Sylvia Richardson, of Cambridge University and the co-chair of the Royal Statistical Society Task Force on Covid-19, told the Science Media Centre theprojections are based on ""very strong assumptions about the way the epidemic will progress.""
She said the model was ""based mostly on using the experience in other countries to fit a smooth curve to the counts of deaths reported so far in the UK, rather than any modeling of the epidemic itself."" 
""Methods like this are well known for being extremely sensitive, and are likely to change dramatically as new information comes in,"" Richardson added.
Like most other countries, the UK has been racing to increase its healthcare capacity ahead of the predicted peak of the epidemic. A new field hospital in east London with a capacity of up to 5,000 beds, the NHS Nightingale, accepted its first patients on Wednesday. 
However, the IHME model suggests this might not be enough. It said the shortage of intensive care (ICU) beds would peak at 23,745 on April 17.
The IHME said the peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds, which compares to the 17,765 currently available. It added that 24,544 ICU beds will be needed, compared to the 799 beds it estimates will be available.
Professor David Spiegelhalter, who chairs the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at University of Cambridge, told the Science Media Centre he was ""very skeptical"" of the projections. 
""[They] are based on assuming a rather simple mathematical model for the whole course of the epidemic,"" he said. ""I suspect they will change a lot as new data arrives -- we shall see.""
Epidemiological modeling is a tricky discipline, because it relies in part on assumptions. The models often need updating as more data comes in.
""The outputs of any model should not really be treated as a prediction of what is going to happen,"" said Dr. Simon Gubbins, head of the Transmission Biology Group at The Pirbright Institute in England. ""Rather they represent plausible scenarios, based on knowledge at the time they were generated and assumptions made in the model ... that can be used to help inform decisions of policy makers,"" he told the Science Media Centre.
The authors of the IHME forecast admit their model is highly uncertain, giving the range of possible deaths in the UK as between55,022 and 79,995.
This was the first time the IHME team published models for several European countries, including the UK. On Wednesday, the institute updated its US forecast, predicting 60,415 deaths in the country, significantly fewer than the 82,000 it predicted on Tuesday.
The researchers based their findings on models of the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan, the Chinese city which was the original epicenter of the outbreak, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including the Spanish capital of Madrid and the Lombardy region in Italy.
They also factored in data from local and national governments, the World Health Organization and information on each country's social distancing policies.

The Office for National Statistics said 42,173 people had died in England and Wales with suspected COVID-19 as of May 15, bringing the UK total to 47,343 - which includes earlier data from Scotland, Northern Ireland, plus recent hospital deaths in England. 
While different ways of counting make comparisons with other countries difficult, the figure underlined Britain’s status as one of the world’s worst-hit countries in a pandemic that has killed at least 345,400 globally. 
Johnson, already under fire for his handling of the pandemic, has had to defend his top adviser Dominic Cummings who drove 250 miles from London to access childcare when Britons were being told to stay at home to fight COVID-19.

Swiss health authorities have reported here more than 33,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nearly 1,700 deaths from the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
Switzerland last month phased out most of the restrictions it imposed to contain the spread of the virus, declaring the country better equipped to handle any fresh flare-ups. 
New cases have dwindled to dozens a day, allowing schools, shops and borders with fellow members of the Schengen passport-free travel zone to reopen as life returns to near-normal. 
Passengers on public transport however still have to don facemasks.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday morning, said it's likely U.S. schools might have to ""shut down"" and public transportation"" could likely be affected -- but only in an offhand comment about the virus not being ""a death sentence.""
Recounting how he had gotten a note from a reporter asking what hes going to do to calm the markets, he said he might tell people to turn off their televisions.
It is real? It absolutely is real, Mulvaney said while adding that 20 million Americans get the flu each year. This is not Ebola, OK? Its not SARS, its not MERS, he said, referring to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, pointing to their high fatality rates.
Its not a death sentence, he said. Its much easier to get than Ebolabut this is something we know how to deal with.
Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. May you see impacts on public transportation? Sure. But we do this. We know how to handle this,"" he added.
Mulvaney said the administration visited the Capitol earlier this year, for briefings with health experts for the House and Senate, but few members showed up as Trump's Senate impeachment trial was underway.
We took extraordinary steps four of five weeks ago. Why didnt you hear about it? What was going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment! Mulvaney said. And thats all the press wanted to talk about.
He also mentioned the travel restrictions against China Trump ordered over a month ago, in order to prevent the further outbreak, complaining that some Democrats complained the move was racist.
The press was covering their hoax of the day because they thought it might bring down the president, he said. The reason youre seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to bring down the president.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, also speaking at CPAC and echoing comments made on Fox News, contended Democrats will take anything that they can use to try to hurt Trump.
Anything he does in a positive sensethey will not give him credit for, he said. The playbook is old at this point, but for them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here, and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness.
He also addressed the falling markets.
There's no question that the threat of coronavirus can destabilize the market, but the fact that the Democrats are seemingly hoping for this to happen, just like you've seen them over the last year, pray for a disaster to happen in the economy, meaning people lose their jobs, their mortgages, their livelihoods, so that they can own Trump somehow, is absolutely insane, he said.
Watching 50 percent of our U.S. government pray for that to collapse, pray for the destruction of those families and those jobs is truly a new low for Democrats that have been exceeding lows in an unprecedented fashion over the last few years, he said.
On Fox News, host Sean Hannity opened his program Thursday night saying, ""I can report the sky is absolutely falling. We're all doomed. The end is near. The apocalypse is imminent and you're going to die, all of you, in the next 48 hours and it's all President Trump's fault -- or at least that's what the media mob and the Democratic extreme radical Socialist Party would like you to think.""
President Trump Thursday evening said of the novel coronavirus, ""like a miracle, it will disappear"" but that ""nobody really knows.""
""It's like a miracle -- it will disappear,"" Trump said in an unscheduled gathering in the Cabinet room with members of the African American community. ""And from our shores, you know, it could get worse before it gets better. Could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.""
After introductions around the table, the president launched into a staunch defense of his administrations handling of coronavirus, while slamming the media and Democrats for bringing politics into the response.
I know politics, and you know, politics is fine, Trump said. But when it comes time to talk about pandemics or whatever you may want to call it, you got to get away from politics.

He also gave his administration high marks, saying the response so far has been incredible.
If we're doing a great job, we should congratulate these professionals that are the best in the world. And you know what, if we were doing a bad job, we should also be criticized, but we have done an incredible job,"" he added.
Trump did not mention the stock market, which plunged for the fifth day in a row Friday, falling more than 800 points after the opening bell, but he said earlier in the week it ""will recover.""

Shortly after, at another White House Black History month event, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touted Trump's decision to close U.S. borders to travelers from China and other nations, saying ""it has kept America safe"" and ""bought us time.""
""The president really deserves incredible credit because he got on this within days and weeks of learning from China about this and took action that people attacked him for,"" Azar said. ""People attacked him for these actions on controlling our borders and quarantining people that has kept America safe. It has bought us time, so thank you, Mr. President.""
Vice President Mike Pence, who held a photo op with Azar Thursday to publicly show he was taking the lead in the administration effort, was headed to Florida Friday to deliver remarks to make a political speech at the Club for Growths annual conference in West Palm Beach and later speak at a GOP fundraiser for House Republicans in Sarasota, Florida.
While there are no confirmed cases in Florida so far, the vice president scheduled a meeting in between the political events with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.
House members on Friday morning assembled on Capitol Hill for a closed briefing on the novel coronavirus from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIAID), and other administration officials and federal health professionals.
Sources told ABC News on Thursday that all statements to the public, including those from officials with the Centers for Disease Control to Health and Human Services, must first be cleared through the vice president's office.
Critics say that has the potential for the White House to censor information.
But lawmakers in the House briefing said Dr. Fauci told them he had not been put under a gag order.
Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Friday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pressed by House Democrats for both the admin's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak -- though the original reason for the hearing was to address the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani more than two months ago.
Asked about the administration's proposed cuts to the global health budget, Pompeo said with a smile, ""We'll have plenty of money.""
Democrats jumped in to say the administration's lost credibility and sent mixed messages on the COVID-19 oubtreak, at first prompting Pompeo to push back that the hearing was supposed to be about Iran.
Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, accused the administration of a ""blatant disregard for facts,"" saying it's left the American people unsure of whom to trust. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., condemned what he called a ""pattern"" of ""misinformation""-- pointing to Trump's statements on vaccines and warm weather.
""This impacts everyone in America -- and it's more important than politics Mr. Secretary. The administration must do better,"" he said.
Several Republicans pushed back against the Democrats in the room, with Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., calling their behavior an ""embarrassment"" and the hearing a ""joke."" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. said they were ""out of hand"" and he was ""deeply angry"" at them.
On the COVID-19 outbreak, Pompeo said the U.S. has reached out to Iran and through its partners to offer U.S. assistance.

When up and running, the system will allow Android and iOS users to be notified if they’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19 — if that other person has also opted into being tracked by Bluetooth. Perhaps the need to win the public’s trust is also part of the thinking behind the companies’ new shift to calling their system “exposure notification” instead of “contact tracing.”
The rollout of this system will come in phases.Google and Apple are targeting a pre-release for public-health app developers as soon as next week. This wouldn’t mean the functionality is available to users yet. But it would mean that developers can start to test the seed version of the OS update supporting their new APIs. Apple and Google noted new functions in the API would allow developers to decide for themselves how physically close two phones would have to be to register an interaction, as well as for how long.
Public health authorities, such as the UK’s National Health Service, are ultimately going to create the apps that users will download and opt into, not Apple and Google. A full launch of the API is still slated for mid-May, which will allow for broader testing and the ultimate launch of health authority apps. The next phase will be adding interfaces directly into Android and iOS to allow users to activate and disable beaconing on a system-wide level. This, the companies say, will take months.
These are all still the early stages of developinga mammoth infrastructure to help countries trace the spread of COVID-19, paving the way to a reopening of society.

Japan’s delay in launching the app has left some concerned about its effectiveness.

In countries that adopted contact-tracing apps early on, such as Singapore and Iceland, that figure stands at around just 40 percent. Integrating the technology with existing apps is also a no-go, due to Apple and Google’s stipulations.

To log into the app, workers will have to take a daily wellness check. If they confirm symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough or difficulty breathing, they’ll be logged off for the day and told to contact their physician. Independent contractors (known as “full-service” shoppers) and part-time employees (in-store shoppers, shift leads and site managers) who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or forced to quarantine will still receive up to 14 days of financial assistance.
Chances are these measures won’t appease workers who went on strike a few weeks ago. Instacart tried to avoid the demonstration by making a few concessions, but shoppers said those didn’t go far enough. They pointed out that there’s still no sick pay for workers who stay home due to health conditions that put them at a high risk and that the company failed to address demands for hazard pay.
Shoppers also criticized Instacart for not providing hand sanitizer fast enough. Just a few days ago, many shoppers said they still hadn’t received the promised safety gear.
In its announcement today, Instacart promised in-store shoppers, shift leads and site managers will continue to receive bonuses ranging from $25 to $200 -- but that appears to leave out full-service shoppers. Instacart is also making it possible to request “health and safety” kits with masks and hand sanitizer from the Instacart Shopper app.
Instacart will continue offering a contactless delivery option. The company has also expanded its Costco pharmacy deliveries nationwide. It’s working on a “first available shopper” option to expedite deliveries, and it now lets customers order up to two weeks ahead, instead of one.
Of course, Instacart isn’t alone in its struggle to provide worker protections and meet a growing demand for grocery delivery. Nearly all online grocery delivery services are facing unprecedented stress and having their vulnerabilities exposed."

Hints of protective immunity against the pandemic coronavirus have surfaced in the wake of a recent COVID-19 outbreak that flooded the crew of a fishing vessel.
The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, infected 104 of the 122 people on board, about 85 percent, during a short voyage. But trawling through data collected before and after the ship set sail, researchers noted that the 18 spared from infection just happened to include the only three people on board that had potent, pre-existing immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the three sailors were the only ones found to have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, which are proteins that circulate in the blood and completely sink the infectious virus.
The numbers are small and the finding is not definitive. Additionally, the study appeared this month on a pre-print server, meaning it has not been published by a scientific journal or gone through peer review. Still, experts say the study was well done and significant for netting data that hint that potent, pre-existing immune responses from a past infection can indeed protect someone from catching the virus again.
While this is a small study, it offers a remarkable, real-life, human experiment at a time when weve been short of hardline, formal, proof that neutralizing antibodies genuinely offer protection from re-infection, as predicted by animal models, Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said in a media statement.
Viral catch
For the study, researchers in Seattle, Washington were able to test 120 members of the 122-person crew before they set sail. They looked for active infections by probing for SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in noses, and they looked for past infections by probing for antibodies that develop toward the end of an infection. All 120 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in their nose. Six, however, had antibodies against the pandemic virus.
On further examination of those six with antibodies, only three had neutralizing antibodies, the researchers found. Though all antibodies suggest past exposure to a virus, not all antibodies can neutralize viruses. And neutralizing antibodies are considered critical for protective immunity.
The researchers cant say for sure what was going on with the three who had some antibodies, but not neutralizing antibodies. Their best guess is that they simply had false positive test results and didnt truly have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. But its also possible that they had waning antibody responses, perhaps from a distant infection at the beginning of the infection, or a burgeoning antibody response during the early stages of an infection. Regardless, after the ship set sail and the COVID-19 outbreak struck, all three were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Immunity inklings
When the ship returned after about 16 days at sea, with sick aboard, the researchers re-tested all the crew members and followed them for up to 32 days. A total of 104 were infected, including one of the two crew members they didnt initially test.
As for the three with neutralizing antibodies, initial tests for SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in their noses were all negative. Two of the three tested negative at three different timesfrom the day they got off the boat to 18 days later. The third crew member tested negative after three and ten days of disembarking. But, in a data wrinkle, this person had very weakly positive tests seven days and 13 days after getting off the boat. The tests didnt qualify as positive, based on preset criteria. But it does suggest some remnant viral material was lingering in the persons nosewhich has been seen in other studies.Despite the limitations of the study and quarks of the data, experts say it's well done and helpful information. Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, noted in a media statement that although the study was small and leaves questions lingering, it gives us important insight into the type of immunity that might protect from future infection."

Enlarge/ Lifestyle photo of Fitbit Sense.
Fitbit has just launched three new fitness trackers: the Inspire 2, Versa 3, and the brand-new Fitbit Sense. While they focus on the requisite tracking metrics weve come to expect from Fitbit, the company is also hoping theyll further impact users mindfulness of stress and, eventually, recognize warning signs for COVID-19, among other illnesses.
The Fitbit Sense retails for $330 and offers sensors for ECG (to be activated pending FDA clearance), skin temperature, and electrodermal activity (EDA) for quantifying stress levels. The Versa 3 comes in at $100 less for $230 and lacks those three sensors, while the Versa 2 still offers nearly the same features as its successor at a more amenable $180. Lastly, the Inspire 2with its more simplistic, OLED touchscreen and better battery lifecan be had for $100.
All three trackers come with complimentary memberships for new Fitbit Premium users, which lends insight into longer health trends and offers guided workouts and even one-on-one health coaching with tailored fitness regimens and consultations. The Sense and Versa 3 only get six free months, while Inspire 2 owners get even more bang for their buck with 12 months included. Fitbit users can also opt in to the companys study, which tracks various biological metrics in an attempt to detect COVID-19 infection before the onset of more demonstrative symptoms.
At this juncture, Fitbit has compiled data from over 100,000 users with at least 1,000 confirmed cases, picking up on trends related to breathing, heart-rate variability (HRV), and other less obvious signs that the body has become infected. Taken together with data voluntarily entered into the applike symptoms, for examplethe company hopes to develop an algorithm that can pass regulatory scrutiny and help Fitbit users detect COVID-19 infection earlier. Of course, the regulatory bit will provide some hurdles when the algorithm is ready for such assessment.
The Sense, by all accounts, appears to be Fitbits newest flagship and is the most feature-rich of the three. A stainless steel border surrounding the display encompasses the ECG and EDA sensors, allowing users to place their palm over it for on-the-spot readings of their ECG and stress levels, respectively.
The ECG function is pending FDA clearance and, as such, isnt yet available. But once the function is approved, Fitbit says it will be able detect atrial fibrillation, much like weve seen on the Apple Watch Series 5 whose ECG sensor is currently FDA-approved and functional. The EDA sensor picks up on electrical changes happening on the surface of the skin, which could be a potential indicator for the bodys stress response. But since this function is only able to assess this when you start an EDA session, its hard to see this telling you anything you didnt already know if youre activating a stress-check session to begin with.
Perhaps more insightful is the daily Stress Management Score. It uses data from these sensors and the temperature sensor (these three are exclusive to the Sense in Fitbits lineup) along with your heart-rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen levels (SPO2), and about seven other metrics to form this daily health grade. Its a number from zero to 100higher is bettermeant to lend insight into how your sleep and physical activity (or lack thereof) are impacting your health. This type of daily health score isnt wholly new to the field, but it is something you wont find on an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch.
Other than these features, the Sense is essentially a Fitbit Versa 3, with its full-color, always-on touchscreen display, built-in GPS, swim-proofing, Alexa and Google Assistant, a variety of watch bands (including the new infinity bands that latch in much the same way Apple Watches do), Fitbit Pay contactless payment, fast charging, and a battery life of about six days.
The Versa 3 doesnt have much on the Versa 2, though. Topping the list of additions is Google Assistant, fast charging, the ability to take calls on-device via Bluetooth connection to Android phones, and pace and distance data for GPS-tracked workouts overlaid on your route. That leaves the $230 Versa 3 in an awkward position, as the Versa 2 will still be sold for $50 less. While these additions may justify the extra expense for some, iPhone users especially wont be among this subset. That is because the Apple Watch Series 3 can be had for $10 less ($170) while offering the same features (minus native sleep tracking) but with a world more apps.

Meanwhile, if youd like to skip those functionalities altogether and dont care about a watch-like appearance, the Inspire 2 is nearly half the price of the Versa 2, selling for an even $100. Its a more traditional fitness tracker in terms of the form factor that put Fitbit on the map. But even this digital OLED display has a touchscreen and watchbands in leather, fabric, and metal options. Plus, the 10-day battery life (versus six on the Sense and Versas) might be the best perk of them all.
You wont be able to play music via Pandora and Deezer or control your Spotify playback like the Versa and Sense can, although were upset you still cant play Spotify directly from either of them. But the requisite fitness features are all here: sleep tracking, GPS, swim-proofing, and guided workouts are among the many bells and whistles all within the Inspire 2s wheelhouse. Even better, new users will get access to Fitbit Premium for double the timeone full yearas opposed to the six months offered on the Versa 3 and Sense.
The Fitbit Inspire 2 comes in black, pink, and white, while the Versa and Sense come in black and gold. Pre-orders start today with the Sense launching at $330, the Versa 3 at $230, and the Inspire 2 selling for $100. Orders ship September 25.

Still, these safety plans largely require kids to conscientiously obey strict rules something kids aren't exactly known for doing, least of all school bullies.
Comedian Karan Menon released a hilarious short video on Wednesday imagining how bullies might behave if they obeyed COVID-19 social distancing rules. Playing both parties in a schoolyard confrontation, Menon's teens aggressively size each other up from a respectful six-foot distance, claiming they'd absolutely deliver a massive beatdown if it were safe to do so.
""You must be out of your mind if you think I'm gonna risk having a crowd gather around this fight as they inevitably do,"" growls Menon in the viral two-minute clip. ""The level of social distancing would be extremely low. Like your grades!""
SEE ALSO: Teachers are doing their best to make socially distanced classrooms less scary
Menon even managed to build out some compelling backstory for his safety-conscious teenagers, including a grandparent with a lung problems and a family restaurant that couldn't secure a Paycheck Protection Program loan.
""A lot of that money got taken up by billionaire-backed corporations when it was supposed to go to small businesses,"" says Menon. ""And you know how I feel about small business!""
""The backbone of this economy!"" the other bully concurs belligerently.
""I'd knock the shit out of your backbone if Dr. Fauci was okay with it!""
Menon is building up a solidly funny catalogue of ruthlessly efficient sketches and TikToks illustrating concepts like qualified immunity, systemic voter suppression, and why saying ""All Lives Matter"" is bullshit usually starring himself, himself, and occasionally even himself."

The deaths of the patients took place over the last 24 hours, but NYC Health and Hospitals/Elmhurst said in a statement that number is consistent with the number of Intensive Care Unit patients being treated there.
""Staff are doing everything in our power to save every person who contracts Covid-19,"" the statement said. 
New York has more than 30,000 of the nation's more than 65,000 coronavirus cases, and 285 of its residents have died fromthe virus. The state has called for tens of thousands more ventilators, hospital beds and intensive care beds to meet the needs of their hospitals. 
Elmhurst is at the center of the crisis, the statement said, and staff is working to overcome the overwhelming numbers.
""The frontline staff are going above and beyond in this crisis, and we continue surging supplies and personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis,"" the statement said.
""We are literally increasing the effective capacity of the hospital on a daily basis by sending more doctors, nurses, ventilators and PPE to meet demand.""
New York has ordered residents to stay at home to curb the spread of the virus and hopefully ease pressures on healthcare systems. And though Gov. Andrew Cuomo pointed to Westchester County -- home to thestate's first severe outbreak in New Rochelle -- as a marker for the effectiveness of social distancing, cases continue to climb.
Estimates from Sunday showed coronavirus hospitalizations were doubling every 2 days, he said. But Monday's estimates showed hospitalizations were doubling every 3.4 days, and Tuesday's estimates showed hospitalizations were doubling every 4.7 days.
Cuomo warned that the rest of the nation could see numbers like those in his state.
""Where we are today, you will be in three weeks or four weeks or five weeks or six weeks,"" he said. ""What we do here will chart the course.""

CNN spoke with five hospital workers at Sinai-Grace Hospital, part of the Detroit Medical Center system, who said staff members feel they don't have enough coworkers or supplies to deal with the crisis.
Many of the patients in the ER are presumed Covid-19 positive because they have viral symptoms, but their test results take days to process, hospital workers said.
Conditions are so drastic at Sinai-Grace that on Sunday night, all of the emergency room's night shift nursing staff --seven in total -- staged a sit-in, where they refused to work and demanded that more nurses be sent in to help. 
Patients at Sinai-Grace aren't just two-to-a-room -- they have been lining many of the hallways in the emergency room, according to the four health care workers. Two workers said critically ill patients, including ventilated patients, have been at times kept in the hallways.
At least two patients in the ER have died in hallway beds, according to a physician at the facility. Health care workers at the hospital, including the physician, spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their jobs.
""We've had patients die in hallway beds because the nurse didn't find they didn't have a pulse until it was too late,"" the physician said. ""Each nurse has so many patients that by the time they come to check on their next one, there is a chance that patient may not have a pulse anymore.""
Another patient's breathing tube disconnected from the ventilator, and the patient died before staff could respond, two ER workers told CNN. 
Michigan has the third-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the US, behind New York and New Jersey, according to Johns Hopkins University. Cases have skyrocketed from 300 less than a month ago to over 20,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.
A number of hospitals around the country are nearing or have reached capacity because of the surge in Covid-19 patients.
Out of respect for the privacy of the patient and family members, Brian Taylor, Detroit Medical Center communications and media relations director said the medical center would not be providing or commenting on any details regarding the care of any particular patient. 
""It's important to understand that everyday emergency rooms all over the country face dynamic situational challenges and even more so now in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis,"" he said.
Although Detroit Medical Center did not address the specific situations raised by the hospital workers, they provided CNN with a lengthy statement explaining the difficult situation it is in.
""Like many hospital systems, the demand to care for the ever-increasing number of patients is putting a strain on our resources and staff,"" Taylor told CNN in a statement. ""Surge plans are in place at our hospital to handle the increase in patient volumes to ensure we provide the safest and most appropriate care for our patients.""
The Sinai-Grace emergency room has more traffic than any other hospital in metro Detroit and it's the only hospital in Northwest Detroit, Taylor said. There are also a large number of nursing homes in its vicinity, so the hospital is receiving more critically ill patients, Taylor said.
Sinai-Grace's patient population has, ""extremely high rates of underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, which puts people at higher risk for COVID-19,"" Taylor said.
The hospital has been using all available space, Taylor said, including converted operating rooms, outpatient areas and recovery rooms, to handle the surge. It's also working to move patients from hospital to hospital within their system, or to other hospitals in the region.
""We are safely and appropriately using the necessary supplies and equipment, including monitors and ventilators, to care for our patients and are continually sourcing around the world for additional supplies as the number of COVID-19 patients needing care continues to grow,"" he said in his statement.
Workers at Sinai-Grace, though, said that with the increase in patients, the hospital at times hasn't had enough of the cardiac monitors that sound an alarm when a patient's vital signs change, according to three of the health care workers. 
Staff members have also had to make hard decisions about who even gets monitors. 
""We've done our best with monitors,"" one ER worker said. ""But we have patients that we know are going to pass so we take them off a monitor and give [it] to someone else that needs [it].""
According to that worker, one patient without a monitor died in the ER hallway. The patient was showing signs of rigor mortis by the time staff members were aware that the patient had died.
'We do our best to be next to them when they pass'
Even if a patient is on a monitor and alarms begin to go off, staff isn't always able to respond in time, two ER employees said.
In at least two instances, even though monitor alarms had gone off, the hospital was so busy that by the time nurses were able to get there, the patients had died, the ER employees said. 
""(The nurses) walked up to them and they had no pulses,"" one ER worker said. ""They were on the monitor, but it was too much to watch everyone safely."" 
For patients, specifically elderly ones with high risk factors for Covid-19, two ER workers told CNN that staff at Sinai-Grace are calling the families of elderly patients and, ""encouraging them to make patient DNR (do-not-resuscitate)/DNI (do-not-intubate)."" 
That means that if a patient goes into respiratory or cardiac arrest, staff says they do not attempt to intervene and let the patient pass. 
During their shifts, hospital employees are not working to resuscitate some patients that have, or are presumed to have, Covid-19, according to three members of the ER staff. Performing CPR or restarting a patient's heart would mean employees would be exposed to Covid-19, said one worker.
CNN specifically asked about the ER staff's policies of calling patient families, and not resuscitating presumed Covid-19 patients, but Taylor did not respond directly to that.
There is no hospital-wide do-not-resuscitate policy, DMC's Taylor told CNN.
""As for decisions on whether a patient receives CPR, these decisions are made on a case by case basis by physicians and the medical care team,"" Taylor said. ""If a patient requires CPR of course the patient will receive CPR."" 
""We do our best to be next to them when they pass,"" another ER worker said, ""But oftentimes all of the nurses are busy with other patients."" 
When patients do die, staff members have to quickly move them to temporary refrigerated storage that's been brought in, two hospital workers said.
""We have to put people next to each other and on top of each other, because it's been non-stop,"" one said. ""I do my best to close their eyes and say a little prayer.""
Tubes, cords, even ventilators crowd the ER hallways
Ventilated Covid-19 patients are normally kept in an isolated room because the ventilator can aerosolize the virus -- especially if the ventilator tube disconnects -- spreading it through the air, according to multiple healthcare workers across the US that CNN has spoken with.
There are so many patients in stretchers in the hallways that electrical cords and even oxygen tubes are littering them, two health care workers said, describing the extraordinary measures they are taking to handle the situation. They have to keep the cords and tubes in the hallways, they said, because they are all necessary supplies that keep the patients -- some who are critically ill -- alive.
The hospital is still treating walk-ins and ambulance arrivals, including non-Covid-19 patients, according to four health care workers.
""There's times walking into that hospital it looks like a third world country in a war zone,"" one Detroit emergency medical technician, who has transported patients to Sinai-Grace, told CNN.
""Walking through is an eerie feeling,"" the EMT said. ""Nurses, physicians and respiratory therapists running around, everyone is on a vent, every vent is beeping, patients are on multiple IV drips. You would've thought it was a military hospital in a war zone.""

Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus, but there wasn't much to it. 
All she had was a really low-grade temperature, one that the doctors didn't even really consider to be a fever, she said. She had some congestion, but she was on the mend. He wasn't all that worried, either, when he started feeling unwell. After all, they were both young and healthy.
The two worked in the Cliffside Park School District in New Jersey, both as special education teachers -- she at School #4, he at School #6. A star baseball player in high school, he continued his passion by coaching the varsity baseball team. 
For Ben, however, his symptoms quickly became more severe. He had more shortness of breath, and by the last Friday in March, he told Brandy it was time to go to the emergency room. ""He was really concerned,"" Brandy says. ""He came into our bedroom where I was laying, and he said, you know, I've got to go, I've got to take myself to the hospital."" 
""Are you sure you want to go there?"" she asked him. He said ""Yes, I need to."" Immediately, Brandy drove him to the hospital. She couldn't go in with him, though, because they weren't accepting visitors. So, she sat in the car the entire evening and they texted back and forth. ""He updated me the whole time,"" she said. 
At the hospital, Ben received oxygen and responded well, Brandy said. They gave him fluids and Tylenol and then sent him home that same evening. ""Keep doing what you're doing at home,"" they said.
The following Sunday, he was feeling better and showing signs of improvement, his wife said. He got out of bed and ate dinner for the first time.
""Sunday was a great day. He was up moving around, talking to us,"" Brandy said. Ben was on the road to recovery, it seemed. That night, however, his symptoms returned.
""Ben always said the nights had been the worst for him, he would sweat and when he laid down a certain way,"" Brandy said. ""It was particularly hard for him to breathe.""
That night, Ben had an especially hard time getting comfortable. Because Ben was sleeping in the bedroom, and Brandy on the couch, they were texting back and forth to communicate. At one point, Ben texted his wife and said, ""I'm struggling."" Brandy asked him if he needed to go back to the ER, and Ben replied that he wasn't sure.
""So, I just tried to do as much as I could to make him comfortable, you know, calm down his breathing, you know, get him to cool down,"" Brandy said. She borrowed a humidifier from a friend to try that. 
Once Ben finally settled into bed, Brandy listened through the door of their bedroom.
""I could hear through the door that he was still breathing, and I fell asleep,"" she said. She checked in on him again at 2 a.m, and all seemed OK. However, when she woke at 6 a.m., she found her 30-year-old husband lifeless in their bed. 
""Whether he knew you for five minutes or he knew you for his whole entire life, he would give you the same respect and try to reach out and help you and make you laugh in any way possible. That was just the type of selfless person he was,"" remembered Brandy. 
As I listened to Brandy tell the story, my heart broke for her. They were husband and wife, but also best friends, both working in the same school district, driving to work every day. She didn't know what she would do with herself on Monday, let alone the rest of her life. 
And Brandy was left with a mystery. She knew her husband was sick, but how was it possible that a young, healthy 30-year-old with no pre-existing conditions declined so swiftly?
Ben Luderer's story is one of many that have perplexed health officials around the globe. Why is it that some young people are getting sick and dying so abruptly? 
It is true that Covid-19 seems to most seriously affect older people, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. It could be that an elderly person's immune systems may not be able to fight off the disease as well, and the virus can more easily replicate, overwhelming the body and causing multiple organ system failure.
And yet, as we start to look deeper and hear more stories, it is becoming apparent there are many people like Ben, who are younger and still get very sick and die. I recently heard the story of 39-year-old Conrad Buchanan, a healthy, vivacious Florida DJ, who also died after having coronavirus despite having no underlying conditions, according to his wife. 
We have known for some time that this new disease, Covid-19, was not only an older person's disease. It has become clear that the young and healthy are by no means immune to this infection and could become sick enough to require hospitalization. 
In an early snapshot from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for 2,449 patients whose age was known, 18% were between age 45 and 54, and 29% were between 20 and 44 years old. Among those who were hospitalized, 18% were ages 45 to 54 and 20% were ages 20 to 44.
Younger people are far less likely to die, but there is an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging. As Dr. Anthony Fauci told me, it is what makes the coronavirus such an ""unusual disease."" 
""I'm fascinated,"" he said, "" ... by what I would call the pathogenesis.""
""You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a cardio-pulmonary machine) and they're dead,"" Fauci told me when I interviewed him for my podcast, ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" 
""I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out.""
So, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die.
One possibility is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene. ACE2 is an enzyme that that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart. In an article in Science magazine, Immunologist Dr. Philip Murphy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that ""variations in the ACE2 gene that alter the receptor could make it easier or harder for the virus to get into lung cells."" 
It is also possible that a critical ingredient produced by the body, known as surfactant, which better allows the lungs to expand and contract, becomes depleted in some patients infected with the coronavirus. If you think of your lungs as a sponge, surfactant would be the detergent which would make them soft and pliable. Without surfactant, however, your lung becomes stiff and hard to squeeze. It may be why some patients continue to struggle even on a breathing machine.
Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place. In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs. In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well. Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.
Perhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.
To better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age. While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people, like Ben and Conrad, we need to better understand. 
For now, no matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same. Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible. Even if you do develop mild symptoms, it is probably best to stay home to recover. 
But if you develop trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, sudden confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, please, it is time to go to the hospital. 
 Ben Luderer's wife says doctors still can't explain exactly what happened.
 ""We don't really know,"" Brandy told us. ""I don't really know.""
For now, all she can do is take things minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day to process how quickly her life changed.
""Ben and I were the type of couple that did everything together,"" she said. ""So, it's very hard understanding where to go with this when you don't have your partner in life that you did everything with. So, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it."""

Rand Paul of Kentucky announced Tuesday that he has successfully recovered from his bout with the novel coronavirus and is now volunteering at a hospital to help patients stricken with Covid-19. 
""I appreciate all the best wishes I have received. I have been retested and I am negative. I have started volunteering at a local hospital to assist those in my community who are in need of medical help, including Coronavirus patients. Together we will overcome this!"" Paul, who is also a doctor, wrote in a tweet. 
The tweet included a photo of the senator, half-smiling and wearing a white lab coat. 
The announcement comes a little over two weeks after Paul announced he had been diagnosed with coronavirus, making him the first known US senator to have been infected with it. 
Paul, who, at the time, said he was asymptomatic, had faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike following his diagnosis because he had hadn't self-quarantined while he awaited his results. GOP senators told CNN last month that Paul was in the gym with colleagues the morning of the day he announced his positive results, and several pointed out how close he had sat to others during Senate lunches at the time. 
The senator later defended his actions, saying in a statement following his diagnosis that ""the current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.""
In addition to Paul, four US representatives also tested positive for coronavirus last month, while one more said they had ""been diagnosed with presumed coronavirus infection.""
The virus has so far infected more than 378,000 Americans and claimed the lives of more than 11,000 Americans, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University."

For one, the Roman Catholic church, like others around the world, will celebrate its most important day remotely, with Masses and prayers being held over Zoom.
But at St. Gabriel, a critical figure within the parish community will be missing: its beloved pastor, Father Gioacchino Basile. He died as a result of coronavirus on April 4, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn.
""Father Gioacchino was loved by everyone -- everyone in the parish,"" parishioner Florence Soulama told CNN. ""We are heartbroken.""
""He is really a model priest for what we need at this time,"" she said.
This particular time is especially difficult for the St. Gabriel community. Elmhurst has been one of the hardest hit areas of New York City by coronavirus, with more than 764 confirmed cases according to New York City Health Department data. 
Elmhurst Hospital, a 15-minute drive from the parish, quickly became a symbol in the city's fight to control the virus, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying it has ""borne the brunt more than any other hospital in the city"" on April 5. 
Gioacchino was one of six members of the parish community to test positive for coronavirus, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn.
""Although we have been affected disproportionately as a community by the virus, it has also brought the parish together in a sense"" parishioner Angel Alcántara told CNN. ""These teachings that Father Gioacchino has been giving us for all these years have prepared us for a situation like this.""
Gioacchino was an Italian immigrant, who parishioners say battled health concerns throughout his life. He was ordained in 1995 and was to celebrate his 25th anniversary in the priesthood this year. Almost half of his career was spent at St. Gabriel, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn. 
Gioacchino was a humble, loving priest that united the community of St. Gabriel, parishioners said -- a community reflective of Queens' reputation as New York's most diverse borough. 
When Gioacchino joined the parish, it was split evenly between English and Spanish speakers, according to Alcántara. 
Now, he says a majority of the community is Hispanic, with parishioners from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America. The English speakers hail from a number of different countries, too, with parishioners representing Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago to name a few. Gioacchino was able to unite them all, Alcántara said. 
""Father Gioacchino was effective in bringing all these different groups of parishioners together,"" Alcántara told CNN.
""It was something he was able to achieve, to work with always with God at the center,"" he said. 
Both Soulama and Alcántara said that Gioacchino had deep, lasting impacts on their lives. Soulama described that when she faced a difficult time in her life when her husband was sick, Gioacchino's homilies, which she listened to nearly every morning at daily Mass, brought her peace.
""There is nothing to worry about -- we just have to trust in the Lord, and then everything will be fine, "" she said of his message.
 ""We will overcome it knowing that it's God's will."" 
Separated but still united
This is the attitude that the parish community is bringing to this Easter season -- separated from each other because of social distancing during an especially challenging time. 
The parish community is uniting over Zoom, Skype and even praying together over the phone to celebrate this season. The parishioners will still sing hymns and will listen to readings but will not receive the Eucharist during Catholicism's most solemn holiday. 
""Obviously it's different, but the essence of it is still there,"" Alcántara told CNN, as he was helping to set up for the virtual Easter vigil to take place Saturday evening.
""Even though the doors are locked, people still call each other, pray over the phone,"" Soulama said. ""And we learned that from Father Gioacchino.""
The parishioners are sure that Gioacchino continues to pray for them in heaven. Soulama, who would help set up the church for Mass, shared a message he would tell the family at funerals. 
""He always said to them, Nnever say goodbye, just say see you,' "" Soualama said.
And she also shared the message Gioacchino would give at the end of the funeral Mass.
""He would say, 'That's what your loved one wants right now -- for you to love one another,' "" Soualama said."

""If you get an extraordinary viral disease that will damage your lungs, you need a heart that can work with how your body responds to the virus,"" said Dr. Maria Carolina Delgado-Lelievre, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. 
But for those with hypertension, ""Covid will cause a systemic reaction in the body in a patient that already has risk"" because of poor heart health, she said. That means the virus can attack multiple organ systems.
The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report fromFebruary 12 toMarch 28showed that 9% of Covid-19 patients in the United Statesalso self-reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.
High blood pressure is the most common type of heart disease and affects almost half of all American adults, according to the CDC. That's about 108 million Americans living with the condition. 
And because hypertension is more common as people grow older, thatmeans many of the same people with high blood pressure already overlap with the elderly populations
 known to be at higher risk for contracting Covid-19.
Recognize the warning signs and know how to take your blood pressure
At a basic anatomic level, hypertension happens when there's an abnormality in blood vessels that can impair the way oxygen is transferred to the cells.
Having a low blood oxygen level is common among those hospitalized with Covid-19, according to a study of patients in Wuhan, China published in the Lancet in January.
""High blood pressure is not [just]a number. The number is a guide, it's a symbol,"" Delgado-Lelievre said. ""It's telling us your vessels all over the body are not working as they should.""
High blood pressure may not come with noticeable symptoms, so the best way to identify it is to simply do a blood pressure reading.
To do that, first make sure you have a blood pressure cuff. Today's technology is accurate enough that using a digital wrist cuff can get a good blood pressure reading, Delgado-Lelievre said. 
Next, rest in a sturdy chair for at least five minutes, making sure to sit with your back straight.Keep your forearms supported on a flat surface such as a table, and keep the blood pressure cuff placed directly above where your elbow bends. 
As you're monitoring blood pressure over time, make sure to take the readings at the same time every day.
Any blood pressure reading of 120 over 80 is considered elevated, Delgado-Lelievre said.
Moving up from that point, the first level of hypertension is defined as 130 or higher for systolic (the top number) and 80 or higher for diastolic (the lower number), according to the American Heart Association.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep taking your medicine 
During the pandemic, the best way those with hypertension can manage their own risk is to follow the same guidelines as everyone else:maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and refrain from touching one's face.
More specific to high blood pressure, it's important to try to relax as much as possible, as stress commonly drives up readings. 
With so much of society upended by social distancing and the threat of more infections, relaxing is obviously easier said than done. But do as well as you can to try to keepyour blood pressure at a healthy level.
Although hypertension is a genetic disease, it has external drivers such as lifestyle, diet and exercise.
Delgado-Lelievre said she often tells patients that if they come up with an unusually high blood pressure reading they should try relaxation exercises, or lie down and listen to music. Then they should take their blood pressure again, and they will likely see a drop.
""Some people already know they have hypertension and know they need to monitor their blood pressure two or three times a week,"" she added.
And despite some recent rumors to the contrary, doctors still recommend taking medications your doctor may have prescribed for blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the American Heart Association says.
""Do not stop your medications unless your doctor tells you to,"" Delgado-Lelievre said.
The African American community is at higher risk
It's not just adults over 60; African Americans are also at a higher risk for hypertension, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. 
US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" that he has high blood pressure, noting ""I have heart disease, and I and many black Americans are at higher risk for Covid,"" he said. 
CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Adams. 
""All the doctors are saying: people who have high blood pressure and hypertension are very at risk to dying when they get this virus,"" Jones said. ""Nobody is saying that to the black community loudly enough.""
For groups more likely to have co-morbid conditions or other risk factors, including African Americans and the elderly, Jones had blunt advice. 
""What that means is if your grandmother has high blood pressure or diabetes, grab her and pull her into the house and do not let her out for two months,"" he said.
""Those with hypertension have to be very cautious about maintaining the quarantine,"" Delgado-Lelievre added."

This is causing problems because again, thanks to COVID-19 the number of computers currently available for purchase is much lower than normal.
A number of factors are feeding the issue. Slower port inspections mean longer stock cycles. The United States Postal Service has suffered unprecedented slowdowns. Chinese factory production is pushing back up to pre-pandemic levels, but there are supply chain weaknesses that havent been fully addressed. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war isnt helping anything move faster, either. All told, Dell, HP, and Lenovo are claiming they have a collective shortage of 5 million laptops.
SEE ALSO: NYU students use TikTok to expose the school's bleak quarantine meal plan
Thats a hard place for kids and teachers to be in. A limited supply will drive up prices, exacerbating the digital divide at the worst possible time. Tom Baumgarten, superintendent of the Morongo Unified School District, had ordered 5,000 Lenovo Chromebooks when he was told they were banned due to the inclusion of a specific component. 
He switched his order to HP and was told to expect the machines by Aug 26. As of now, theyll arrive in October. As manufacturers come back online in China, theyve been prioritizing corporate and government orders above school production.
The Commerce Department has imposed restrictions on who U.S. companies can do business with based on human rights violations in China. The various Chinese companies added to the list are accused of being complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in Chinas campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
The fallout from this policy change is going to exacerbate an already tenuous situation for many children this year. Schools and the communities they serve have options, including fundraisers, recycling/repair parties that update and improve old hardware so it can serve this kind of task, and, of course, eBay. The competition for these resources, however, is going to be fierce.
What would be great is to see one of the major OEMs or chip manufacturers get involved with this directly. Dell, HP, and Lenovo all accept recycled PCs. Funnel the useful PCs into the educational market, specifically, and sell them at good prices. It wouldnt be enough to eliminate the problem, but it might help close the gap.
I thought about starting this paragraph by saying If youve got some spare hardware, but lets be honest with each other. You read ExtremeTech. Your spare hardware might be a five-year-old video card or a 2GB stick of DDR3, but youve probably got something somewhere. In some cases, even desktops with a USB camera would be preferable to nothing at all. In my experience, school districts will often gladly accept needed tech donations, even if they havent put out a specific call to the community. If you choose to go this route, be straightforward, get the principal or IT guy on the phone, and ask what kind of equipment they need.
True, were not going to solve this shortage by digging lost hardware out of the couch cushions (Im not talking about this). If companies and communities work together to recycle some of the hardware collectively stuck in storage closets, basements, and attics across the country, we might be able to make a dent.

Sydney (CNN) An empty airport. A plane that usually holds over 300 people, taking off with just a few dozen passengers.
Officials covered head to toe in protective medical gear. Military escorts and a bus to a luxury hotel. As the door closes, the realization that it's forbidden to leave this space for the next 14 days. 
Once upon a time, this would be the scene from a Hollywood sci-fi movie. Today, it's the experience that awaits most travelers who fly into Australia -- myself, an Australian citizen, included.
Hong Kong to Sydney for a final goodbye
I had to return home for a family funeral. 
My father-in-law was diagnosed with terminal cancer in October 2018. When Covid-19 hit in March this year and borders began closing, my wife and baby moved from our home in Hong Kong back to Australia as he didn't have long to live.
He lost his fight for life on July 17 before I could join them. There was no exemption from Australia's strict quarantine rules to allow me to say my final goodbyes, but I decided to go anyway to attend his funeral and support my family, who agreed to postpone the service till I was out of quarantine. 
A surreal experience awaits international fliers
I left via Hong Kong Airport just 24 hours after his death. The global aviation hub was a shell of its normally bustling self. 
The concourses were empty, flashy restaurants and shops closed and passengers scarce in what's normally one of the most transited airports in the region.
Boarding a flight with fewer than 70 people -- all masked -- was even more surreal. 
As the 8.5-hour flight began to descend, Australia emerged from below, looking as beautiful as ever. Yet upon landing in Sydney, it became immediately clear little else was the same.
First, medical officials in PPE boarded the plane to hand out information leaflets. 
Eventually allowed to disembark, I walked through the deserted Sydney Airport terminal to be screened for a fever and was asked various questions about my health and travel history.
After waiting for hours with my bags, I was led by state police and military to an empty bus. No family or friends were waiting and my exact destination was unknown.
Luxury hotel doubles as quarantine facility
As it turned out, my quarantine home would be the InterContinental Hotel in Sydney's CBD Central Business District.
Sounds nice, right? In normal times it would be. The room will usually set travelers back around US$250 per night. 
But thankfully I wasn't required to pay for my stay as my flight was booked in March, well before the July 12 deadline for quarantine to be covered by state governments. Those who travel to New South Wales now have to pay 3,000 Australian dollars (about US$2,150) for their 14-day quarantine stay. 
Inside the hotel room, there was the usual mini bar, sweeping views of the city and its botanical gardens, as well as the busy streets below. Some rooms look across the famous harbor, the beauty of the Opera House and iconic Harbour Bridge on full display.
The day I landed was considered my ""Day Zero"" by officials, meaning day one didn't actually begin until midnight. So, one could even look at it as 15 days in quarantine. (It's probably best not to.)
On the following day I received a visit from a medical team, which performed a throat and nasal swab with tiny instruments that scratched at the back of my throat and up both nostrils.
Those who test positive receive a phone call and symptoms are monitored. On day 10, all guests undergo a second test.
Thankfully, my tests came back negative. 
Meals were delivered to my room three times a day. Based on what I saw in social media groups, I believe I ended up in one of the best possible spots -- many other quarantined travelers complained about the quality of their hotels.
But travelers have no choice in the matter. They only know which hotel they'll be placed in when the bus deposits them at the door.
Families are placed in larger serviced apartments -- when available -- and they are considered to be the fortunate ones as it means they usually get open windows or even balconies.
In my case, the desire for fresh air became overwhelming after the first few days.
So how did I pass the days locked in a 32-square-meter room?
A continental breakfast arrived at 7 a.m., allowing me to have a morning video chat with family over coffee and cereal.
Then I had a morning workout in a small area I set up for myself.
At some point I'd receive a daily call from one of the nurses, checking that all was OK. Some offered a chat, others just asked the routine questions and hung up. It's possibly the only human contact some quarantined arrivals may have the whole day.
One nurse seemed shocked when I asked how she was doing. It was obviously taking a toll on them, too.
After breakfast, I would often wash my clothes in the bathtub with some washing liquid I brought with me and hang them to dry. Then, I read the local paper. By this time, lunch had arrived -- either a sandwich or salad.
Afternoons were spent reading, working and watching TV, though occasionally the boredom got to me and I found myself making puppets out of paper plates.
Dinner varied but was always warm. After an evening chat with the family, I usually watched more television and then headed to bed.
I could order groceries or restaurant deliveries; the goods were left at the hotel front desk and then brought to the door. Care packages were allowed, too. 
Alcohol was limited to either a six-pack of beer or a bottle of wine per day.
The mental effects of isolation
When you haven't seen your family for almost five months and lose a loved one to terminal cancer, coming this far and being so close but still shut off from them -- well, it doesn't do nice things to your head. 
As a photojournalist I have been in worse situations.
Breaking news sometimes means going days without ample food, water and safe living conditions, all while being surrounded by death -- so I feel I was mentally more prepared for this experience than many.
Nonetheless, it was when I'd try to fall asleep that my mind raced. Mainly I thought about my family and how many days I had left. After five months of separation from my one-year-old daughter, I wondered what it would be like when I saw her face to face again.
Australians struggle to return home
I moved to London in 2005, a naïve 23-year-old Aussie. 
My first time on a plane was the day I left Sydney's golden beaches for the grey skies of the United Kingdom, following the pilgrimage that many of my fellow Australians have enjoyed for decades before. 
Though estimates vary, it's believed there are anywhere from 300,000 to a million of us living outside Australia's borders.
I stayed in London for almost 10 years, became a dual citizen then moved to Hong Kong, continuing my employment with CNN.
In all that time I flew the Australian flag proud, happy to talk about where I had come from, enjoying the reputation we have always held in other countries: Hard-working larrikins who love to travel and take pride in our identity.
But the harsh fact is that with flight cancellations, mandatory hotel quarantines, denied government exemptions and a public backlash against returning Australians, the situation has made it almost impossible for some to return right now, leaving them to feel that the government has closed its doors.
Australia has imposed some of the world's harshest border rules. On March 18, it banned Australians from leaving the country. Two days later, it closed its borders to everyone who isn't a citizen or a resident. 
An influx of overseas nationals have been scrambling to get home ever since.
But caps placed on international arrivals mean only 4,000 are allowed in each week. No more than 350 people can land in Sydney each day.
In reality, it's not possible for most of us to just to leave it all behind in an instant. We reside in another country. We have jobs, friends, children in schools and have set up a way of life in all of these foreign destinations.
More than 90% of new Covid-19 cases in Australia's state of Victoria can be traced back to one quarantine hotel, officials say. The state has launched a judicial inquiry into what went wrong in the quarantine hotels that helped unleash a fresh outbreak in the state. CNN's Will Ripley reports. 
Many who have chosen to head back home for whatever reason are now stuck abroad thanks to canceled flights, extortionate airfares and no housing options. 
And, if they do make it, they're charged for government enforced quarantine that could see a family of four who arrive in Sydney pay over US$3,500 for 14 days.
Back in Hong Kong, another quarantine stint awaits
Now that the funeral is over, I'll soon have to return to Hong Kong, where I'll face another two weeks of home quarantine before I can get back to my life, job and friends abroad.
I will always recognize myself as an Australian. I was blessed to be born, raised, educated and loved in this country. 
One day I will return for good, hopefully under better conditions.
But for now, the future is uncertain and continuing my life overseas is a tough decision that I know I'm not alone in having to make."

The feature addition follows the announcement of Spotify’s COVID-19 Music Relief project, which will see the company match donations dollar-for-dollar (up to a maximum of $10 million) to a group of verified organizations that are offering financial relief to artists and industry professional. How much the company’s latest feature will help musicians will depend on how much money people can afford to donate.

Because of all that, search results on the App Store show few apps related to the virus. The top result is a Brazilian government app about the outbreak, along with a wallpaper app, a Plague Inc-like game, an app from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a COVID-19 information app published by a medical developer.
A search on Google Play, by contrast, shows ""no results found for 'coronavirus',"" with the same message on a search for COVID-19. Google has yet to comment (we've reached out), but does have policies against apps that ""lack reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic events"" or ""profit from a tragic event with no discernible benefit to the victims.""
Google did publish a website called ""Coronavirus: Stay informed,"" with a list including apps from the Red Cross, Center for Disease Control (CDC) news organizations and Twitter(!). However, that page doesn't come up in a Play Store search for coronavirus.
Google doesn't seem to be completely banning independent apps with coronavirus info, CNBC notes. A top Android app called Corona 100m that maps COVID-19 (the diseased caused by the coronavirus) in South Korea is still available, for example.
Technology companies have been fairly proactive about fighting coronavirus misinformation. Facebook and Google are removing false coronavirus content (including bogus cures), and Facebooks is running free WHO ads to counter inaccuracies. Twitter has also banned coronavirus misinformation and Pinterest created a custom search experience to ensure users get reliable information. However, scams, cures and gouging still abound. Amazon in particular is trying to stay on top of product listings that claim to provide coronavirus cures, or are massively overcharging for hand sanitizer, face masks and other health-related items."

“The production capability and capacity of biotech companies in the world is, we know, limited, and global supply chains also have challenges,” Ali Ghufron Mukti, head of the innovation team at Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, told a streamed press conference alongside the country’s foreign minister. 
“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” he said. 
“We are using our theory and we are optimistic that in the year 2021 and early 2021, this will be finished in the laboratory,” he said, adding state-owned firm Bio Farma could conduct trials in the second half of next year. 
Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi has in recent months spoken about the need for developing countries to have access to any future vaccine, amid concern that rich countries would try to corner a limited supply. 
Such concerns increased this week, when the United States announced it had bought up most of the global supply of Gilead Sciences Inc.’s drug remdesivir, shown to speed up recovery times from COVID-19. 
The pandemic has sparked a race to find a vaccine, with more than 100 in development and around a dozen already being tested in humans. 
On Thursday, Mukti also outlined efforts underway between local and foreign pharmaecutical companies to mass produce a vaccine in Indonesia. A COVID-19 Vaccine Development Team has been tasked with guaranteeing the availability of a vaccine nationally within the next 12 months. 
Honesti Basyir, the director of Bio Farma, told Reuters in late June it was working with Chinese firm Sinovac on a vaccine which would enter the third phase of clinical trials in humans this month. If the trial is successful, it could start production in the first quarter of next year with a minimum 100 million doses. 
With a population of more than 265 million, Indonesia estimates it would need more than 352 million shots of a two-dose vaccine. 
On Thursday Indonesia recorded 1,624 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily rise so far, taking the total numbers of cases to 59,394.

“The production capability and capacity of biotech companies in the world is, we know, limited, and global supply chains also have challenges,” Ali Ghufron Mukti, head of the innovation team at Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, told a streamed press conference alongside the country’s foreign minister. 
“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” he said. 
“We are using our theory and we are optimistic that in the year 2021 and early 2021, this will be finished in the laboratory,” he said, adding state-owned firm Bio Farma could conduct trials in the second half of next year. 
Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi has in recent months spoken about the need for developing countries to have access to any future vaccine, amid concern that rich countries would try to corner a limited supply. 
Such concerns increased this week, when the United States announced it had bought up most of the global supply of Gilead Sciences Inc.’s drug remdesivir, shown to speed up recovery times from COVID-19. 
The pandemic has sparked a race to find a vaccine, with more than 100 in development and around a dozen already being tested in humans. 
On Thursday, Mukti also outlined efforts underway between local and foreign pharmaecutical companies to mass produce a vaccine in Indonesia. A COVID-19 Vaccine Development Team has been tasked with guaranteeing the availability of a vaccine nationally within the next 12 months. 
Honesti Basyir, the director of Bio Farma, told Reuters in late June it was working with Chinese firm Sinovac on a vaccine which would enter the third phase of clinical trials in humans this month. If the trial is successful, it could start production in the first quarter of next year with a minimum 100 million doses. 
With a population of more than 265 million, Indonesia estimates it would need more than 352 million shots of a two-dose vaccine. 
On Thursday Indonesia recorded 1,624 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily rise so far, taking the total numbers of cases to 59,394. 
In addition to Bio Farma and Sinovac, Mukti said private Indonesian pharmaceutical firm Kalbe Farma and the South Korean biotech company Genexine were cooperating to produce a vaccine.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson first eased England’s lockdown on June 1, and has since re-opened more of the economy. 
The research showed the rates of infection fell during May, the last month of full lockdown, halving every eight to nine days. 
The study - which is a “pre-print”, meaning it has yet to be peer-reviewed - found there were on average 13 positive cases for every 10,000 people, with an overall reproduction number of 0.57. 
That is lower than the government’s official figures for that time, estimating a so-called “R” number of 0.7-0.9 when lockdown was eased. An R number of less than 1 indicates an epidemic is shrinking. 
“Our level of adherence in the UK, and the overall average behaviour was very effective at reducing transmission of the virus,” Steven Riley, Professor of Infectious Disease Dynamics, Imperial College London, told reporters. 
Over 120,000 volunteers were tested as part of the study, which health minister Matt Hancock said showed the government took the “right actions at the right time”. 
The research also found that young adults were more likely to test positive than other age groups, indicating the need for them to follow social distancing even if their symptoms are often less severe than for older people. 
It also said that people of Asian ethnicity were more likely to test positive, which might account for higher death rates in that group. 
A separate pre-print study of a pilot test-and-trace scheme on the Isle of Wight found that it had reduced total incidence of infections and the R number faster than in other areas of the UK.

A 25-year-old resident of Reno, Nevada was infected with the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, two times, about 48-days apart, with the second infection causing a more severe case of COVID-19 than the first and requiring hospitalization and oxygen support.
Thats according to a draft study, led by researchers at the University of Nevada and posted online. The study has not been published by a scientific journal and has not been peer-reviewed. Still, it drew quick attention from researchers, who have been examining data from the first confirmed case of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, reported earlier this week.
Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are not surprisingor even necessarily concerning. From person to person, immune responses to an infection develop along a spectrum, with some people mounting robust, protective responses and others being left with weaker responses. Amid the more than 24.5 million cases worldwide, it is completely expected to find some recovered patients who are not completely protected by their immune responses and are thus vulnerable to reinfection.
The big question is: how common is this scenario? Researchers still do not know. This case may very well represent a very rare event, but there are many massive questions about SARS-CoV-2 immune responses that researchers are racing to understand. Why do some people develop more severe disease than others? For those who recover, what levels of immune responses will protect them from another infection? How many of the recovered will develop those protective responses? And how long do those protective responses last?
While the new report of a reinfection is an important data point, itlike the reinfection report before itdoes not answer any of these big questions.
Genetic detective work
About all we can say from these reports is that reinfection is possibleat least for some individuals. Again, this isnt surprising, but it is tricky to prove. Like the report earlier this week, the Nevada researchers turned to whole genome sequencing as evidence that their patient did indeed have two, distinct infections.
Specifically, the researchers decoded the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material collected from nasal swabs taken during the first and second illness. The researchers found that viruses present in the patients nose during the two illnesses had many small differences in their codes. The first virus had four code variations missing from the secondand the second virus had seven variations missing from the first. While small genetic changes tend to naturally accumulate in viruses over time, the researchers calculated that if the two illnesses were actually caused by the same virus, the virus would have had to evolve more than 3.6-times faster in this one patient than has been previously documented. Moreover, four of the changes seen between the two viruses could only be explained by genetic reversions, and the odds of these occurring are vanishingly remote, the authors say.Still, aside from the genetic evidence suggesting two different infections, theres always the question of whether there was some mix-up with the samples. That is, perhaps the patient did not have the different strains of virus plucked from their nose; perhaps the swabs were simply mislabeled or mishandled in the lab. To try to head off this concern, the researchers did genetic forensic testing on the liquid in which the swabs were stored and intermediate sample preparations. The researchers found that all the human-derived material scraped up and associated with the nasal swab samples came from the same person.
Holes in immunity
While the researchers make a persuasive case that their patient was in fact infected twice, critical data about the patients immune responses are missing. Most notably, the researchers did not test for antibodies after the persons first infection in April, which was marked by sore throat, cough, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. So, although data so far suggests that most people develop antibodies that can help protect against SARS-CoV-2 after an infection, the researchers dont know if this patient did or not. They do note, however, that the patient was not immunocompromised and did not appear to have a condition that would make reinfection seem more likely.
In the first report of a reinfection in a Hong Kong man, researchers tested for antibodies at one point after the patient's first infection, but they didn't find any. Though this hints that the person may not have developed antibodies (which could explain the reinfection), the researchers say they would need more testing at different time points to definitely show a lack of antibodies after the first infection. Importantly, the Hong Kong patient's second bout of COVID-19 was asymptomatic, suggesting that he did have some protective immune responses.
The Nevada patient wasn't so lucky. In the second infection that began in late May, the patient developed shortness of breath and a cough. Lung scans later showed signs of atypical pneumonia. The person was hospitalized and required ongoing oxygen support. In early June, the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but the researchers did not closely examine the types of antibodies.
In all, this case, like the first, leaves all the big questions unanswered. As Yale immunology expert Akiko Iwasaki summarized: This case highlights the need for further examination of the range of outcomes from reinfection by COVID19. As more and more reinfection cases will be reported, we should get a better sense of how well the immune system after natural infection protects against disease."

Hong Kong man has first documented COVID-19 reinfection 
A 33-year-old man who had recovered from a severe case of COVID-19 in April was infected again four months later in the first documented instance of human reinfection, University of Hong Kong researchers said on Monday. In August, after returning from a trip to Europe, he was diagnosed again - but with a different strain of the virus. While the first infection landed him in the hospital, the second produced no symptoms. Genetically, the first virus was closely related to strains collected in March/April while the second was closely related to strains collected in July/August, the researchers wrote in a report seen by Reuters. ""Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses,"" they said in a statement. ""Since the immunity can be short lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection,"" researchers said. ""Patients with previous COVID-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing,"" they added. The report has been accepted for publication in Clinical Infectious Diseases. (bit.ly/34v5Lii; reut.rs/3l823Rv) 
Low oxygen in COVID-19 pneumonia linked to vascular widening 
Widened small blood vessels in the lungs appear to be linked with the low oxygen levels seen in COVID-19 respiratory failure, a small study suggests. Researchers made the discovery by injecting saline with tiny microbubbles into the veins of 18 critically ill COVID-19 patients and tracked the bubbles using ultrasound. Normally, the bubbles would travel through the heart and enter the lungs, but would not get through the lungs because they would not fit through the capillaries. In more than 80% of these patients, however, the bubbles passed through the lungs and reached the blood vessels of the brain, which means the lung's capillaries were abnormally dilated, researchers reported earlier this month in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The more bubbles that made their way beyond patients' lungs, the lower their oxygen levels, researchers said. This ""may explain the disproportionate low oxygen levels seen in many patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"" coauthor Dr. Hooman Poor of the Mount Sinai - National Jewish Health Respiratory Institute in New York City told Reuters. Researchers should consider testing drugs that would cause these patients' pulmonary blood vessels to constrict, he suggested. An editorial published in the journal on Friday points out that with dilated pulmonary blood vessels, a higher-than-usual volume of blood flows into the brain, which ""raises the question of whether increased neurologic complications of COVID-19 could be related"" to the dilation observed by the researchers.

Genetic “barcodes” may help monitor coronavirus mutations 
""Genetic barcodes"" can help track how the new coronavirus spreads and mutates, researchers said on Saturday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Based on the organization, or sequence, of the genetic code of the virus, the researchers identified 11 distinct SARS-CoV-2 ""barcodes"" that represent different clades, or lineages, descended from a common viral ancestor. ""We were able to assign approximately 94% of the global sequenced genomes to one of the clades,"" Arnab Pain of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia told Reuters. Different continents have different variations, his team found. The subtle differences in the genetic sequences represented by the barcodes may affect virus infectivity or illness severity, he noted. Most of the genetic profiles available for the study were from North America and Europe, with COVID-19 cases from other regions under-represented. The researchers plan to regularly update the barcodes. ""This is a dynamic process, and some virus clades/subclades may eventually die-off in the future, and new clades may form,"" Pain said. ""We will continue to monitor the viral mutations in the global scenario and share our observations with the scientific community."" (bit.ly/31mZVNK)

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings on Friday reported a 6% decline in sales for the nine-months to June 30, due to COVID-19-related trading restrictions imposed worldwide. 
Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, said sales from continuing operations for the period fell to 6.8 billion euros ($8.08 billion) from 7.2 billion euros in the same period the previous year. 
The retailer said while almost all of its stores had reopened by the end of June, a significant amount of trade had been lost while they were closed. 
“Since lockdown restrictions began to be lifted from early May, revenues are trending back to, and in some cases above, pre-COVID-19 levels,” the retailer said, 
Its cash position from operations at the end of the period was better than what it had estimated at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Sales at Pepkor Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary based in South Africa, fell 10% while sales of furniture retailer Conforama and Greenlit Brands, a household goods retailer and manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, declined 18% and 1% respectively. 
Pepco Group, another subsidiary which owns British discount retailer Poundland, was the only retailer to lift sales by 2% as revenue recovered when restrictions were eased. 
Steinhoff said Poundland continued to reduce its property costs by renegotiating 100 store leases during the period. 
Plans to possibly list its Australian Fantastic Group retailer remain in the early stages, with no definitive decision taken yet, the retailer said.

Despite lousy working conditions and chronic shoulder pain - it takes heft to manoeuvre the bus doors at speed - the nine-year-old lines up in hope of any driver offering him a shift. 
All for 100 birr ($2.78) a day. 
But since April, when Ethiopia ordered operators to cut passenger numbers to curb the new coronavirus, it has become increasingly hard for the child conductors to make ends meet. 
“Life is not comfortable. I spend my earnings within a day and when there is no work, I starve,” Tarekegn told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Tarekegn, who left his village in southern Ethiopia when all schools shut in March, is one of countless migrant boys working as minibus assistants in cities across Ethiopia. 
Locally known as ‘weyala’ or ‘redat’, they are a feature of every cityscape - yelling destinations at crowds of queuing commuters, then squeezing themselves into the blue and white buses to collect as many fares as possible. 
The pandemic has left such informal sector workers, often children like Tarekegn, more vulnerable as their income drops even as work exposes them to COVID-19, said academics. 
“They do not have the luxury of staying at home and reducing activities since these are necessary for survival,” said Alula Pankhurst, Ethiopia country director of Young Lives, an international study of childhood poverty. 
Ethiopia has recorded more than 45,220 coronavirus cases and 725 deaths. Experts say the crisis has made precarious jobs worse, as people can be more suspicious of marginalised communities for fear of catching the virus. 
“The risks they face - including from theft, beating, accidents and health - may well be heightened under COVID-19,” Alula said. 
The ministry of transport did not reply to requests for comment on the child conductors. 
TOO YOUNG 
Despite rapid economic growth in the past decade, inequality is stark in Ethiopia as a growing number of children migrate from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities, driven by poverty, neglect or the influence of peers, charities said. 
It is common to see children working on minibuses, as peddlers, shining shoes and selling lottery tickets, as child labour is deeply ingrained in daily life, according to Girmachew Adugna, a child migration specialist. 
More than 150 million children are engaged in child labour globally with about half carrying out dangerous work in sectors such as construction, agriculture, mining and manufacturing. 
Ethiopia has ratified key international conventions on child labour, but 42.7% of Ethiopian boys and girls aged from five to 17 work, according to a 2015 national survey. 
“Poverty is key here as many parents urge their children to engage in work, raise income for the family. This could be at the expense of the children’s well-being,” Girmachew said, describing migration as a “household strategy”. 
LESSER OF TWO EVILS 
There is no data on the number of boys who work on the estimated 6,000 minibuses operating in Addis Ababa, and their risky lifestyle has never before come on the radar, said Anania Admasu, director of children’s charity CHADET. 
“When the problem is huge, people don’t want to touch it,” Anania told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Conductors say confrontation with passengers is a hazard of the job and even the promised earnings depend on a driver’s good faith, said academics. 
Takele Begene said some of his fellow drivers had opted to do the job themselves - to make up for lower passenger numbers - so some boys now had to beg at restaurants for leftovers. 
Abebaw Kassa, coordinator of the Addis Ababa minibus taxi drivers’ association, said the group lobbied for assistants and had also urged drivers to continue hiring despite the crisis. 
“We believe these kids should go to school instead (but labour) is the lesser of two evils ... We are saving them from a lot of addictions,” he said, citing the dangers of street life. 
“While working as assistants, they can make money. Their life can be changed for the better,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, saying some even save enough to get a driving permit and work their way up the social ladder. 
But Tarekegn says he would far rather go home, that he feels tired of living hand to mouth. 
“I will stay here until I get (enough) money,” Tarekegn said. “Life is better in the countryside.

President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the scheme, worth up to 200 billion rand, in April under stimulus measures to lessen the pandemic’s impact on South Africa’s already shrinking economy. It had to be tweaked in July due to low take-up. 
But BASA said on Friday demand for the scheme is expected to remain at only a small fraction of the amount on offer and taper off, with companies averse to taking on more debt during the crisis and opting for other measures to manage its impact. 
“We are finally coming to some conclusions that, tentatively, looking at what we know so far, debt is not the only answer,” BASA managing director Bongiwe Kunene told reporters during a presentation. 
BASA said that even the “best possible case” for take-up by January was 43.7 billion rand. 
The scheme, launched in May, was meant to encourage banks to lend more, on more favourable terms, to businesses whose operations were thrown into disarray by the pandemic. 
Ongoing low take-up, despite measures to make it more attractive, will add to concerns that some 40% of a 500 billion rand stimulus package announced by Ramaphosa is not being put to work. 
Another factor in low take-up, according to BASA, was that the May launch of the scheme came after substantial relief provided by lenders already in the form of, for example, payment holidays, which also reduced demand.

By Tom Arnold 
LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable. 
With prime office blocks lying empty around the world, hotels half-vacant and retailers struggling to stay afloat, the funds are retreating from many of the real estate investments that have long been a mainstay of their strategies. 
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) invested $4.4 billion in the sector in the first seven months of 2020, 65% down from the same period a year ago, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by Global SWF, an industry data specialist. 
The nature of property investments is also shifting, with funds increasingly investing in logistics space, such as warehousing, amid a boom in online commerce during the pandemic, while cutting back on deals for offices and retail buildings. 
Such shifts in behaviour can have seismic effects on the global real estate market, given such funds are among the largest investors in property and have interests worth hundreds of billions of dollars in total. Three sovereign funds sit within the top 10 largest real estate investors, according to market specialists IPE Real Assets. 
A big question is whether the changes are structural for the funds, for which property is an asset-class staple at about 8% of their total portfolios on average, or a temporary response to a huge, unexpected and unfamiliar global event. 
“Real estate is still a big part of sovereign wealth fund portfolios and will continue to be so,” said Diego López, managing director of Global SWF and a former sovereign wealth fund adviser at PwC. 
“What COVID has accelerated is the sophistication of SWFs trying to build diversification and resilience into their portfolio - and hence looking for other asset classes and industries.” 
Sovereign funds have been more bearish on property than public pension funds, another big investor in the sector, Global SWF found. While they have outstripped the pension funds in overall investment across most industries and assets this year, by two to one, that ratio is reversed for real estate. 
FUTURE OF THE OFFICE 
Funds are nursing hits to their existing property portfolios stemming from the introduction of lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions. While other parts of their portfolio, such as stocks and bonds, have rebounded from March’s trough, a real-estate recovery is less assured. 
Property capital value globally is expected to drop by 14% in 2020 before rising by 3.4% in 2021, according to commercial real estate services group CBRE. Analysts and academics question whether the pandemic’s impact may prove long-lasting, with more people working from home and shopping online. 
“I think there’s a real threat to some commercial business districts in the big cities as I can’t see us all return to the 9-to-5 schlep in, schlep out,” said Yolande Barnes, a real-estate specialist at London university UCL. 
The value of property assets of some funds has fallen in 2020, with those experiencing the biggest drops including Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), according to data compiled for Reuters by industry tracker Preqin. 
Those four funds have collectively seen the value of such assets drop by $18.1 billion to $132.9 billion, the data showed. 
Reuters was unable to confirm whether the fall was due to lower valuations or asset sales. The funds either declined to comment or did not respond. 
Many sovereign funds do not publicly disclose data on property investments, with Norway’s one of the exceptions. 
The Norwegian fund, which has around $49 billion invested in real estate, up from $47 billion at the end of 2019, said last week its unlisted property portfolio returned minus 1.6% in the first half of 2020. 
Sovereign funds have also largely steered clear in 2020 of new direct investments in London or Los Angeles, hotspots in normal times, according to property services firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), which said SWFs were “on the defensive”. 
LOGISTICS AND BIOTECH 
The funds’ advance in logistics properties, such as warehousing and goods distribution centres, comes at a time of high demand as people have bought everything from toilet paper to trainers from home during lockdowns. 
So far this year, logistics have accounted for about 22% of funds’ real-estate investments by value, compared with 15% in 2019 as a whole, the Global SWF data shows. 
Meanwhile, investments in offices have fallen to 36% from 49% last year, and in retail property to zero versus 15%. 
Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer at the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC), told Reuters that real-estate deal volumes had “slowed down substantially” in general, but that, anecdotally, he saw activity in industrial facilities like logistics and “multi-family” apartment blocks. 
The wealth fund’s holdings have risen to $4.7 billion, up from $4 billion at the end of June, after the purchase of multi-family and industrial REIT stocks on July 1, Frampton said. 
“Commercial warehouse activity is strong,” he added. 
In a sign of the times, Temasek participated in a $500 million investment in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia in June. 
In contrast, physical retail, a significant part of many funds’ holdings, has been hit hard. QIA-owned luxury retailer Harrods in London has reportedly forecast a 45% plunge in annual sales, as visitor numbers plummet. Many other retailers have sought to renegotiate rents. 
The outlook appears brighter for some fledgling sectors such as biotech, which has come to the fore during the pandemic. 
“We have seen significant demand for life sciences space. That’s ranged from office to specialist lab and warehouse space,” said Alistair Meadows, JLL’s head of UK capital markets. 
DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES 
The U.S. office market is expected to face its first year since 2009 of more space becoming vacant than leased, according to CBRE. 
Still, investors are betting on a rebound of sorts in some quarters. For example, Canary Wharf Group, partly owned by the QIA, unveiled plans last month for a large new mixed-use development, including business space, in London’s financial district. 
And while hotels face huge challenges, occupancy rates are expected to rebound near to pre-COVID levels - but not until the end of 2021. 
The Libyan Investment Authority has experienced problems with the operating expenses of some of its properties, including some hotels in Africa owned by its subsidiary, Chairman Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed told Reuters. 
But it remains committed to its real-estate portfolio, estimated at $6.6 billion in its latest valuation in 2012, as it was able to restore its value, he said. 
Crises can also present opportunities, however. 
In the aftermath of the pandemic, some funds may look for bargains as distressed properties emerge. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which operates a fund, told Reuters it would “closely monitor market conditions with a view to capturing appropriate opportunities”. 
And in an uncertain world, some academics argue that property remains a solid bet for savvy investors. 
Barnes of UCL said sovereign funds could be “lighter on their feet” than some other institutional funds and more able to adjust their behaviour to suit changing circumstances. 
“Real estate is one of the better sectors to be in, in a world of turmoil,” she added. “But it’s very much about picking the right real estate.”

In Colombia, ambulances were blocked from entering a town to screen for COVID-19 cases, said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which recorded 611 incidents targeting health workers, patients and facilities from February to July. 
In South Africa, a testing station and a clinic were torched by people who did not want responders in their neighbourhood, said medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). 
“It’s a byproduct of the new, novel, infectious disease - there’s a lot of fear,” said Sean Christie, a spokesman for MSF in South Africa. 
“Even for areas that have experienced very big HIV and TB epidemics, this was just different. The media response was so overwhelming, and (there is) so much social media misinformation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Although governments and charities have launched information campaigns, more work is needed to address fake news, make sure people have access to the facts and include local communities in decision-making, aid workers said. 
Drawing on first-hand accounts and media reports, the ICRC said incidents, including physical attacks, verbal harassment and threats took place in more than 40 countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines. 
The real figure was likely much higher, the global humanitarian agency said. 
“Fear of contracting the disease and the lack of basic knowledge concerning COVID-19 are often the underlying reasons behind violent acts,” said Esperanza Martinez, the ICRC’s head of health. 
“To protect health care staff, medical facilities and patients from violence, it is of paramount importance to disseminate accurate information,” she said in a statement. 
Some of the most common beliefs are that coronavirus is man-made, that it is not real, or that new testing facilities or health centres will bring it to communities. 
Some people in Haiti believe hospital patients are given a deadly injection to increase the number of coronavirus deaths so that the government can attract more aid, according to one community leader. 
In Gambia, there have been no attacks but people are avoiding health facilities out of fear and trying to self-diagnose their illnesses, said Baba Balajo, a programme manager for the humanitarian agency Catholic Relief Services. 
“We have had people expressing the fear that nowadays, when you go to the health facilities you are always diagnosed with COVID,” he said. 
“It’s a problem because people now resort to going to pharmacies, and that may not resolve their health problems.”

More than 70,000 Venezuelans have gone home since April, some walking back for thousands of miles, according to the United Nations, after lockdowns, job losses and business closings brought an end to opportunities they sought elsewhere in Latin America. 
The political and economic turmoil in Venezuela, which the U.N. calls a humanitarian crisis, has prompted more than five million people to flee since 2014, many seeking refuge in neighboring Colombia, Peru and Chile. 
Upon their return, they face discrimination and are accused of being bioterrorists, said Jaime Lorenzo, head of Doctors United Venezuela in Caracas, in an online meeting held by the charity CARE. 
Returnees stopped at the border and people testing positive are typically required to quarantine, often in hotels or sports grounds where conditions are “inhumane,” he said. 
“We’ve been focused on trying to shatter this attempt to stigmatize a person who comes from another country ... and who is not to blame,” Lorenzo said. 
Doctors United Venezuela, a group of doctors and other health workers, has been critical of the government’s response to COVID-19 and of hospital conditions. 
Government-run hospitals have power outages and often lack water, protective gear and cleaning supplies, Lorenzo said. 
Health care workers were making their own cloth masks or reusing single-use face masks for up to two weeks, Lorenzo said. 
Nurses earn about $5 a month, and a junior doctor about $14 a month, which leaves them with no money after they pay for housing, food and transport, he said. 
“Doctors and health workers pay to go to work,” said Lorenzo, a veteran surgeon. 
Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment about the health care system and coronavirus response. 
According to government figures, about 280 Venezuelans have died of COVID-19 and about 35,000 people have been infected. 
Lorenzo said the government’s accounting of the coronavirus was differentiating between “imported cases” and “community transmission cases,” stigmatizing returning migrants. 
In a televised speech in July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blamed returning migrants using illegal footpaths across the border with Colombia for spreading COVID-19. 
“They are contaminating communities, they are killing their families,” Maduro said. 
In May, Lisandro Cabello, a regional government secretary, said returning migrants were “biological weapons” sent by Colombia to contaminate Venezuela.

BANGKOK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Thailand’s cabinet on Tuesday approved a 214 billion baht ($6.87 billion) borrowing plan for a revenue shortfall in the current fiscal year to September, due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, a government official said. 
The borrowing is part of an adjusted debt management plan which now sees net new debt of about 1.66 trillion baht, up from about 1.5 trillion baht, plus some debt reductions, deputy government spokeswoman Rachada Dhnadirek told a briefing. 
The government removed the debt of Thai Airways from the public debt plan as the carrier is no longer a state enterprise, she said. 
With the new plan, the outstanding public debt will be 8.21 trillion baht, or 51.64% of GDP, at the end of the current fiscal year to Sept. 30, Rachada said. 
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy contracted by 12.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the sharpest since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, as the outbreak hit tourism and domestic activity. 
The finance ministry earlier said the government’s net revenue collection in the first eight months of the fiscal year (October-May) was 1.5 trillion baht, or 11.2% below target, due to the outbreak impact and tax relief measures. 
The cabinet also approved soft loans worth 114 billion baht to support small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals, finance ministry official Lavaron Sangsnit said in a statement. 
“Although the government has introduced relief measures to mitigate the outbreak impact, some SME operators and groups of people still have no access to funding,” he said. 
The government has introduced a 1.9 trillion baht ($61.19 billion) package to mitigate the outbreak impact but the drawdown has been slow.

At a four-day virtual board meeting ending late Friday, the fund added Afghanistan and Sudan to a list of more than 100 countries receiving a total of $6.2 billion to reduce planet-heating emissions and enhance climate resilience. 
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was set up under U.N. climate talks in 2010 to help developing nations tackle global warming, and started allocating money in 2015. 
Executive Director Yannick Glemarec said the fund had “a key role to play to maintain climate ambition in the era of COVID-19” and would aim to improve the speed and efficiency of its response to developing country needs. 
Board co-chair Nauman Bashir Bhatti, from Pakistan, said climate finance would be crucial for recovery from the pandemic and the fund needed to increase support “even during these difficult times”. 
Those promises came as small island states criticised the pace and size of GCF assistance, saying they were now struggling with the economic blow from the pandemic on top of climate change impacts such as rising seas and stronger storms. 
Fiji’s U.N. Ambassador Satyendra Prasad said COVID-19 risked worsening the already high debt burden of small island nations, as tourism dived. 
“The importance of the (GCF) ... in accelerating transformative climate action in this present decade cannot be understated,” he added. 
He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation island nations were struggling to access other sources of finance and urged the GCF to boost aid to help them prepare project proposals and to release funding for approved projects faster. 
The Alliance of Small Island States said its members represented less than 10% of total funding requests. 
JOB CREATION 
The GCF this week approved three new projects for island nations, including strengthening buildings to withstand hurricanes in Antigua and Barbuda, and installing solar power systems on farmland on Fiji’s Ovalau island. 
It also gave the green light to payments rewarding reductions in deforestation in Colombia and Indonesia between 2014 and 2016. 
But more than 80 green groups issued an open letter ahead of the meeting opposing such funding. 
They said deforestation had since spiked and countries should not be rewarded for “paper reductions” in carbon emissions calculated from favourable baselines. 
Liane Schalatek, who leads climate finance work for the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America, said the fund should take a hard look at whether the forest emission reductions it is paying for would be permanent. 
It should also ensure the funding protects and benefits forest communities and indigenous people, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Other new projects included one for zero-deforestation cocoa production in Ivory Coast, providing rural villages in Senegal and Afghanistan with solar mini-grids, and conserving biodiversity on Indian Ocean islands. 
The fund said initiatives like these would create jobs and support a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis. 
The board also accepted Senegal’s La Banque Agricole and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization as partners that can implement projects with fund money. 
But Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) put its accreditation application on hold after campaigners argued the GCF should not work with a company that lends to developers of coal-power plants, though it has ruled out backing new ones.

Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. drug developer Novavax Inc said on Monday it started a mid-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa, as the country experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. 
South Africa is the fifth worst affected country with 583,653 coronavirus cases and 11,677 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
“Because South Africa is experiencing a winter surge of COVID-19 disease, this important Phase 2b clinical trial has the potential to provide an early indication of efficacy,” Novavax research chief Gregory Glenn said. 
The trial of Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373, backed by a $15 million grant from Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was being conducted in two separate groups, one comprising 2,665 healthy volunteers and the other, 240 HIV-positive adults. 
Novavax expects its vaccine, once approved, would be supplied to South Africa through a deal signed earlier this year with the Serum Institute of India to develop and commercialize NVX-CoV2373. 
The vaccine candidate is one of nearly 30 globally being tested in human clinical trials. 
Early-stage data from a small clinical trial of the vaccine has shown that it produced high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, and the company aims to begin larger studies to obtain regulatory approvals as early as December. 
Novavax intends to begin Phase 2 of the small clinical trial in the United States and Australia in the near future and said it would include about 1,500 candidates. It also aims to begin Phase III as soon as late September. 
The U.S. government in July awarded Novavax $1.6 billion to cover testing its potential coronavirus vaccine in the United States and manufacturing with the aim of delivering a 100 million doses by January.

Being forced to look to older, more organic ways of survival can be a silver lining within the devastation of the pandemic, connecting communities with their history, they said in an online meeting held by the Organization of American States (OAS). 
Caribbean nations, so economically dependent on tourism, have seen a plunge in visitors due to lockdowns, closed borders and airport shutdowns throughout the region. 
The coronavirus lockdown is expected to cause a 6.2% contraction of the Caribbean economy in 2020, largely fueled by a stop in tourism, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
Caribbean countries have reported more than 120,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,000 deaths. 
“COVID has given us an opportunity to really evaluate ourselves,” said Uwahnie Martinez, a member of the Garifuna people, who are descended from Central American natives and shipwrecked African slaves. 
“We have been far removed from who we are and our culture, and this is the time we can actually look within and incorporate what our ancestors have left for us,” said Martinez, who runs and owns the Palmento Grove Garifuna EcoCultural &amp; Fishing Institute, an indigenous tourism business in Belize. 
“Given our livelihood of fishing and farming, we are actually reverting back to this. We are seeing more fishermen going out,” she said. “We are returning to our farming roots.” 
Faced with a decline in tourism revenue, Garifuna communities in southern Belize are raising chickens to feed their families or to sell and are growing herbal gardens for traditional medicine, she said. 
“I like the idea of going back to farming. I’m hearing that a lot from Caribbean countries,” said Kim Hurtault-Osborne, head of integral development at the OAS, which promotes regional business and tourism. 
Locals are returning to fishing for food, she said. 
Fewer than five people have died from COVID-19 in Belize. 
The return to cultural roots can empower communities and reduce their economic dependence on tourism led by big resorts “that don’t give a damn about us,” Martinez said. 
“Cultural tourism has so much to offer ... but we’re so much focused on just putting indigenous people out there as circus clowns, and that must stop,” she said. 
Indigenous tourism typically includes visits to Garifuna villages where visitors learn about the culture’s drum music and cassava bread-making traditions, Martinez said. 
In Guyana, on South America’s Caribbean coast, the government is working with indigenous communities so they can reopen their lodges and tourism businesses safely, said Carla James, who heads the government’s Guyana Tourism Authority. 
About two dozen COVID-19 deaths have been reported in Guyana. 
Local communities are getting free training on COVID-19 safety protocols, along with cleaning products, masks and other protective equipment, James said. 
Tours have been run virtually, and indigenous arts and crafts are being sold online during the pandemic, she said. 
Decisions are yet to be made about reopening to tourism, she said. 
“When the community decides that they are ready, when they are confident enough to host guests, that’s when they will reopen,” James said.

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 21 (Reuters) - South Africa’s confirmed COVID-19 cases have surpassed 600,000, the health ministry said on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July. 
Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent. 
The ministry said in a statement South Africa now had a total of 603,338 cases and 12,843 deaths - accounting for more than half of the continent’s cases and around 47% of its deaths, according to a Reuters tally of government and World Health Organization data. 
Africa’s most industrialised economy reported 3,398 new cases on Friday, compared with a peak of over 13,000 cases a day seen in July. 
“We believe that South Africa is in a way moving past the point of the peak of the pandemic, we believe we have gone beyond the inflection point,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday. 
The COVID-19 crisis has battered an economy already in recession and pushed millions of South Africans deeper into extreme poverty. 
The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But President Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance. (Reporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Sandra Maler and Rosalba O’Brien)"

Some people in Haiti believe hospital patients are given a deadly injection to increase the number of coronavirus deaths so that the government can attract more aid, according to one community leader. 
In Gambia, there have been no attacks but people are avoiding health facilities out of fear and trying to self-diagnose their illnesses, said Baba Balajo, a programme manager for the humanitarian agency Catholic Relief Services. 
“We have had people expressing the fear that nowadays, when you go to the health facilities you are always diagnosed with COVID,” he said. 
“It’s a problem because people now resort to going to pharmacies, and that may not resolve their health problems.”

It didn’t matter that she lived in a tiny shack with her mother, who single-handedly raised three children by washing clothes for 1,500 Kenyan shillings ($14) a week. 
With strong grades in English and chemistry, the determined teen aspired to finish her education and become a television presenter. She would buy a house for her mother and support her sister and baby brother through school. 
Now, four months pregnant, Anna sits on the edge of the bed of her one-room home in Nairobi’s sprawling informal settlement of Kibera, facing an uncertain future. 
“When my school closed because of the virus, I was at home doing nothing so I started going around with a man who was a friend and we had sex,” said Anna, whose named has been changed to protect her identity. 
“I missed my period and realised I was pregnant. Now I sit here all day thinking about how frustrated I am with my life. I feel like I have destroyed my future.” 
From rape and sexual exploitation to female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage and early pregnancy, COVID-19 has unleashed a myriad of “shadow pandemics” on girls across Africa, say child rights groups. 
Africa’s confirmed coronavirus caseload has reached almost 1.2 million cases, with more than 26,000 deaths, according to the Africa Union’s Centre for Disease Control. 
Low levels of testing in most nations mean infection rates are likely to be higher, say health experts, adding it is hard to determine when countries will reach a peak in transmission. 
School closures have left girls open to sexual violence from family, neighbours and community members; lockdown poverty has forced minors into transactional sex to buy basics, they add. 
Uncertain when schools will resume, desperate families have resorted to marrying off under-age daughters to ease expenses - with some girls undergoing FGM as part of traditional customs. 
Countries such as Kenya, Malawi and Ethiopia are reporting spikes in teen pregnancies and early marriages, raising fears many girls may not ever return to school - and jeopardising decades of work to reverse deep-rooted gender inequalities. 
“There are serious concerns about the shadow pandemics that have come with COVID-19 such as sexual and gender-based violence and teen pregnancies,” said Kate Maina-Vorley, country director for the children’s charity Plan International in Kenya. 
“There has to be a recognition that some of the gains made in terms of delivering for girls and their rights have been eroded, and if it is not deliberately addressed in a concerted manner, we will not be fit for purpose in a post-COVID world.” 
‘DIRE WEB OF VULNERABILITIES’ 
Women and girls across Africa face challenges in securing the most basic rights - from accessing education and health services to violence, forced marriage and early motherhood. 
The United Nations says 23% of girls on the continent are not in primary school against 19% of boys. Nearly four in 10 girls marry before turning 18, according to the World Bank. 
Africa also has the highest rates of early pregnancies in the world. In 2018, the estimated adolescent birth rate in West and Central Africa was 115 births per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19, compared to a global rate of 44 births. 
Child rights groups say fallout from the pandemic has further worsened girls’ lot - particularly the closure of schools, seen as safe spaces for children. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) says of 39 countries surveyed in sub-Saharan Africa, only six have fully reopened schools. In Kenya, the government has cancelled the entire school year, with a plan to resume in January. 
A report on Wednesday by Plan International and the African Child Policy Forum found school closures had forced more than 120 million girls across the region to stay home, many isolated and susceptible to abuse or peer-to-peer sex. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and added yet another layer of vulnerability to an already dire web of vulnerabilities of girls in the African continent,” said the report. 
“Millions of girls have been deprived of access to food, basic healthcare and protection and thousands exposed to abuse and exploitation.” 
There is no accurate data on the number of girls abused, but calls to helplines have surged in countries such as Tunisia, Niger, South Africa, Uganda, Malawi and Somalia. 
In Kenya, a national helpline supported by the department of gender affairs reported a more than 10-fold increase in calls - with 1,108 calls in the month of June compared to just 86 in February. Many were reports of child rape. 
With families unable to earn in lockdown, girls are married for a dowry or engage in transactional sex, exploited by neighbours, drivers or other locals - just to buy food. 
NO RETURN TO SCHOOL 
Campaigners in Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, Guinea and Burkina Faso fear hundreds of girls have also undergone FGM, with families taking advantage of lockdowns to prepare their daughters for marriage. 
Reports of adolescent pregnancies, child and forced marriages have also sky-rocketed. 
Authorities in Ethiopia have rescued more than 500 girls from child marriage since the pandemic shut its schools. 
In Malawi, helplines run by the charity YONECO reported a 350% rise in calls linked to child and forced marriages from March to May. 
Amos Zaindi, Malawi head for the charity CARE International, said the country was experiencing widespread child marriage before the pandemic, with about half of girls wed before 18. 
“Now with schools closed and increased poverty, the situation is getting worse,” said Zaindi in a statement. 
“As child marriage and pregnancy rise, girls will have an even harder time going back to school when it reopens, undoing precious gains in girls’ education.” 
Teen pregnancies and early marriage stifle a girl’s progress in education, health and employment, also hampering the development of her children, say health experts. 
A child bride is more likely to quit school, endure problems in pregnancy and childbirth and is at high risk of domestic violence. Her children are also lucky to survive beyond five. 
This also has economic consequences, says the World Bank, with African countries losing at least $60 billion in lifetime earnings - more than what the world gives the continent in aid annually. 
“It’s not just a problem about young girls, it’s a problem for the entire society,” said Ademola Olajide, country head of the U.N. Population Fund in Kenya. 
“Everyone will pay a price,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
The WHO and the U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, say school closures have helped keep children safe from the virus, but admit it harms them in other ways. 
The organisations are urging African governments to promote the safe reopening of schools, while taking measures to limit the spread of the virus - even as cases continue to climb. 
“The long-term impact of extending the school shutdown risks ever greater harm to children, their future and their communities,” Mohamed M. Malick Fall, UNICEF’s regional director for Eastern and Southern Africa, said in a statement. 
“When we balance the harm being done to children locked out of schools, and if we follow the evidence, it leads children back into the classroom.” 
But for girls like Anna, it may already be too late. 
""If the coronavirus did not happen, I would have been at school and not expecting a baby,"" she said. ""I would like to go back to school, but I don't know if it is possible.""

Sovereign funds rethink once-reliable real estate - Reuters India,The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable.,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-swf-realestate-insight-idINKBN25K0JC,https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200824&t=2&i=1530758516&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG7N0DG,2020-08-24T07:05:00Z,"LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable. 
With prime office blocks lying empty around the world, hotels half-vacant and retailers struggling to stay afloat, the funds are retreating from many of the real estate investments that have long been a mainstay of their strategies. 
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) invested $4.4 billion in the sector in the first seven months of 2020, 65% down from the same period a year ago, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by Global SWF, an industry data specialist. 
The nature of property investments is also shifting, with funds increasingly investing in logistics space, such as warehousing, amid a boom in online commerce during the pandemic, while cutting back on deals for offices and retail buildings. 
Such shifts in behaviour can have seismic effects on the global real estate market, given such funds are among the largest investors in property and have interests worth hundreds of billions of dollars in total. Three sovereign funds sit within the top 10 largest real estate investors, according to market specialists IPE Real Assets. 
A big question is whether the changes are structural for the funds, for which property is an asset-class staple at about 8% of their total portfolios on average, or a temporary response to a huge, unexpected and unfamiliar global event. 
“Real estate is still a big part of sovereign wealth fund portfolios and will continue to be so,” said Diego López, managing director of Global SWF and a former sovereign wealth fund adviser at PwC. 
“What COVID has accelerated is the sophistication of SWFs trying to build diversification and resilience into their portfolio - and hence looking for other asset classes and industries.” 
Sovereign funds have been more bearish on property than public pension funds, another big investor in the sector, Global SWF found. While they have outstripped the pension funds in overall investment across most industries and assets this year, by two to one, that ratio is reversed for real estate.

FUTURE OF THE OFFICE 
Funds are nursing hits to their existing property portfolios stemming from the introduction of lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions. While other parts of their portfolio, such as stocks and bonds, have rebounded from March’s trough, a real-estate recovery is less assured. 
Property capital value globally is expected to drop by 14% in 2020 before rising by 3.4% in 2021, according to commercial real estate services group CBRE. Analysts and academics question whether the pandemic’s impact may prove long-lasting, with more people working from home and shopping online. 
“I think there’s a real threat to some commercial business districts in the big cities as I can’t see us all return to the 9-to-5 schlep in, schlep out,” said Yolande Barnes, a real-estate specialist at London university UCL. 
The value of property assets of some funds has fallen in 2020, with those experiencing the biggest drops including Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), according to data compiled for Reuters by industry tracker Preqin. 
Those four funds have collectively seen the value of such assets drop by $18.1 billion to $132.9 billion, the data showed. 
Reuters was unable to confirm whether the fall was due to lower valuations or asset sales. The funds either declined to comment or did not respond. 
Many sovereign funds do not publicly disclose data on property investments, with Norway’s one of the exceptions. 
The Norwegian fund, which has around $49 billion invested in real estate, up from $47 billion at the end of 2019, said last week its unlisted property portfolio returned minus 1.6% in the first half of 2020. 
Sovereign funds have also largely steered clear in 2020 of new direct investments in London or Los Angeles, hotspots in normal times, according to property services firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), which said SWFs were “on the defensive”. 
LOGISTICS AND BIOTECH 
The funds’ advance in logistics properties, such as warehousing and goods distribution centres, comes at a time of high demand as people have bought everything from toilet paper to trainers from home during lockdowns. 
So far this year, logistics have accounted for about 22% of funds’ real-estate investments by value, compared with 15% in 2019 as a whole, the Global SWF data shows. 
Meanwhile, investments in offices have fallen to 36% from 49% last year, and in retail property to zero versus 15%. 
Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer at the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC), told Reuters that real-estate deal volumes had “slowed down substantially” in general, but that, anecdotally, he saw activity in industrial facilities like logistics and “multi-family” apartment blocks. 
The wealth fund’s holdings have risen to $4.7 billion, up from $4 billion at the end of June, after the purchase of multi-family and industrial REIT stocks on July 1, Frampton said. 
“Commercial warehouse activity is strong,” he added. 
In a sign of the times, Temasek participated in a $500 million investment in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia in June. 
In contrast, physical retail, a significant part of many funds’ holdings, has been hit hard. QIA-owned luxury retailer Harrods in London has reportedly forecast a 45% plunge in annual sales, as visitor numbers plummet. Many other retailers have sought to renegotiate rents. 
The outlook appears brighter for some fledgling sectors such as biotech, which has come to the fore during the pandemic. 
“We have seen significant demand for life sciences space. That’s ranged from office to specialist lab and warehouse space,” said Alistair Meadows, JLL’s head of UK capital markets.

DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES 
The U.S. office market is expected to face its first year since 2009 of more space becoming vacant than leased, according to CBRE. 
Still, investors are betting on a rebound of sorts in some quarters. For example, Canary Wharf Group, partly owned by the QIA, unveiled plans last month for a large new mixed-use development, including business space, in London’s financial district. 
And while hotels face huge challenges, occupancy rates are expected to rebound near to pre-COVID levels - but not until the end of 2021. 
The Libyan Investment Authority has experienced problems with the operating expenses of some of its properties, including some hotels in Africa owned by its subsidiary, Chairman Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed told Reuters. 
But it remains committed to its real-estate portfolio, estimated at $6.6 billion in its latest valuation in 2012, as it was able to restore its value, he said. 
Crises can also present opportunities, however. 
In the aftermath of the pandemic, some funds may look for bargains as distressed properties emerge. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which operates a fund, told Reuters it would “closely monitor market conditions with a view to capturing appropriate opportunities”. 
And in an uncertain world, some academics argue that property remains a solid bet for savvy investors. 
Barnes of UCL said sovereign funds could be “lighter on their feet” than some other institutional funds and more able to adjust their behaviour to suit changing circumstances. 
“Real estate is one of the better sectors to be in, in a world of turmoil,” she added. “But it’s very much about picking the right real estate.”

Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. drug developer Novavax Inc said on Monday it started a mid-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa, as the country experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. 
South Africa is the fifth worst affected country with 583,653 coronavirus cases and 11,677 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
“Because South Africa is experiencing a winter surge of COVID-19 disease, this important Phase 2b clinical trial has the potential to provide an early indication of efficacy,” Novavax research chief Gregory Glenn said. 
The trial of Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373, backed by a $15 million grant from Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was being conducted in two separate groups, one comprising 2,665 healthy volunteers and the other, 240 HIV-positive adults. 
Novavax expects its vaccine, once approved, would be supplied to South Africa through a deal signed earlier this year with the Serum Institute of India to develop and commercialize NVX-CoV2373. 
The vaccine candidate is one of nearly 30 globally being tested in human clinical trials. 
Early-stage data from a small clinical trial of the vaccine has shown that it produced high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, and the company aims to begin larger studies to obtain regulatory approvals as early as December. 
Novavax intends to begin Phase 2 of the small clinical trial in the United States and Australia in the near future and said it would include about 1,500 candidates. It also aims to begin Phase III as soon as late September. 
The U.S. government in July awarded Novavax $1.6 billion to cover testing its potential coronavirus vaccine in the United States and manufacturing with the aim of delivering a 100 million doses by January.

Despite lousy working conditions and chronic shoulder pain - it takes heft to manoeuvre the bus doors at speed - the nine-year-old lines up in hope of any driver offering him a shift. 
All for 100 birr ($2.78) a day. 
But since April, when Ethiopia ordered operators to cut passenger numbers to curb the new coronavirus, it has become increasingly hard for the child conductors to make ends meet. 
“Life is not comfortable. I spend my earnings within a day and when there is no work, I starve,” Tarekegn told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Tarekegn, who left his village in southern Ethiopia when all schools shut in March, is one of countless migrant boys working as minibus assistants in cities across Ethiopia. 
Locally known as ‘weyala’ or ‘redat’, they are a feature of every cityscape - yelling destinations at crowds of queuing commuters, then squeezing themselves into the blue and white buses to collect as many fares as possible. 
The pandemic has left such informal sector workers, often children like Tarekegn, more vulnerable as their income drops even as work exposes them to COVID-19, said academics. 
“They do not have the luxury of staying at home and reducing activities since these are necessary for survival,” said Alula Pankhurst, Ethiopia country director of Young Lives, an international study of childhood poverty. 
Ethiopia has recorded more than 45,220 coronavirus cases and 725 deaths. Experts say the crisis has made precarious jobs worse, as people can be more suspicious of marginalised communities for fear of catching the virus. 
“The risks they face - including from theft, beating, accidents and health - may well be heightened under COVID-19,” Alula said. 
The ministry of transport did not reply to requests for comment on the child conductors. 
TOO YOUNG 
Despite rapid economic growth in the past decade, inequality is stark in Ethiopia as a growing number of children migrate from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities, driven by poverty, neglect or the influence of peers, charities said. 
It is common to see children working on minibuses, as peddlers, shining shoes and selling lottery tickets, as child labour is deeply ingrained in daily life, according to Girmachew Adugna, a child migration specialist. 
More than 150 million children are engaged in child labour globally with about half carrying out dangerous work in sectors such as construction, agriculture, mining and manufacturing. 
Ethiopia has ratified key international conventions on child labour, but 42.7% of Ethiopian boys and girls aged from five to 17 work, according to a 2015 national survey. 
“Poverty is key here as many parents urge their children to engage in work, raise income for the family. This could be at the expense of the children’s well-being,” Girmachew said, describing migration as a “household strategy”. 
LESSER OF TWO EVILS 
There is no data on the number of boys who work on the estimated 6,000 minibuses operating in Addis Ababa, and their risky lifestyle has never before come on the radar, said Anania Admasu, director of children’s charity CHADET. 
“When the problem is huge, people don’t want to touch it,” Anania told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Conductors say confrontation with passengers is a hazard of the job and even the promised earnings depend on a driver’s good faith, said academics. 
Takele Begene said some of his fellow drivers had opted to do the job themselves - to make up for lower passenger numbers - so some boys now had to beg at restaurants for leftovers. 
Abebaw Kassa, coordinator of the Addis Ababa minibus taxi drivers’ association, said the group lobbied for assistants and had also urged drivers to continue hiring despite the crisis. 
“We believe these kids should go to school instead (but labour) is the lesser of two evils ... We are saving them from a lot of addictions,” he said, citing the dangers of street life. 
“While working as assistants, they can make money. Their life can be changed for the better,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, saying some even save enough to get a driving permit and work their way up the social ladder. 
But Tarekegn says he would far rather go home, that he feels tired of living hand to mouth. 
“I will stay here until I get (enough) money,” Tarekegn said. “Life is better in the countryside.

As lockdowns end, they urged governments to invest in catch-up programmes to prevent irretrievable damage to children’s futures. 
“We cannot stand by and allow these young people to be robbed of their education and a fair chance in life,” said the letter signed by 275 former world leaders, economists and educationalists. 
Signatories included former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former Irish president Mary Robinson, former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former British prime ministers Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major. 
Of particular concern are an estimated 30 million children who may never return to school despite lockdowns ending. 
“For these, the world’s least advantaged children, education is often the only escape from poverty - a route that is in danger of closing,” said the letter addressed to G20 heads, governments, the World Bank, IMF and development banks. 
“Many ... are adolescent girls for whom being in school is the best defence against forced marriage and the best hope for a life of expanded opportunity.” 
Worldwide, an estimated 12 million girls are wed every year before the age of 18 - nearly one girl every three seconds. 
U.N. experts have predicted the pandemic could lead to an extra 13 million child marriages over the next decade. here
The former leaders and economists said many other out-of-school children risked being forced into exploitative and dangerous labour. 
U.N. agencies say the number of child labourers worldwide has dropped to 152 million from 246 million in 2000, but fear the pandemic could spur the first uptick in child labour in 20 years as families struggle to survive the economic fallout. 
The former leaders warned that the education emergency would jeopardise global goals to end poverty and inequality by 2030 and could set back progress on gender equity by years. 
More than a billion children are still out of school because of lockdowns, the letter said. While many have benefited from e-learning, lack of internet access has left the poorest shut out of education. 
School closures have also increased hunger, with 300 million children losing free school meals. 
The former leaders warned that education spending in low and middle-income countries faced $100-150 billion in cuts. 
They urged G20 heads, national governments and global financial institutions to back an emergency plan including the protection of frontline national education budgets, debt relief for poor countries and increased multilateral aid. 
The letter also called for more support for online learning, personalised learning, teacher training, cash assistance for poor families, and safer schools that meet social distancing rules.

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Massmart expects its half-year loss to deepen by up to 42% because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the retailer said on Thursday, adding cost-savings were beginning to deliver results. 
Majority-owned by Walmart and operator of supermarkets and wholesalers, including Makro and Game, Massmart has seen operating costs from COVID-19 safety protocols reach 62 million rand ($3.60 million) so far this year, while other indirect pandemic-related costs added 13 million rand, it said in a statement. 
For the 26 weeks to June 28, Massmart’s total sales fell by 9.7% to 39.6 billion rand, with comparable store sales decreasing by the same amount. 
Its headline loss per share, the main profit measure in South Africa, for the period will widen to between 483.3 cents and 519.9 cents, worse than the year earlier loss of 366.6 cents, the company said. 
The carrying value of some store assets, as well as retrenchment costs following the closure of all of its electronic retail chain Dion Wired stores and 11 masscash stores, are expected to have a further negative impact. 
The masscash division comprises Jumbo cash and carry wholesaler, Cambridge Food and Rhino cash and carry stores. 
More positively, Massmart said cost savings are yielding results and expenses are growing less. 
“While sales have been lower than the same period last year, an increased focus on trading discipline and driving everyday low prices, while maintaining our competitive pricing gap has led to enhanced gross profit margin percentages,” it said. 
Its share price was almost unchanged, down 0.5% at 1220 GMT.

Sovereign funds rethink once-reliable real estate - Reuters,The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swf-realestate-insight-idUSKBN25K0JC,https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200824&t=2&i=1530751613&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG7N0DG,2020-08-24T06:10:00Z,"LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable. 
With prime office blocks lying empty around the world, hotels half-vacant and retailers struggling to stay afloat, the funds are retreating from many of the real estate investments that have long been a mainstay of their strategies. 
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) invested $4.4 billion in the sector in the first seven months of 2020, 65% down from the same period a year ago, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by Global SWF, an industry data specialist. 
The nature of property investments is also shifting, with funds increasingly investing in logistics space, such as warehousing, amid a boom in online commerce during the pandemic, while cutting back on deals for offices and retail buildings. 
Such shifts in behaviour can have seismic effects on the global real estate market, given such funds are among the largest investors in property and have interests worth hundreds of billions of dollars in total. Three sovereign funds sit within the top 10 largest real estate investors, according to market specialists IPE Real Assets. 
A big question is whether the changes are structural for the funds, for which property is an asset-class staple at about 8% of their total portfolios on average, or a temporary response to a huge, unexpected and unfamiliar global event. 
“Real estate is still a big part of sovereign wealth fund portfolios and will continue to be so,” said Diego López, managing director of Global SWF and a former sovereign wealth fund adviser at PwC. 
“What COVID has accelerated is the sophistication of SWFs trying to build diversification and resilience into their portfolio - and hence looking for other asset classes and industries.” 
Sovereign funds have been more bearish on property than public pension funds, another big investor in the sector, Global SWF found. While they have outstripped the pension funds in overall investment across most industries and assets this year, by two to one, that ratio is reversed for real estate.

FUTURE OF THE OFFICE 
Funds are nursing hits to their existing property portfolios stemming from the introduction of lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions. While other parts of their portfolio, such as stocks and bonds, have rebounded from March’s trough, a real-estate recovery is less assured. 
Property capital value globally is expected to drop by 14% in 2020 before rising by 3.4% in 2021, according to commercial real estate services group CBRE. Analysts and academics question whether the pandemic’s impact may prove long-lasting, with more people working from home and shopping online. 
“I think there’s a real threat to some commercial business districts in the big cities as I can’t see us all return to the 9-to-5 schlep in, schlep out,” said Yolande Barnes, a real-estate specialist at London university UCL. 
The value of property assets of some funds has fallen in 2020, with those experiencing the biggest drops including Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), according to data compiled for Reuters by industry tracker Preqin. 
Those four funds have collectively seen the value of such assets drop by $18.1 billion to $132.9 billion, the data showed. 
Reuters was unable to confirm whether the fall was due to lower valuations or asset sales. The funds either declined to comment or did not respond. 
Many sovereign funds do not publicly disclose data on property investments, with Norway’s one of the exceptions. 
The Norwegian fund, which has around $49 billion invested in real estate, up from $47 billion at the end of 2019, said last week its unlisted property portfolio returned minus 1.6% in the first half of 2020. 
Sovereign funds have also largely steered clear in 2020 of new direct investments in London or Los Angeles, hotspots in normal times, according to property services firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), which said SWFs were “on the defensive”. 
LOGISTICS AND BIOTECH 
The funds’ advance in logistics properties, such as warehousing and goods distribution centres, comes at a time of high demand as people have bought everything from toilet paper to trainers from home during lockdowns. 
So far this year, logistics have accounted for about 22% of funds’ real-estate investments by value, compared with 15% in 2019 as a whole, the Global SWF data shows. 
Meanwhile, investments in offices have fallen to 36% from 49% last year, and in retail property to zero versus 15%. 
Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer at the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC), told Reuters that real-estate deal volumes had “slowed down substantially” in general, but that, anecdotally, he saw activity in industrial facilities like logistics and “multi-family” apartment blocks. 
The wealth fund’s holdings have risen to $4.7 billion, up from $4 billion at the end of June, after the purchase of multi-family and industrial REIT stocks on July 1, Frampton said. 
“Commercial warehouse activity is strong,” he added. 
In a sign of the times, Temasek participated in a $500 million investment in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia in June. 
In contrast, physical retail, a significant part of many funds’ holdings, has been hit hard. QIA-owned luxury retailer Harrods in London has reportedly forecast a 45% plunge in annual sales, as visitor numbers plummet. Many other retailers have sought to renegotiate rents. 
The outlook appears brighter for some fledgling sectors such as biotech, which has come to the fore during the pandemic. 
“We have seen significant demand for life sciences space. That’s ranged from office to specialist lab and warehouse space,” said Alistair Meadows, JLL’s head of UK capital markets.

DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES 
The U.S. office market is expected to face its first year since 2009 of more space becoming vacant than leased, according to CBRE. 
Still, investors are betting on a rebound of sorts in some quarters. For example, Canary Wharf Group, partly owned by the QIA, unveiled plans last month for a large new mixed-use development, including business space, in London’s financial district. 
And while hotels face huge challenges, occupancy rates are expected to rebound near to pre-COVID levels - but not until the end of 2021. 
The Libyan Investment Authority has experienced problems with the operating expenses of some of its properties, including some hotels in Africa owned by its subsidiary, Chairman Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed told Reuters. 
But it remains committed to its real-estate portfolio, estimated at $6.6 billion in its latest valuation in 2012, as it was able to restore its value, he said. 
Crises can also present opportunities, however. 
In the aftermath of the pandemic, some funds may look for bargains as distressed properties emerge. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which operates a fund, told Reuters it would “closely monitor market conditions with a view to capturing appropriate opportunities”. 
And in an uncertain world, some academics argue that property remains a solid bet for savvy investors. 
Barnes of UCL said sovereign funds could be “lighter on their feet” than some other institutional funds and more able to adjust their behaviour to suit changing circumstances. 
“Real estate is one of the better sectors to be in, in a world of turmoil,” she added. “But it’s very much about picking the right real estate.”

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings on Friday reported a 6% decline in sales for the nine-months to June 30, due to COVID-19-related trading restrictions imposed worldwide. 
Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, said sales from continuing operations for the period fell to 6.8 billion euros ($8.08 billion) from 7.2 billion euros in the same period the previous year. 
The retailer said while almost all of its stores had reopened by the end of June, a significant amount of trade had been lost while they were closed. 
“Since lockdown restrictions began to be lifted from early May, revenues are trending back to, and in some cases above, pre-COVID-19 levels,” the retailer said, 
Its cash position from operations at the end of the period was better than what it had estimated at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Sales at Pepkor Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary based in South Africa, fell 10% while sales of furniture retailer Conforama and Greenlit Brands, a household goods retailer and manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, declined 18% and 1% respectively. 
Pepco Group, another subsidiary which owns British discount retailer Poundland, was the only retailer to lift sales by 2% as revenue recovered when restrictions were eased. 
Steinhoff said Poundland continued to reduce its property costs by renegotiating 100 store leases during the period. 
Plans to possibly list its Australian Fantastic Group retailer remain in the early stages, with no definitive decision taken yet, the retailer said.

The World Health Organization has released its guidance on face masks for children, as students in some parts of the country at least return to their classrooms to start the new school year. Children age 5 and younger shouldnt be required to wear masks, the WHO says, since most are not able to put them on without help. 
Children age 6 through 11, however, should wear masks under certain conditions, including local infection rates, whether theres an adult available to help them, and if theyll be exposed to elderly people or people with health conditions who are at higher risk of complications from the virus. 
Kids 12 and older should wear masks under the same conditions adults would wear them, using the standard social-distancing guidelines, WHO said in its release.
WHO Worked with UNICEF, the International Pediatric Association and other health organizations and experts to come up with the guidelines. Their findings stress that there is limited evidence about how the coronavirus is transmitted in children, but that some evidence shows younger children may have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults, but that this may vary by age. Older children may be more likely to spread the virus than younger ones, according to WHO. 
Further, the WHO advises that the benefits of children wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 should be weighed against potential harm associated with wearing masks, including feasibility and discomfort, as well as social and communication concerns.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, between July 30th and August 13th, there were more than 75,000 new cases of the coronavirus in children, marking a 24 percent increase in the total. As of last month, more than 340,000 children had tested positive, roughly 9 percent of the total cases in the US. 
Medical experts say there are very few medical reasons to preclude most people from wearing cloth face coverings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a July 14th update that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 that could reduce the spread of the disease, adding that there is increasing evidence that cloth face coverings help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.

The dog was quarantined in an animal center after getting a ""weak positive"" result in a test for the disease COVID-19.
However, the dog has not shown any symptoms of the virus, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Friday.
The spokesman said the dog belongs to a patient infected with the virus.
A low level of the virus was found in the dog's nasal and oral cavities, and officials will now run more tests to see if the dog is actually sick.
The other possibility is that the test results are the result of ""environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose.""

The dog will be tested multiple times and ""will only be returned when the test result is negative.""
Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, the head of the communicable disease branch of Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said that health authorities would review the entire list of confirmed infected patients in the city and determine if any had pets that would needed to be tested, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported. 
But both Hong Kong officials and global health experts say that there is no evidence to suggest pets can get infected or can spread the virus to humans.
The spokesman said on Friday: ""At present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected with COVID-19 virus or can be a source of infection to people.""
The World Health Organization also said: ""At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.""

The AFCD said that the dog in question is the only dog quarantined at a facility in a Hong Kong port, and that ""staff of the department will step up cleansing and disinfection of the animal keeping facility.""
The statement said that pet owners should ""maintain a good habit of hygiene, and wash their hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol sanitizer after contacting pets. Pet owners shall wear masks while going out.""
""If there are any changes in the health condition of the pets, advice from veterinarians should be sought as soon as possible.""
Some regions have started taking action against the animals despite health officials stating that there is not evidence that cats and dogs can infect humans.
Reuters reported that authorities in Moscow, Russia, have rounded up stray animals and exterminated rats in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. Animal rights groups have criticized the move.

In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, some people have been putting masks on their dogs.
The city of around 11 million people has been under lockdown for more than a month. Thousands of pets there have been abandoned because their owners are quarantined or unable to return to the city.
Some volunteer groups are breaking into apartments to feed pets at their owners' requests, but they say they are overwhelmed by the number of pets in the city.
Wild animals have also been killed by the disinfectant used to fight the coronavirus."

The US could invoke a 1950s-era law that would allow the government to ramp up the production of gear to combat the spread of the coronavirus, a senior administration official and a congressional aide familiar with the matter said Friday.  
The Trump administration is exploring the potential use of the Defense Production Act to increase the domestic availability of protective masks and clothing, according to the officials, but no final decision has been made. 
""A lot of things are under discussion,"" the administration official told Business Insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
The proposal to invoke the law, which was first reported by Reuters, gives the president the broad authority over industrial output in the name of national security. 
It comes days after the Centers for Disease Control warned the respiratory illness COVID-19 would almost certainly hit communities in the US. The novel coronavirus has spread outside of its epicenter in China to more than four dozen countries, raising concerns among governments and health officials about the potential for a pandemic. 
The White House referred questions on the proposal to the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who was tapped on Wednesday to lead the government response to the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesperson at the Department of Health and Human Services said it would ""not comment on internal deliberations."" The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.
The Defense Production Act, which was passed in response to the Korean War, authorizes the president to take actions to ""force private industry to give priority to defense and homeland security contracts and to allocate the resources needed,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. 
It could be implemented through company contract requirements and various financial measures including loans and purchase commitments. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has prompted nations to roll out restrictions on travel and commerce, raising concerns about disruptions to supply chains and broader business operations. 
Honeywell International, one of the largest producers of face masks, said it has experienced a surge in demand for protective gear in recent weeks and that it was open to coordination with the US government. 
""We are increasing production at multiple facilities globally to address the growing demand,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. ""We are ready and willing to partner with the US government to support national response efforts."" 
Congressional appropriators plan to soon unveil an emergency funding to address the coronavirus outbreak. The White House initially requested a $2.5 billion package that diverted some money from other federal accounts, but Trump has since signaled he was open to the $8 billion Democrats said was necessary. 
HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday the nation may need 300 million N95 masks, used by health workers with direct exposure to airborne infections. The government currently has about 30 million of the respirators in an emergency stockpile, he said."

22 with 17 posters participating
The lackluster federal response to the COVID-19 crisis has become even lighter on details in recent days, as the administration pushes hard on a message of ""reopening"" while leaving out any data or expertise that might conflict with that focus. 
The White House has done everything possible to minimize messaging that might scare Americans into staying home and instead ""relies on tightly controlling information"" about the novel coronavirus disease, the Washington Post reports.
A source the Post described as a senior administration official told the paper that the task force addressing the crisis was already meeting less often before President Donald Trump said Wednesday its focus would be shifting away from emergency management and toward economic reopening. Public health warnings are scaring people, the source added, so the administration has been downplaying them.
The White House expressly prohibited task force members from accepting invitations to Congressional hearings, following a request from a House subcommittee. Members of the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, are however scheduled to testify before the Senate this month about the administration's response. Trump on Tuesday told reporters the difference is one of politics, saying, ""The House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters."" 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which one would ordinarily expect to be heavily involved in managing a pandemic, has been kept quiet since March. The agency's last press briefing on the novel coronavirus was March 9, when about 20 people in the US were known to have died due to COVID-19. As of today, more than 75,000 people in the US have died as a result of the disease.
Yesterday, the AP made public a leaked 17-page reopening guide put together by the CDC. Administration officials allegedly told the CDC its report, which included detailed guidelines for industries such as restaurants and child care, would ""never see the light of day.""
The void made by the absence of CDC press conferences has instead been filled with messaging directly from the White House, such as Trump's infamously questionable suggestion to America to consider injections of bleach or other disinfectants to cure the disease. (A reminder: Do not do this.) In the past week, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has taken over the briefings, and she continues to push the administration's messaging about economic recovery.
Experts have argued that states are not ready for phased reopening under the current plans made public by the administration, but governors in states such as Georgia and Texas have continued with rapid reopening efforts this week undeterred.
The administration seems comfortable with the human cost of sweeping expertise aside. The president agreed in an interview earlier this week that ""there'll be more death"" in the US from a rapid reopening. ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon,"" Trump told ABC News. 
Denial, however, has not proved a mitigating strategy for handling COVID-19 in the White House or elsewhere. The disease continues to spread nationwide, and that includes inside the Administration. At least three staffers who work directly with Trump or Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the disease in the past 24 hours, including Trump's valet and Pence spokesperson Katie Miller, who is also married to White House adviser Stephen Miller."

Two closely related anti-malarial drugs championed by President Donald Trump as promising treatments for COVID-19 appear to substantially increase the risks of death and heart complications in patients hospitalized from the disease.
Thats according to the largest study yet on the topic, which involved more than 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients on six continents. The peer-reviewed study, appearing Friday in The Lancet, was led by Mandeep Mehra, a professor of medicine at Harvard.
The drugs studied included chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as malaria. Early laboratory work suggested that they also have potent anti-viral properties. But small clinical studies looking into potential benefits for COVID-19 patients have largely provided mixed and inconclusive results to this point.
Still, some of those small, uncontrolled studies suggesting benefits have gained traction and have led to undue optimism that the drugs can treat the pandemic disease. President Trump in particular has touted the drugs, calling them a game changer, even this week telling reporters that he is taking hydroxychloroquine. A couple of weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think its good; Ive heard a lot of good stories, he said Monday, May 18.
That revelation goes against a recent announcement by the US Food and Drug Administration that the drugs ""should be limited to clinical trial settings or for treating certain hospitalized patients."" The FDA made the recommendation in light of reports of potentially fatal heart rhythm problems linked to the drugs, which have been given at higher doses than those used for autoimmune and malaria patients.
Sobering stats
The new, large study out today seems to bolster those concernsand deflate overblown hopes.
Mehra and colleagues looked at the medical records of more than 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 671 hospitals in various countries. Their average age was about 54, and about 54 percent were male.
Of the patients, nearly 15,000 had received one of four treatments involving one of the drugs1,868 received chloroquine, 3,783 received chloroquine with a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin), 3,016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6,221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (a combination Trump has also promoted). Over 81,000 other hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study did not receive any of these regimens and were considered a control group.The researchers primarily looked at risks of in-hospital deaths and serious heart arrhythmias.
Comparing the treatment groups to controls and adjusting each patients risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, the researchers found the following:
<ul><li>COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine alone had a 34-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 137-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide had a 45-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 411-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given chloroquine had a 37-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 256-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given chloroquine and a macrolide had a 37-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 301-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li></ul>Mehra and colleagues conclude:
In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19.
The study has some significant limitations, including that it is merely an observational studynot a randomized, controlled trial thought of as a gold standard for assessing treatments. As an observational study, it cannot prove cause and effect; it only reveals associations with the treatments. Randomized trialsseveral of which are currently underwayare still needed to definitely determine risks and benefits of the drug.
While the researchers tried to adjust for patients differing risk factors, it's possible that other, unmeasured factors influenced the course of their illnesses. Also, the findings dont speak to risks or outcomes for patients who are not hospitalized with COVID-19 and have milder or asymptomatic infections.
Despite the limitations, experts still say the study is enlightening. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine highlighted in a statement to media that the study may have biases and inadequate adjustments for risks, but it can be stated with some confidence that it is unlikely that the randomized trials will find substantial benefit to these drugs, and the excess in heart rhythm problems is consistent with everything we know about them.
He continued: A definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomized trials, but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of COVID-19 other than in the context of a randomized trial. It might even be said that to go on giving them other than in a trial is unethical, given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence.
Babak Javid, an infectious disease expert at Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing, said in a statement that the study certainly casts a great deal of doubt whether these agents are effective in the setting in which these drugs are currently being used in COVID-19 patients: i.e. severely ill patients in hospital.

An expert with the World Health Organization on Monday made brief comments about asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 that sparked a firestorm of confusion, backlash, and criticism.
Some public health experts were quick to lash out at the organization for poor messaging. Others tried to clarify what the WHO expert might have been trying to say. And still others quickly impeached evidence-based strategies to combat the pandemic virus.
On Tuesday, the WHO responded with a live Q&amp;A on social media to address confusion and lingering questions about transmission. In it, the WHO expert who made the confusing comments on Monday tried to clarify the issue and add context and caveats. But the response may still leave some confused and frustrated.
Here, well try to clear the air around what was said, what maybe should have been said, and what we do and dont know about transmission of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
What we know
First and foremost: people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but do not have symptoms canand dospread the virus to other people. To put it another way: people who seem healthy and do not have classic COVID-19 symptoms may actually be infected and can still pass on the virus to other people, infecting them.
We know this is possible, and we know that it happens. No public health expert is saying otherwiseincluding those at the WHO.
Moreover, we know that there are two scenarios in which this can happen.
Some people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will never develop symptoms from their infectionthat is, from the time they are infected with the virus to the time that the virus is no longer reproducing in their cells and, thus, they are no longer infected. The WHO considers these cases asymptomatic. If asymptomatic people spread the virus to someone else during their silent infection, that spread would be considered asymptomatic transmission.
In the other scenario, people who are infected and initially do not have symptoms later go on to develop symptoms, sometimes very mild ones. In fact, data suggests that a person can test positive for the infection one to three days before symptoms develop. Symptoms tend to develop between five to six days after an exposure to the virus, but it can take as long as 14 days. Studies have found that viral sheddinghow much infectious virus particles are spewing out of an infected personappears to be highest in the few days around the first day of symptoms.
That means that infected people can test positive for the virus and spread the virus to others before their symptoms develop.
So far, so good
Heres where this gets confusing.
Regardless of when in the course of an infection an infected person develops symptoms, they are considered to have a symptomatic case overall.
But if they test positive while they have no symptoms and then go on to develop symptoms, they would be considered pre-symptomatic at the time of the testing. But, if theres no follow-up with the case to know if they ever develop symptoms, they could be misclassified as asymptomatic.
If they spread the virus to someone else while they are pre-symptomatic, that could be considered pre-symptomatic transmission OR asymptomatic transmission because they were asymptomatic at the time of transmission.
Im using could in these sentences because different experts and studies use these terms differently. See how confusing this is?
Then, of course, there are the straight symptomatic cases that we understand very well. From these cases, its clear that SARS-CoV-2 spreads in large respiratory droplets, launched out of a mouth or nose from sneezing, coughing, loud talking, or heavy breathing. We know that the these droplets tend to not go farther than one to two meters away from an infected person. So, the most effective way to prevent this type of transmission is to keep physical distance from others who may be infected. When physical distancing is not possible, experts recommend a face mask.
So, to sum up:
Symptomatic case = Someone who is infected and has symptoms, at some point.
Asymptomatic case = Someone who is infected but never develops symptoms.
Pre-symptomatic = The phase of a symptomatic infection when a person may test positive for the virus and/or may spread the virus but has not yet developed symptoms.
Pre-symptomatic transmission = Spread of the virus from a symptomatic case during their pre-symptomatic phase.
Asymptomatic transmission = Spread of the virus from an infected person with no current symptoms. This transmission could be from a pre-symptomatic person or a truly asymptomatic case, depending on how the terms are being used.
The WHO has consistently used asymptomatic transmission only when talking about truly asymptomatic cases.
What we dont know
Theres a lot about transmission we dont know.
For one thing, we dont have a clear picture of how many infected people have symptomatic cases and how many have asymptomatic cases. Estimates of the percentage of cases that are asymptomatic vary wildly, with some ranging from 4 percent to 45 percent.
From there, were not certain which types of cases are transmitting the infection and whenthat is, we dont know what proportion of asymptomatic cases spread the infection to others. Some data suggest a small fractionsuch as 6.4 percentof asymptomatic cases transmit the virus, while other modeling data estimates that 40 percent of all transmission in the pandemic is from asymptomatic cases.
For symptomatic cases, we dont know what proportion is spreading the infection before they develop symptoms. This, too, has a large range of estimates.
The WHO has held that, according to its view of the data, symptomatic cases still appear to be behind the majority of new infections, whether that occurs during the pre-symptomatic phase or not. As such, the organization pushes the proven strategies of isolating symptomatic cases and tracing, quarantining, and testing contacts.
What the WHO initially said
Amid all this uncertainty and confusion, the issue of asymptomatic transmission came up in a regular WHO press conference Monday, June 8.
A reporter with Reuters noted that a Singapore health official had reported that nearly half of new cases there appeared to be asymptomatic. The reporter asked the WHO whether its possible that [asymptomatic cases] have a bigger role than the WHO initially thought in propagating the pandemic and what the policy implications of that might be?
WHOs COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, provided the notorious response (transcript here).
Kerkhovewho is an epidemiologistfirst tried to define the case terms aboveasymptomatic, pre-symptomaticand explain that the WHO doesnt take the use of the term asymptomatic at face value. But her response was muddled and fragmented.
In a number of countries when we go back and we discuss with them, one, how are these asymptomatic cases being identified, many of them are being identified through contact tracing, which is what we want to see, that you have a known case, you find your contacts, theyre already in quarantine hopefully and some of them are tested, she said. Then you pick up people who may have asymptomatic or no symptoms or even mild symptoms.
The other thing were finding is that when we go back and say, how many of them were truly asymptomatic we find out that many have really mild disease, theyre notquote, unquoteCOVID symptoms meaning they may not have developed ever yet, they may not have had a significant cough or they may not have shortness of breath but some may have mild disease."

The World Health Organization on Wednesday announced that it is abandoning use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trialthe organizations massive, global clinical trial of potential COVID-19 treatments.
The WHO cited early data from the trial and others showing that hydroxychloroquine does not lower the risk of death or provide any other clinical benefit in hospitalized patients.
Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial, the WHO said in a statement. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician.
The decision comes just two days after the US Food and Drug Administration revoked its Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine. The EUA had allowed doctors in the United States to prescribe the drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials.
Like the WHO, the FDA made its decision to revoke the EUA  based on early trial data that showed no evidence of benefit for mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation.
One of the main sources of that data is the Recovery Trial, a large, randomized trial in the UK run by researchers at the University of Oxford. On June 5, the lead investigators of the trial announced they were halting the use of hydroxychloroquine after reviewing early data.
A total of 1,542 patients were randomized to hydroxychloroquine and compared with 3,132 patients randomized to usual care alone, they reported. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality (25.7% hydroxychloroquine vs. 23.5% usual care; hazard ratio 1.11 [95% confidence interval 0.98-1.26]; p=0.10). There was also no evidence of beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes.
These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, they concluded.
Promising start
Hydroxychloroquinewhich is approved for use against malaria and autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritisappeared to have some anti-viral activity in early laboratory testing. Its also thought to have immune-modulating affects, which have been hypothesized to be helpful in treating severe cases of COVID-19. But evidence to support its use in the coronavirus pandemic has always been thin; early trials produced mixed and inconclusive findings of effectiveness against COVID-19.
Still, the drug rose to prominence and became politicized after being repeatedly touted by US President Donald Trump, who called it a game changer and even told reporters that he was taking it as a prophylactic.
Muddling the issue, a high-profile study in The Lancet reported that not only was hydroxychloroquine ineffective, it increased rates of death and heart-rhythm complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Though heart-rhythm complications are a known risk of hydroxychloroquine, the findings were determined to be based on a dubious dataset from an equally dubious data analytics company. The study has been retracted.
But, with data from reputable studies coming out, its becoming clearer that hydroxychloroquine is, unfortunately, not effective at treating COVID-19.
Other trials are still ongoing to assess whether it could prevent an infection with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The WHO noted in its announcement todays decision to end hydroxycloroquines use in the Solidarity trial, which looks at stopping COVID-19, does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.
However, results from those trials are not looking good either. One recently published study involving 821 people who had been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 found taking hydroxychloroquine after exposure did not prevent people from becoming ill. According to Science magazine, a Spanish study on post-exposure prophylaxis involving 2,300 people also found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine.
The WHOs Solidarity trial will carry on with the other potential treatments for COVID-19, which include the HIV treatment lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, and interferon beta-1a. The Solidarity trial is enrolling thousands of COVID-19 patients in over 400 hospitals in 35 counties."

0 with 0 posters participating
Given the radical changes people have undertaken to limit the spread of COVID-19 (hello month six of quarantine-except-for-groceries), many have naturally wondered what impact this has had on pollution, including greenhouse gases and climate change. Some short-lived pollutants dropped noticeably during the strong lockdowns of April, as businesses shuttered and travel was reduced. But CO2 levels don't fluctuate based on short-term events like that, so the long-term effect on climate change was expected to be trivially smallassuming economies rebounded fairly quickly.
A new study led by the University of Leeds Piers Forster (and his daughter Harriet) takes advantage of phone location data to re-examine the first six months of the year, tracking more than just CO2. While they ultimately find that the impact has been small, their results also highlight that the way economies choose to rebound could have a much bigger effect over the long term.
The work relies on mobility data made public by Google and Apple, covering 114 countries. Using that along with energy and emissions datasets, the researchers converted behavior changes into pollution changes. The phone data record changes in transportation use quite well, although purported changes in activity between residential, commercial, and industrial settings are harder to relate to energy. The researchers compared the changes they saw in their phone data to a May study that estimated April emissions using things like utility data. They found their phone-based estimate of home energy use probably overestimates the real change.
Why might this be the case? To give one example, data from smart meters in the UK show that energy use increased around 20 percent when people started working from homes that were previously empty during the day, but only increased four percent for homes that were previously occupied. The phone data wouldn't capture these differences. The researchers also note that changes are likely exaggerated in places like India, where the subset of the population with smart phones may have been more likely to work jobs that allowed them to work from home. So the pollution reductions estimated from this data are probably on the high end of plausible.
Its also worth noting that data were not available for China, so numbers from that May study were used to fill in there.
In the end, they estimate significant drops in emissions for a number of pollutantsthe largest change coming in April, with a gradual recovery through June. The most impactful changes for the climate turn out to be sulfur dioxide and the nitrogen oxides.
The emissions of many pollutants were significantly reduced during lockdownfor a while, at least.
Sulfur dioxide pollution produces aerosol particles in the atmosphere that scatter sunlight back to space, cooling the planet. Reduced emissions of this pollutant were primarily due to slowed industrial activity; the changes were also rapid, as aerosols wash out of the atmosphere fairly quickly. Nitrogen oxide emissions, on the other hand, were primarily driven down by reduced transportation activity. These gases react to produce ozone in the lower atmosphere. Since that is a greenhouse gas, it results in a warming effect.
Estimating the impact on average temperatures from 2020-2025, these two changes approximately cancel out. The drop in nitrogen oxide emissions over the first half of the year would cause about 0.01°C of cooling (0.018°F if tiny isnt relatable enough for you), while the drop in sulfur aerosols would cause slightly more warming than that.
Take into account the brief dip in CO2 emissions, and the total effect of the lockdowns would be something like 0.01°C cooler temperatures by 2030. Its not impressive.
The bigger question is whether anything changes after the pandemic finally ends. To look at that question, the researchers simulate several scenarios through 2050. Theres the two-year blip scenario, where lockdown reductions continue to a lesser extent through 2021, rebounding afterwards to match the emissions trajectory we'd get if countries met their current pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement. They also run a fossil-fueled recovery scenario, where national economic stimulus plans favor fossil fuels, and two green stimulus scenarios, where plans favor major investments in efficiency and renewables.
Different emissions scenarios for post-pandemic economic recovery make a big different in the long-term.
The high and low scenarios diverge by around 0.3°C by 2050, with the low scenario actually representing peak warming of just 1.5°C above pre-industrial.
The researchers write, Our work shows that the global temperature signal due to the short-term dynamics of the pandemic is likely to be small. These results highlight that without underlying long-term, system-wide decarbonization of economies, even massive shifts in behavior only lead to modest reductions in the rate of warming. However, economic investment choices for the recovery will strongly affect the warming trajectory by mid-century. Pursuing a green stimulus recovery out of the post-COVID-19 economic crisis can set the world on track for keeping the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement within sight.

Maryland reported its highest number of new COVID-19 cases on Tuesdayjust four days after the state began easing public health restrictions aimed at thwarting the spread of disease.
Though state officials note that an increase in testing and a backlog of test results may partly explain the spike, case counts overall suggest that disease transmission is not on the declineand transmission could very easily increase as residents begin venturing into public spaces more frequently.
Marylands outcome may hold lessons for other states attempting their own reopening. As of today, May 20, all 50 states have begun easing restrictions at some level, according to The Washington Post.
In Maryland, officials reported 1,784 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. That figure surpasses the previous highest daily toll on May 1 of 1,730 new cases. Otherwise, the states other high daily tolls are around 1,200 new cases.
In the 24-hour period in which the spike was reported, the Old Line State also reported that 5,368 people had tested negative, according to NPR. That means that about 25 percent of tests from that time frame were positive for the disease.
Health experts generally consider a positive rate of 10 percent or less as a benchmark indicating that an area is performing enough testing and has a good handle on the state of an outbreak.
Despite the new cases and the fact that it is under a state of emergency, Maryland began reopening businesses last Friday. Retailers, churches, and hair salons were allowed to reopen at 50-percent capacity under a Safer at Home policy.
Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the decision given that hospitalizations and hospital bed occupancy were either stable or in decline, as NPR noted. He also said the state had the means to perform contact tracing for up to 1,000 cases per daya figure that was significantly surpassed on Tuesday.
In total, Maryland has confirmed over 42,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths. Many of those are in a corridor stretching from Baltimore to Washington, DC. Montgomery County, Maryland, which borders Northwest DC, reported 533 of the states 1,784 new cases Tuesday, for instance.
The DC metro area in particular has had a hard time shaking the outbreak. Reuters reported Tuesday that a senior White House official said that the DC metro areaalong with Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolisremains in an unexpected plateau of COVID-19 transmission."

As deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic begin to plateau and slowly decline in some parts of Europe and the United States, the devastation is reaching a fever pitch in Latin America.
Death tolls in cities and areas of Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador are reaching alarming levelsin some places five-times higher than normal death ratesaccording to an analysis by The New York Times.
While some of the official death tolls from the pandemic remain low, a review of mortality data by the Times reveals significant increases. The death counts include those directly from COVID-19 and also those from other causeswhich in some cases may be due in part to people not being able to receive a standard level of care while health systems are overwhelmed during the pandemic.
In the last two months, deaths in Lima, Peru, doubled over historical averages. In Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas in Brazil, deaths for April reached about 2,800three times the historical average. Gravediggers in the city reportedly stacked coffins three layers deep into mass graves to try to keep up with the body count.
In the port city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, deaths spiked to five-times the averagean increase comparable to the spike in deaths seen in New York City during the worst of its outbreak. Residents in Guayaquil were reportedly forced to leave dead bodies in cardboard boxes on the streets for days.
SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, was slow to make its way to Latin America. But despite its delayed arrival, many areas have struggled to prepare. Guatemala and Haiti have only around 100 ventilators between them, according to an article last month in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Mexico, the article also noted, has high rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which are risk factors for severe disease.
It is a very difficult situation, Alfonso Rodríguez-Morales, from Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases, told the journal. Obviously the healthcare systems are not trained for coronavirus; we had a little extra time to get ready for the arrival of the disease but some places are really going to struggle.
Theres also been issues with messaging. In February, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that COVID-19 was not even as bad as the flu. Brazils president, Jair Bolsonaro, had been dismissive of the death toll and the need for social distancing. When asked recently about the countrys mounting death toll, he responded: So what? Im sorry. What do you want me to do? according to the Times.
Nicaragua, meanwhile, has refused to impose social-distancing measures, and there are media reports that the government is covering up the extent of its outbreak. So far, only 25 cases and eight deaths have been reported in the country of roughly 6.5 million. The figure is likely a vast underestimate.
Even without accurate figures, the overall picture is not looking good. We are deeply concerned with how rapidly the pandemic is expanding, Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), said in a press statement May 12. She continued:
In South America, health systems in large urban centers like Lima and Rio de Janeiro are quickly becoming overwhelmed. We are also witnessing a similar impact of COVID-19 on big cities across the Amazon basin.
When transmission is high in areas that function as regional hubs, neighboring areas are then quickly affectedas people move through roads and riversimpacting smaller towns and remote communities, including indigenous areas, where access to health care is challenging.
PAHO continues to coordinate the response across countries, but we call on national and local health authorities to work even more closely together to contain the spread of the virus and support health systems capacity."

The only restrictions still in place are at the border. Entry to New Zealand is mostly being limited to citizens and residents. Those entering are required to complete a 14-day quarantine and be tested.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernwho has earned international praise for her handling of the pandemicwas thrilled by the news. In a press conference, she confessed that when she first heard it, she did a little dance in front of her daughter Neve, who is just shy of 2 years old. ""I showed Neve, she was caught a little by surprise but she joined in, having absolutely no idea why I was dancing around the lounge but enjoying it nonetheless,"" Ardern said.
The celebration comes just 101 days since New Zealand identified its first case, 75 days of being on any of the four COVID-19 alert levels, and 26 days of being at level 2.
Seventeen days have passed since any Kiwis have turned up positive for the infection, even though labs there have run more than 40,000 tests in that time frame. In the last week, labs reported running an average of 1,891 tests per day.
In all, the country of about 5 million has documented only 1,504 confirmed and probable cases, with 22 deathsall the deaths were in people who were aged 60 or above. The country has run a total of nearly 300,000 tests since testing began January 22. Officials confirmed the first case on February 28, in a person who had returned from Iran.
We went hard and early
New Zealands success is attributed to its relatively swift and aggressive efforts to ramp up testing and tracing, isolate cases, quarantine contacts, and institute lockdownsplus its geographical advantage of being an island nation has been helpful.
The government unveiled its four-level alert system in late March, which provided clear, countrywide measures to address each state of transmission. Level 4, the lockdown level, goes into effect when the disease is likely not contained and spreading through the community.
If the state of the outbreak improves such that theres still community transmission but clusters of infections can be managed by testing and contact tracing, the country moves to Level 3, the restrict level. At this point, some social-distancing measures can be lifted; schools can reopen and small gatherings of 10 or fewer are allowed, for instance.
When community transmission is contained but risk of it lingers, the country moves to level 2, the reduce level. Here, gatherings can be as large as 100, and businesses can resume some activities while still requiring people to keep physical distance from one another.
Last is level 1, the prepare level. Social-distancing measures and other restrictions are lifted, but testing and tracing capacity remain at the ready, sick people must stay at home, and everyone should continue to practice enhanced hygiene. Additionally, people are encouraged to log their whereabouts to aid any potential need to trace disease spread in the future. To help with this, businesses are encouraged to have QR codes at doorways so people can keep a digital diary of their whereabouts.
United
When the alert levels were released on March 21, the level was set to 2. There were just 56 confirmed and probable cases at the time. By March 25, the government moved to level 4. By then, labs had completed 13,382 tests, and officials had identified 205 confirmed and probable cases.
We have community transmission in New Zealand, confirmed in four cases and suspected in other cases we are investigating, a March 25 media release from the Ministry of Health read.
We move tonight to Alert level 4. We will see a rise in cases for the next 10 days, from people infected before today. The numbers will continue to increase before they turn around. That turnaround will happen if we all do what is asked of us. If we all play our part we will break the chain of community transmission.
In todays announcement on moving to level 1, Ardern noted that the country went hard and early and united in an unprecedented ways to crush the virus.
Our team of 5 million has both sacrificed and achieved a huge amount in just under 11 weeks.""
But, she noted that the elimination now doesnt mean New Zealand has forever rid itself of the new coronavirus, which is still raging in many places around the globe, including the United States.
We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now, but elimination is not a point in time, it is a sustained effort, she said at the news conference. We almost certainly will see cases here again, and I do want to say that again, we will almost certainly see cases here again, and that is not a sign that we have failed, it is a reality of this virus. But if and when that occurs we have to make sureand we arethat we are prepared."

The COVID-19 crisis is hitting almost every market sector hard, and now the dominos are starting to fall. As other small, medium, and large businesses pare back operations or shutter for good, the tech firms that rely on enterprise clients are themselves taking heavy losses and laying off personnel.
Both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and IBM this week announced significant cost-cutting measures, including pay cuts and significant job losses.
IBM announced its layoffs late Thursday. In a statement, the company said the ""highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly remix high-value skills,"" which in this case means deciding you no longer place a high value on the skills a significant number of employees bring to the socially distanced table.
IBM, like many firms now facing cuts and layoffs, was not in the best of financial situations before COVID-19 hit. The company's CEO, Arvind Krishna, has been with the company for decades but only stepped into the top seat in April, saying at the time he was focused on building up the parts of the company that support cloud computing and artificial intelligence and willing to move away from the rest.
IBM did not specify how many positions were being cut, but both The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News report thousands of employees were affected in five states: California, New York, North Carolina, Missouri, and Pennsylvania.
Employees, who spoke to Bloomberg on the condition of anonymity, reported entire teams are being cut and mentioned receiving severance packages. IBM said in a statement it would offer subsidized medical coverage to affected employees for the next 12 months.
HPE also announced its cost-cutting plans on Thursday as part of its more recent quarterly earnings report. The company will cut some salaries through at least October 31, with executives seeing pay cuts of 20 to 25 percent. The company, like younger tech brethren such as Facebook and Twitter, says it will further save money by embracing remote work in the longer term, allowing it to shutter some offices.
Although the company expects to conduct layoffs, company leadership did not specify in which divisions or how many jobs are at stake. For now, the company said it is ""working through the details in the next couple months"" to determine what makes sense for the business.
The older, stalwart enterprise firms are not alone. Modern tech upstarts such asUber and Lyft have laid off thousands of workers in response to cratering consumer demand during the plague year 2020."

The US surpassed 4 million cases of COVID-19 Thursday as the pandemic shows no signs of easing. Already, nearly 144,000 people in the country have died from the disease.
Yesterday saw more than 70,000 new cases tallied, with a seven-day average of nearly 67,000 new cases per day, according to data collected by The COVID Tracking Project.
With the ongoing surges, hospitalizations are nearing a new record during the pandemic. There are currently 59,628 people hospitalized across the country. Thats slightly below the previous peak on April 15 of 59,940. Deaths are also on the upswing, with a seven-day average of 834 deaths a day. The last two days have seen death tolls over 1,000. Southern states and hotspots in western states, such as California, are seeing the most significant disease spread.
With the sick still streaming into hospitals, experts expect the death rate will continue to climb in the coming weeks to months. Thats how long it is before some of the patients entering the hospital now succumb to their disease.
Coming up short
Exacerbating the crisis are reports that COVID-19 testing laboratories are overwhelmed. Turnaround time for getting test results back to patients has slowed to a crawlin some place taking weeks. This has left the uninfected needlessly waiting in extended quarantines. For those who are infected, the long-delayed test results make it impossible to trace contacts and quarantine anyone exposed before they themselves could pass on the virus.
Laboratories have access to high-throughput machines that can run thousands of tests a day. In fact, the United States is running more tests now than ever during the pandemic, reporting results 800,000 tests Wednesday. In mid-April, the country was running just around 150,000 tests a day.
Still, labs could be running even more tests than they are now. As the AP reports, laboratories and hospitals running tests are stifled by global shortages of testing reagents and suppliesin addition to the climbing demand. For instance, Bobbi Pritt of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told the outlet that the hospitals machines are running at just 20 percent capacity due to shortages.
Quest Diagnostics, one of the nations largest testing chains, told the AP that it simply cant keep up with demand during the current surge in cases. The company said patients should expect waits of a week or longer to get results. It also recommended that doctors hold off on testing low-priority patients, such as those without symptoms or known contact with an infected person."

1 with 1 posters participating
The clearest way out of the COVID-19 crisis is to develop a safe, effective vaccineand scientists have wasted no time in getting started.
They have at least 102 vaccine candidates in development worldwide. Eight of those have already entered early clinical trials in people. At least two have protected a small number of monkeys from infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19.
Some optimistic vaccine developers say that, if all goes perfectly, we could see large-scale production and limited deployment of vaccines as early as this fall. If true, it would be an extraordinary achievement. Less than four months ago, SARS-CoV-2 was an unnamed, never-before-seen virus that abruptly emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Researchers there quickly identified it and, by late January, had deciphered and shared its genetic code, allowing researchers around the world to get to work on defeating it. By late February, researchers on multiple continents were working up clinical trials for vaccine candidates. By mid-March, two of them began, and volunteers began receiving the first jabs of candidate vaccines against COVID-19.
Its a record-setting feat. But, its unclear if researchers will be able to maintain this break-neck pace.
Generally, vaccines must go through three progressively more stringent human trial phases before they are considered safe and effective. The phases assess the candidates safety profile, the strength of the immune responses they trigger, and how good they are at actually protecting people from infection and disease.
Most vaccine candidates dont make it. By some estimates, more than 90 percent fail. And, though a pandemic-propelled timeline could conceivably deliver a vaccine in as little as 18 months, most vaccines take yearsoften more than 10 years, in factto go from preclinical vetting to a syringe in a doctors office.
Abridging that timeline can up the risk of failure. For instance, vaccine candidates usually enter the three phases of clinical trials only after being well tested in lab animals that can model the human disease. But, with such a new virus, there is no established animal model for COVID-19. And amid a devastating pandemic, theres not enough time to thoroughly develop one. Some researchers are now doing that ground-level animal work in parallel with human trialssuch as the small monkey trials mentioned above.
Researchers already have reason to be a little anxious about the safety of any COVID-19 vaccine. When they tried in the past to make vaccines against some of SARS-CoV-2s coronavirus relatives, they found a small number of instances when candidate vaccines seemed to make infections worse. That is, these candidate vaccines seemed to prompt berserk immune responses that caused lung damage in monkeys and liver damage in ferrets. Researchers still dont fully understand the problem and dont know if it could happen in humans, let alone if it will show up with the new candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
But we may soon know the answers. As the pandemic tops the grim milestone of three million cases worldwide and well over 200,000 deaths, researchers are relentlessly moving forward with vaccine development. Here's where the scientific community currently stands in its frenetic effort.
First, the basics
Researchers are using a wide variety of tools and techniques to develop a vaccinesome are tried and tested, others are fresh and unproven. Regardless of the strategy, they all aim to do the same thing: train the immune system to identify SARS-CoV-2 (or some element of it) and destroy it before it establishes an infection and causes COVID-19.
The way a vaccine can pull this off, typically, is by feeding immune cells a signature element of a disease-causing germ, such as a unique protein that coats the outside of a dangerous virus. From there, a type of white blood cell called B cells can generate antibodies that specifically recognize and glom onto those signature germ elements. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins, which have their germ-specific detecting regions on their outstretched arms. The base of their Y shape is a generic region that can signal certain immune responses if they detect an invading germ.
A strong, effective vaccine can generate so-called neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies circulate in the blood, surveilling the whole body after a vaccine is given. If the germ theyre trained to detect actually shows up, the antibodies can swarm and paralyze it. The base of the antibodiesnow dangling off their smothered target germcan then signal immune cells to help finish the job.
In the case of COVID-19, the goal of candidate vaccines is to train our immune systems to make antibodies that specifically detect and destroy SARS-CoV-2 (which is, again, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Though theres a lot we dont know about SARS-CoV-2, we know enough of the basics to direct early vaccine development.
We know that SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus related to two other notorious betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes MERS.
Coronaviruses, generally, keep their genetic blueprints in the form of a large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is bundled into a round viral particle. That genetic code provides the molecular instructions to make all of the components of the virus, including enzymes required to make copies of the viruss genome, and the viruss famous spike protein.
The spike protein is what the coronaviruses use to grab ahold of host cellsthat is, human cells they infect or the cells of any other animal victim. Once the virus latches on with its spike protein, it gets into the cell and hijacks the cell's activities, forcing it to help manufacture viral clones, which then burst forth to infect more cells.
There are many copies of the spike protein on the outer surface of coronaviruses, creating a spikey exteriorthink a cartoon sea mine. The pointy adornments are actually what give coronaviruses their name. Under an electron microscope, the spikes give the viral particle a crown-like appearance, hence corona viruses. But more importantly, the spike proteins are a prime target for antibodies. And, because we have the whole genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2, researchers have a good start at figuring out effective ways to engineer vaccines to attack the spike proteins and other critical components of the virus.
Vaccine platforms
There are many ways to try to train the immune system to fight off a specific germ or specific elements of germs, such as SARS-CoV-2 or the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Here are the general categories currently in play:
Live-attenuated vaccine: These vaccines use whole viruses that are weakened so they can no longer cause disease. This is a well-established method for creating vaccines. In the past, researchers weakened viruses by growing them in lab conditions for long periods of timewhich is a bit like domesticating germs. The cushy, all-inclusive petri-dish lifestyle can essentially allow viruses and bacteria to adapt to their tranquil surroundings and lose virulence over time. But, it can take a while. Scientists grew the measles virus in lab conditions for nearly 10 years before using it for a live-attenuated vaccine in the early 1960s.
Nowadays, there are faster, more controlled approaches to engineer weakened viruses, such as targeted mutations and other manipulations of a viruss genetic code.
Live-attenuated virus vaccines have the advantage of generating the same variety of protective antibodies as a real infectionwithout causing a pesky, life-threatening disease, for the most part. But there are risks. Because the virus can still replicate, certain people (particularly those with immunodeficiencies) may have severe reactions. Though the newer strategies for weakening viruses may reduce these risks, they still require extensive safety testing before reaching the market.
That said, this is a vaccine platform that has already proven successful. Several vaccines in use are live-attenuated vaccines, including vaccines for chickenpox and typhoid. If such a vaccine proved effective at preventing COVID-19, we already have the know-how and infrastructure to quickly scale up production to make these vaccines.
Inactivated vaccine: This is another straightforward, old-school method that uses whole viruses. In this case, the viruses are effectively dead, though, usually inactivated by heat or chemicals. These corpse viruses can still prime the immune system to make neutralizing antibodies; they just do it less efficiently.
The advantage of this strategy is that it is relatively simple to make these types of vaccines and, because the viruses dont replicate, there is no risk of infection and less risk of severe reactions. Disadvantages include that inactivated, non-replicating viruses dont illicit as strong of an immune response as a disease-causing or weakened virus. Inactivated vaccines always require multiple doses and may need periodic booster shots as well.
Like weakened virus vaccines, using a whole viral particle gives the immune system many potential viral targets for antibodies. Some may be good targets to neutralize a real infection, and some may not. But, using an inactivated virus is a proven method. For instance, some existing vaccines against polio, hepatitis A, and rabies use this method.
Viral vector-based vaccine: For these vaccines, researchers take a weakened or harmless virus and engineer it to contain an element of a dangerous virus they want to protect against.
In the context of COVID-19, this might mean engineering a harmless virus to produce, say, the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. This way you get the immune response to a live but benign virus, coupled with the likelihood of having antibodies that target a specific critical protein from the dangerous SARS-CoV-2.
This, too, is a proven strategy for effective vaccines. The newly approved Ebola vaccine, for instance, uses this method.
Subunit vaccines: These are bare-bones vaccines that include only a component of a dangerous virus to elicit immune responses. For COVID-19 vaccines, the spike protein isno surprisea popular candidate.
Subunits can be delivered in formulations with adjuvantsaccessory ingredients that can enhance immune responses. One common adjuvant is alum, an aluminum salt, long known to be useful for vaccines. Some newer subunit vaccines come in snappier packages, however. These include artificial virus-like particles (VLPs) and nanoparticles.
Subunit vaccines are already an established vaccine platform. The HPV vaccine in use involves a VLP that feeds the immune system proteins from the HPVs outer shellwhich can then be targeted by antibodies.
RNA and DNA vaccines: These are among the newest types of vaccinesand among the shakiest. There are currently no licensed vaccines that use this method. But researchers are optimistic about their potential.
The basic idea is to deliver genetic material of a viruseither in the form of DNA or RNAdirectly to human cells, which are then somehow compelled to translate that genetic code into viral proteins and then able to make antibodies against those.
Some of the details of how these candidate vaccines work are proprietary and unproven, so its difficult to assess how likely they are to succeed or how easy it will be to scale up vaccine production if they are successful."

Despite disruptions to both supply and demand caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Apple posted $58.3 billion in revenue in its second quarter, eking out 1 percent growth over last year's second quarter.
This beat some recent expectations by investors, but it falls well behind the $63-67 billion guidance for the quarter the company initial gave before the coronavirus' effects were fully felt. Apple's retail stores have been closed around much of the world, and for a period of time earlier this year, its ability to assemble iPhones and other products was hampered as the virus first spread in China.
CEO Tim Cook spoke optimistically about the company's long-term prospects on a call with investors today, but in a break with common practice, Apple did not provide guidance for the next quarter, citing the inability to predict the pandemic's future impact. ""We have great confidence in the long-term of our business,"" Cook said. ""In the short-term, it's hard to see out the windshield to know what the next 60 days look like, and so we're not giving guidance because of that lack of visibility and uncertainty.""The tentpole achievement of this quarter was $13.3 billion in services revenue, up $2.2 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago. Services includes things like Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News. Along with wearables, services have been the company's primary focus in a strategy to make up for slowing iPhone revenue growth.
iPhone revenue was $28.96 billion, wearables pulled in $10.01 billion, Mac $5.35 billion, and iPad $4.36 billion. Apple executives noted that a significant portion of Mac buyers were new to the platform, and that the company's overall global install base has reached a new high.
Speaking of the company's financials amidst the pandemic, Cook said, ""There was a significant, very steep fall-off in February. That began to recover some in March, and we've seen further recovery in April. So, it leaves us room for optimism.""It felt as if he spent at least as much time on the call talking about efforts by the company to combat the pandemic directly as he did discussing the business. That included the design and mass-production of face shields, the sourcing of protective masks, 2:1 donation matching for employees, and other initiatives. He spoke briefly about Apple's commitment to contribute $350 billion to developing the US economy. Also, Apple is proceeding with plans to buy back more of its stock from investors with its considerable cash reserves.
It was an unusual earnings call for an unusual time. Cook seemed to think so, too. ""It was a very unique quarter,"" he said. ""I've never had anything quite like this. I hope to never have it again, but I'm incredibly proud of the company and what was achieved during that period of time.""
Apple's stock was down several points in after-hours trading following the call."

Over the past month, seemingly spontaneous protest sites have popped up throughout the country that advocate for an end to lockdowns various states have mandated in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now, security researchers have tied much of this seemingly grass-roots activity to a single person.
Aaron Dorr is a well-known activist and lobbyist who has long been known for his advocacy of firearms ownership. Over a five-hour span on April 8, he registered six domainsreopenohio.com, reopenpa.com, reopenmn.com, reopeniowa.com, reopenwyoming.com, and reopenmissouri.comand nine days later purchased reopentxnow.com.
He and his brothers then used a variety of state-specific Facebook groups, which according the the Des Moines Register have a total of more than 200,000 followers, to drive massive amounts of traffic to the newly registered addresses. In turn, the domains redirected visitors to a host of state-specific gun advocacy sites, such as Iowa Gun Owners. Each gun ownership site used a different organization name and prominently displayed banners decrying the lockdowns in their respective states.
The various groups seemed loosely affiliated and seem to be run by different people in each state, but tie back to a Mr. Aaron Dorr, researchers with Internet analysis tool provider DomainTools wrote in an analysis published on Friday. As we looked further we would find that this is more of a small groups astroturfing effort.
At least 13 of the firearms coalition sites are maintained with website tools provided by One Click Politics, which describes itself as a nonpartisan online advocacy site. The tools allow a single person to create and manage content, run email campaigns, and raise money on multiple sites. All of the sites also use the WordPress content management system that are set up in a similar manner and often carry almost identical language. Although the sites domain registrants were obscured through a proxy service, it appeared all of the sites were run by the same person or entity.
Then the DomainTools researchers found something else. The site at iowagunowners.org, a domain that was registered in 2007, listed a contact phone number that was included in an Iowa state lobbyist report completed by Dorr. The researchers also discovered that historical HTTPS certificates for all of the sites referenced Dorrs personal site, as well as gun coalitions in other states.
Another similarity among the gun ownership sites: they all use a donate button provided by Anedot, a donation site for churches, charities and non-profit organizations. Almost all of the configurations for the buttons are identical.
We can say that these initial domains and the campaign behind them are definitely a small group-run astroturfing effort and that the Dorrs plan to continue operating these nation-wide campaigns, the DomainTools report said.
Friday's report came four days after KrebsOnSecurity also linked several of the sites to Dorr. Reporter Brian Krebs said that at least two of the gun ownership sites included the same Google Analytics tracker in their source code. The same tracker was present on reopentexasnow.com, reopenwi.com, reopeniowa.com and several anti-gun control sites registered to the Dorr brothers.
Dorr declined to answer questions for this post or to provide a statement. A text message he sent me contained a link the the previously mentioned Des Moines Register article. The article quotes Dorr saying: This virus has claimed the lives of (0.002%) of the states population, while sending over 160,000 Iowans into horrific financial devastation. Our members asked for a vehicle with which to make their voices heard, and we are happy to give them that voice."""

It may sound unsettling or even downright creepy for the device thats generally with you 24/7 to make it possible for authorities to trace your exposure to a potentially fatal illness thats currently consuming the world. Thats why Apple and Google have been bending over backward to provide privacy assurances about the platform-compatible programming interfaces theyre putting into iOS and Android. On Monday, they offered new details, as well as images of the push notifications users might receive should they have come into contact with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19.
Among the assurances provided is that apps that use the application programming interfaces can only be developed by or for public health authorities and that the limited amount of information they can collect may be used solely for tracing COVID-19 infections. Apps will be barred from seeking location permissions and must collect the least amount of data possible to trace the physical contacts of other opt-in app users who later find out theyre infected. None of the data collected may be used for any commercial purposes.
Besides the assurances, the companies gave a sneak peak of the permissions users must provide and the look of push exposure notifications to be delivered to a users phone. Here are the images:

Effective but risky (and costly)
Health experts have said that contact tracingor the process of tracing all the people an infected person has come into physical contact with over the previous 14 daysis one of the most effective ways to contain exposure to the novel coronavirus. Once identified, people exposed can be monitored or go into quarantine for the next two weeks.
To date, US and worldwide infections have reached 1.2 million and 3.6 million, respectively, with 68,000 and 1.2 million deaths. The Trump administration recently projected deaths in this country would range from 100,000 to 200,000.
While contact tracing is one of the best hopes for keeping the numbers as low as possible, its extremely time and work intensive, since it traditionally requires large numbers of health workers to perform interviews. The practice is also prone to error and uncertainty because the people being interviewed have faulty memories and can only report contacts with others who are known to the infected person.
Phone apps could provide a much more efficient and accurate means of tracing that was never available during previous pandemics. But it comes with potentially dystopian side effects unless developersof apps and in particular of the interfaces that the apps callarent designed with care. Apple and Google intend the details provided on Monday to ensure developers with both companies are carefully using those considerations to fully inform the platform theyre building.
In all, the details provided during a conference call with reporters on Monday included the following, although some of them repeated assurances offered last month, when the APIs were first announced.<ul><li>Apps must be created by or for a government public health authority and can only be used for COVID-19 response efforts.</li><li>Apps must require full user consent before they can use the exposure notification API.</li><li>Apps must require users to consent before sharing a positive test result, and the Diagnosis Keys associated with their devices, with the public health authority.</li><li>Apps should collect only the minimum amount of data necessary and can only use that data for COVID-19 response efforts. All other uses of user data, including targeting advertising, is not permitted.</li><li>Apps are prohibited from seeking permission to access Location Services.</li><li>Use of the API will be restricted to one app per country to promote high user adoption and avoid fragmentation. If a country has opted for a regional or state approach, the companies are prepared to support those authorities.</li></ul>Caution and criticism
Privacy advocates have received the initiative with mixed results, with some experts saying they are cautiously optimistic and others saying the project is doomed to exposing sensitive infections, locations, contacts, and other sensitive information, possibly at an unprecedented scale. The companies have already built the interfaces into beta versions of their mobile operating systems and plan to make them available in general releases later this month.
The newly provided images suggest that the push messages will reveal the date or dates the contact took place. They also illustrate the permissions users must provide to opt in to the system. Its still too early to determine if the health benefits of contact-tracing apps in always-on, always-have devices will outweigh the privacy risks. Apple and Google say they wont and are trying to provide evidence for that claim."

Evidence is stacking up to support a link between COVID-19 and a rare, mysterious inflammatory disease in children, which can be life-threatening.
Though reports of the new disease have trickled in from several countries, many of them have been anecdotal to this point. Now, doctors in an area of Italy hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic have published detailed data on a cluster of 10 children who experienced an unusual inflammatory disease amid the outbreak, lending solid support for the link. Their report appeared Wednesday in The Lancet.
The doctors describe the condition they saw as Kawasaki-like, referring to a rare disease in children that causes inflammation of blood vessels. Kawasaki diseaseidentified in Japan in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasakiis typically marked by sustained fever, rash, swelling of hands and feet, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. In the worst cases, it can lead to heart problems and aneurisms.
Despite being identified decades ago, Kawaskis cause still remains unclear. Researchers have widely hypothesized that infectious agentslike virusestrigger berserk immune responses in certain children with genetic predispositions. But no single germy culprit or genetic factors have been firmly nailed down. As such, its still unclear who will end up afflicted by the condition. Researchers have only determined that Kawaski primarily strikes children younger than five, often boys, and often people of Asian and Pacific Island descent.
Since the pandemic began, there have been scattered reports of an uptick in cases with a disease similar to Kawasaki in children. The cases seem linked to outbreaks of COVID-19. However, they dont always fit the classic definitions of Kawasaki.
In the new Lancet study, the Italian doctors offer a clear connection between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the Kawasaki-like disease. They also lay out in detail how the cases they saw differ from the classic forms of the disease, laying the groundwork for a COVID-19-specific form of the disease.
Surprising spike
To do that, the doctors reviewed medical records of children who were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease between January 1, 2015, and April 20, 2020, at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy. At the time of the study, the city of Bergamo had the highest rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Italy, which was ravaged by the pandemic.
The doctors identified only 29 cases in that time frame, 19 of which were diagnosed between January 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. The other 10 were identified between February 18 and April 20, 2020, as the COVID-19 outbreak raged. The spike during the outbreak represents a thirtyfold increase in incidence of the inflammatory condition.
The doctors suspected that all 10 of the Kawasaki cases during the outbreak had been infected with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. But only eight of the children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which are Y-shaped proteins made by the immune system to fight off the virus. The presence of the antibodies means that the children had been infected. The doctors suspect that the other two children were false negatives. One, for instance, had received a treatment of immunoglobulin, which may have interfered with the antibody test.
They also noted that previous studies done in 2005 and 2014 had also linked coronavirusesin these cases, ones that cause seasonal coldsto Kawasaki disease. Though other studies failed to find such a link, the authors argued that, together, this suggests that the coronavirus family might represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 being a particularly virulent strain able to elicit a powerful immune response in the host.
The presence of the virus in nearly all of the cases during the outbreak and the fact that the spike in inflammatory cases has a clear starting point after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in our area, convinced the doctors.
All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients, they concluded.
Mounting mysteries
But the doctors noted that the inflammatory disease was slightly different than the cases seen in the past. The children afflicted during the outbreak tended to be older, with an average age of 7.5, compared with the 19 pre-COVID cases, which had an average age of 3.
The outbreak cases also had more severe diseases. Six of the 10 had heart complications, compared with just two of the 19 cases from the pre-COVID era. Two outbreak cases had signs of toxic shock, which was not seen in any of the earlier cases. Finally, eight of the outbreak cases needed additional steroid treatments to recover, which was only needed in three of the pre-COVID cases.
Ultimately, the doctors were careful to call the cases seen during the outbreak a Kawaski-like disease.
In an accompanying editorial, Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics, and Elizabeth Whittaker, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Imperial College London, tried to tease this apart. They write: These differences raise the question as to whether this cluster is Kawasaki disease with SARS-CoV-2 as the triggering agent, or represents an emerging Kawasaki-like disease characterised by multisystem inflammation.
Like the Italian doctors, they highlight thathowever frighteningthis inflammatory disease is still rare, likely affecting no more than one in 1,000 children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Parents and doctors should be aware of it but also keep in mind that children are minimally affected by COVID-19 overall.
But, Viner and Whittaker note, that insight into whats going on with immune responses in this rare condition could help explain other mysteries of the illness.
Understanding this inflammatory phenomenon in children might provide vital information about immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and possible correlates of immune protection that might have relevance both for adults and children. In particular, if this is an antibody-mediated phenomenon, there might be implications for vaccine studies, and this might also explain why some children become very ill with COVID-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic."

Look, we're admittedly biased around the Ars Orbital HQ. Whether the best of times or worst of times, we routinely find comfort in a good book. COVID-19 has changed so much about our day-to-day lives, including some of our entertainment habits around things like gaming or streaming TV and film. But when it comes to precious reading time in between work and busy personal lives, we're continually drawn to the stories that grip usas grim as some of those may be.
This year's staff summer recommendation/To Be Read list has a few newer releases, plenty of old classics, and a lot of alternate reality/sci-fi. Ars' book tastes remain nothing if not on-brand, meaning we may never get through one of these without Douglas Adams being mentioned. Here's everything, Hitchhiker's Guides and others, we've been escaping to.
Enlarge/The Collapsing Empire, by John Scalzi
Series starters
Sci-fi fans who enjoy engaging characters and story driven more by human interaction than technical wharrgarbl will enjoy John Scalzi's latest trilogy, The Interdependency. The third book just released last week, and it ties things up neatlya first, for Scalzi. The Interdependency is an old-school galaxy-spanning empire, with a twisthabitable planets are almost impossibly difficult to find, and in an effort to curtail war, the Interdependency was designed so that no system can survive without trade with the others.
This arrangement is fine, until systems begin being inexorablyand permanentlycutting off from access to one another, heralding a collapse of civilization itself. Scalzi lightly channels the kind of wry humor the late, great Douglas Adams was best known for, though never going over-the-top into outright comedy.
If you're looking for something a little further off the beaten path, I've also been enjoying a series called The Murderbot Diaries, by Martha Wells. I'm only a couple of books into the five-book series, but Wells' description of a confused rogue AI in a cyborg body, with absolutely everything designed, maintained, and forcibly supplied by the lowest bidder, is both charming and engaging. The Murderbot has its own desires, needs, and goalsit's just not too clear what those are, beyond doing as half-assed a job as possible in order to leave more time for trashy soap-opera consumption.Jim Salter, Technology Reporter
Sci-fi, lots of sci-fi
I read, um, kind of a lotbetween 50 and 100 novels a year, most yearsand I'm always happy to talk books. In these quarantimes, leaning in and running away seem to be the two big categories in my reading. Sticking to books that were published in the last decade (so leaving out annual comfort re-reads of Lloyd Alexander and Terry Pratchett), I have some thoughts.
If you like motley crews in space: Becky Chambers's Wayfarer series, starting with The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. Chambers's books are optimistic, character-driven science fiction; stories about people and how they feel in a strange and exciting future. Soft and cozy reading.
Just this week I also finished the two books to date in Alex White's Salvagers series, starting with A Big Ship at the Edge of the Universe. Motley crew of talented space pirates, but also with magic and a set of moral codes. Zippy reading, genuine fun.
If you like cities: I cannot recommend N.K. Jemisin's latest, The City We Became, highly enough, especially if you love cities and double especially if you've spent any time in New York. I haven't lived in New York City since 2008, and I still could smell and feel and hear every single page. Cities have souls, and this is their story.
If you liked Hidden Figures: Mary Robinette Kowal's Lady Astronaut books, The Calculating Stars and The Fated Sky. As a Washington, DC, resident, I didn't love my home being wiped off the map at the start of the apocalypse, but for all that a story of doom kicks off the tale, it is optimistic, Right Stuff spacefaring fiction at its finest.
And if you really want to lean into the apocalypse: Chuck Wendig's Wanderers poses a pandemic from an animal-borne virus striking humanity right against the landscape of a US presidential election year. It's the wrong book to read in our actual 2020 if you're prone to giving yourself nightmares, but it's still a very good book.Kate Cox, Tech Policy Reporter
Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams are among the executive producers of HBO's Lovecraft Country.
Two greats set in the past
Now is the perfect time to read Lovecraft Country, the 2016 dark fantasy/horror novel by Matt Ruff, since HBO's adapted series will debut in August. Set in the Jim Crow era of the 1950s, it's structured almost as a series of short stories, although everything is inter-related and hangs together beautifully as a whole. The first quarter focuses on Atticus, a black Korean war veteran and big H.P. Lovecraft fan, despite the author's notorious racism. When his estranged father disappears, leaving a cryptic message, Atticus sets out on a road trip from Chicago's South Side to rural Massachusetts. He's accompanied by his Uncle Georgepublisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guideand his childhood friend Letitia.
There are plenty of sly references to the works of Lovecraft for the astute reader, as we encounter a secret cabal called the Order of the Ancient Dawn, a haunted house, a strange pocket universe, time shifting, shape-shifters, an evil mannequin, and a cursed book. What makes the book so ingeniously subversive, however, is that the worst monsters are not eldritch terrors or a Shoggoth in the woods; it's the stark racism and bigotry our protagonists encounter along the way.
Beyond that, I've got one other recommendation: Iain Pears' sprawling 1997 novel, An Instance of the Fingerpost. Part historical murder mystery, part philosophical rumination on the unreliability of human memory and personal narrativesaka the ""Rashomon effect"" after Akira Kurosawa's classic 1950 film the novel remains one of my all-time favorite reads that I return to every few years. The title refers to a quote from Francis Bacon, who held that all evidence is fallible, and yet there can be ""one instance of a fingerpost that points in one direction only, and allows of no other possibility.""
Pears is a former BBC reporter who garnered early success with his art-history mysteries featuring fictional detective/art historian Jonathan Argyll. Those novels are light and quite fun, but with Fingerpost, Pears attains a whole new level of thematic complexity. It's almost as if he started out writing a simple tale of a 17th-century Oxford murder, only to be carried away as that world and its denizens came alive for him. It's been justly compared to Umberto Eco's 1980 bestselling novel The Name of the Rose, although I prefer Fingerpost.
This was a tumultuous period of enlightenment, when new scientific ideas were flourishing and conflicting with religious institutions, and political intrigue was everywhere. There are four sections, each narrated by a different character, each remembering their version of the 1663 arsenic poisoning of a man named Robert Grove many years later. A servant girl confessed, but the four witnessesan Italian physician, the son of an alleged Royalist traitor, a cryptographer, and an Oxford archivisteach identified a different culprit, and only one will ultimately reveal the truth about what really happened. Pears masterfully evokes Restoration England, as Charles II regained the throne after Oliver Cromwell's short-lived attempt at a republic, and his characters (historical figures and fictional ones) are richly detailed. It's a long book but so riveting that you'll be tempted to devour it as fast as possible, and you'll be pondering the nature of truth entirely by the end.Jennifer Ouellette, Senior Writer"

Every week now seems to bring news of another Hollywood project being delayed. Sometimes this is because you can't make money in an empty theater, but it's just as often due to production halts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of that industry hits pause for now, one crucial segment has notthe writers. Like many of us, they've instead become intimately familiar with the inner workings of on-the-job Zoom calls. 
""I kind of feel for every aspiring TV writer at home right now due to the pandemic,"" said Sera Gamble, showrunner of Netflix's You (formerly of Supernatural and The Magicians), during this year's online-only edition of the ATX TV Festival. ""They're trying to write while doing a bunch of other stuff; well, congrats, you're now in showrunner training. I've frequently had to sit down in the past and rewrite a script in a moment that felt like a severe crisis, and sometimes it was a severe crisis. But it feels like that times 10. I have to reset expectations every morning: I wake up, wait a minute before checking my phone, check in with loved ones, and then take the problems of the day as they come... [I tell my writers] 'You can't solve what you can't solve, so what can we get done in the next hour?'""
For this late-addition panel to this year's ATX TV Festival, Gamble (virtually) joined Dan Goor(Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Parks and Rec),Melinda Hsu Taylor(Nancy Drew, Lost), and Beth Schwartz (Sweet Tooth, Arrow) to take streamers ""Inside the Writers (Zoom) Room."" For some, the change came abruptly. Hsu Taylor and her staff had nearly completed both writing and production on the latest season of Nancy Drew when suddenly they had to convert everything to be remote-friendly (she credits doing a Zoom birthday for her son around that time for helping her grasp the basic logistics and experience). Other writers started wholesale in a digital world, like the staff of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. They were five weeks into story-breaking at the time of this panel and hadn't been together in-person at all while working on the upcoming season eight.
No one had a choice, of course. As COVID-19 continues to surge in the United Statesthe country passed the 2-million-case mark within the last two weeksall walks of life must adjust. And when any in-person interactions come with potentially life-threatening risk for the foreseeable future, suddenly Zoom calls sound downright preferable.
""Right when we went home, there was a little bit of a relief,"" Gamble said. ""We were social distancing in two separate rooms for weeks before we went home just so people could have six to 10 feet between them. At one point, I asked a writer's assistant to track how often 'coronavirus' was saidit was every two minutes. So at least if we went home, we'd be able to work.""
The work
Logistically, certain things have been trickier for TV writers in this shared Zoom existence. Larger writers' rooms pushing 10 people or more may have difficulty translating into a single Zoom chat, where not talking over each other and reading the room become harder. So, You and Brooklyn Nine-Nine now opt to have multiple, smaller Zoom calls focused on more narrowly defined tasks, and only the showrunner will hop between conversations. That magic writers often like to refer tothe creative spark, the inner-staff interactions where a lunch convo might solve a plot problem later that afternoonhas also proven harder to recreate in these digital work spaces.View more stories
""It's more efficient, but it is weird and less fun,"" Goor said. ""There's less joking around. We did every possible Zoom joke we could do that first weekchanged all the backgrounds, mine was my mom's water colors. We did background videos of each other... so I guess we found new ways to waste time, now that I think about... But it's nice to feel a reaction to a pitch, and it's much harder to do that over Zoom. I find myself talking myself out of story ideas.""
Early on at least, Zoom has also surprised writers with a few positive benefits. In writers' rooms where some staffers have been with a show much longer than others, Zoom may take away some unspoken hierarchical barriers and put everyone on equal footing. ""There's something democratizing about these squares that are always present and equally sized,"" Goor said. ""For new people, it might be easier to speak up now. 'Oh, and April, what do you have to say about this?'"" Zoom also inherently leads to less workday interruption: fewer bathroom breaks, less losing the room to endless joke-offs, and skipping longer lunch routines like the Brooklyn Nine-Nine staff's elaborate Wheel of Fortune-style approach to selecting takeout.
But perhaps the biggest change? The pandemic has given everyone in the writers' room a more holistic perspective on lifeepisode four of season whatever no longer gets to be anyone's most important thing. Add it all up, and many writers now have a much more traditional work day.
""Comedy hours are usually bad, and they've become so much better,"" Goor said, noting how he now typically works 10am to 12:30pm, takes lunch, and resumes from 1:30p to 5:30p. ""Routinely for the first few seasons, we'd eat dinner [in the writers' room] and be there till 8pm or 10pm or 11pm for a table read. We've adjusted. It's partly because it's impossible to look at Zoom for that long, but it's partly so people can be with their families, be healthy, and experience life.""
Focusing at home versus when you're physically in a space for a specific task can be a new challenge, but these TV writers continue to find approaches that work for individual groups. Hsu Taylor and the Nancy Drew staff start each session with a three-minute meditation to intentionally tell their minds that work time has begun. ""I know some people are checking their email because I hear clicking,"" she said. ""But I think most like this. 'OK, I'm doing this now.' I'm telling my mind and body to be here for the next few hours."" And some former tasks that would force writers to split their attention now don't exist, like having to be on set for script tweaks during an episode you may have written.
""With production being down,"" Schwartz said, ""you can really focus on the scripts instead of being all over the place.""

The end product
Whether good or bad, our new reality has absolutely already impacted what we'll eventually see on screen. You, for instance, centers on a bookstore manager creepily obsessed with an aspiring young writer. To put it succinctly, the show frequently has characters at least kissing. But for the upcoming season three, that may be one aspect needing to change, no questions asked.
""We can't put people in dangerTV shows aren't worth that,"" said Gamble. ""So we'll change what we can and keep an eye on the lines we don't want to cross. We won't do the show and have it be shitty because there was a pandemic. We'll be measured and try to maintain the spirits of the show. But it's a conversation, scene by scene by scene.""
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates shifts in logistics, too. Where you can film and who can you film obviously feeds into what scenes a writing staff can write. The writers noted productions in Canada and New Zealand, like Nancy Drew and Sweet Tooth, will happen first since those countries have navigated COVID-19 better than the US. And with mandated quarantine for travelers to those places, local actors could have a leg up for roles, too.
For Goor and the Brooklyn Nine-Nine team, new logistical concerns start with babies. No explicit spoilers, but two characters had one last season, and the team suddenly has to look at animatronics and maybe less overall on-screen infant time (""There's going to be a run on those bespoke fake babies,"" Gamble joked).
""It's hard, because we're doing stories on the work-life balance for these people. This goes in so many different directions and we still don't know where [the pandemic] is going, so it's hard to write for it,"" Goor said. ""Is it safe to shoot outside? Originally, we wanted everything to be a bottle episode, so we can shoot on the stages, [and] it'll be controlled. But now, is it better to do all exteriors? Because it seems like it's healthier and safer for people. How many extras can you have? Can you use kids? And since there will be waves of productions, with movies and pilots starting, too, availability for guest cast will be a lot harder. Five-episode guest-star arcs are now harder.""
All these decisions ultimately bleed into the business of TV, too. For writers, maybe the option of participating in a writer's room remotely suddenly becomes more commonplace, democratizing the career for people outside of NYC and LA (and those cities' sky-high rents). And not having to commute regularly or be in one physical space would mean writers' rooms could welcome writers with physical disabilities more easily, thus bringing wider perspectives to a host of shows.
""I think there's a reason we do [in-person writers' rooms], and it's not just to spend studio money on all that rentit's good for creativity and production,"" says Gamble. ""But it will be easier to say, 'We should just meet on Zoom on some days.' And for the disabled community, if an agent were to call and pitch me somebody and explain why someone could rarely or never be on set, well, I know that works now. If this all leads to a crop of great writers breaking into the business, that excites me.""

On the heels of criticism from President Trump, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to release updated guidance documents outlining how schools can safely reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Vice President Mike Pence announced the upcoming documents Wednesday, just hours after Trump took to Twitter to blast the agencys current guidelines.
Well, the president said today, we just dont want the guidance to be too tough, Pence said in a press briefing for the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Thats the reason why next week, the CDC is going to be issuing a new set of tools, five different documents that will be giving even more clarity on the guidance going forward.
In tweets, Trump said he disagreed with the CDCs guidelines, calling them very tough &amp; expensive. He also threatened to cut funding to schools that refused to open before the November election.
However, as NPR notes, schools on average receive 10 percent or less of their funding from the federal government, and those funds are typically aimed at supporting children with disabilities and those from low-income households. Further, Pence clarified during the press briefing that the White House would be ""very respectful"" if ""certain limitations prevent some school districts from reopening.
Confusion
Its unclear which CDC guidelines or recommendations the president was criticizing. However, existing documents recommend that administrators consider closing schools for extended periods of time if there is substantial community transmission of COVID-19which there currently is in many parts of the country.
In todays press briefing, Pence emphasized that the agencys guidelines should be tailored for each area and should not replace local or state rules or guidance. CDC Director Robert Redfield appeared alongside Pence and noted that the CDCs recommendations were not intended to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed.
The Trump administration is not alone in urging schools to reopen. On June 26, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its interim guidance, saying that it strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. The organization noted that schools provide fundamental roles in academic instruction, social and emotional skills, safety, nutrition, physical activity, and mental health therapy. As such, it argued that the benefits to children of having schools open for in-person learning may outweigh risks.
But many teachers and parents are still wary of in-person learning. In many school buildings and classrooms, social distancing measures are difficult if not impossible to follow. And chronic underfunding has left buildings with poor ventilation.
Parents and teachers
On Tuesday, six groups representing teachers and parents released a statement saying that Without a comprehensive plan that includes federal resources to provide for the safety of our students and educators with funding for Personal Protective Equipment, socially distanced instruction, and addressing racial inequity, we could be putting students, their families, and educators in danger.
The statement went on to note that the administration has failed to provide leadership on preparing schools and has provided conflicting and confusing guidance.
The issuance of a new set of guidance documents may not provide clarity. Despite the lack of a clear plan while the disease surges in many areas, President Trump has intensified his calls for schools to reopen. On Tuesday, he vowed to pressure states to reopen schools in the fall, which could have a significant impact on the economy and the election."

For several weeks in March, Arinjay Banerjee would eat breakfast at 6am and then drive the empty roads of Toronto to a restricted-access lab. Then hed ready himself for work, donning three layers of gloves, a helmeted mask kitted with an air-purifying respirator, and a surgical-style gown.
The interlocked doors and special filtered ventilation system of the lab, fitted with alarms should air circulation malfunction, are designed to stop outward air flow. After eight hours at the bench, Banerjee would put aside his scrubs and boot covers for sterilization, change out of his work sneakers and return to a basement apartment in the home of a colleague.
The stringent conditions in that Toronto labonly one level below the most secure in the biosafety hierarchywere crucial. Banerjee, a virologist, was on a team working to isolate the SARS-CoV-2 virus from one of the first patients in Canada. As the pandemic unfolded, he almost felt safer suited up in the containment lab than he did when out in the world.
The team was pushing to isolate the virus so they could get a jump on vaccine development. Banerjee was the bat guy. He had expertise in biosafety lab work and experience in isolating dangerous pathogens. He had studied how bats interact with viruses like the one that causes MERS, one of hundreds of coronaviruses that the mammals can harbor.
Bats have become newly infamous as reservoirs of deadly viruses. In addition to hosting an ancestral version of the MERS virus, which has caused repeated outbreaks in people, bats also harbor very close relatives of the ones that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak and todays COVID-19 pandemic. They are natural hosts for Hendra, Nipah and Marburg virusesall of which can be deadly in peopleand they are the suspected reservoir of the Ebola virus that has killed thousands in multiple outbreaks in Africa.
Bats can also host a diverse range of influenza viruses as well as relatives of the human-infecting hepatitis C virus. And research suggests that some viruses that today infect only people, like measles and mumps, had their evolutionary origins in bats.
Yet despite the long list of bat-dwelling viruses, the animals dont seem to be bothered by their many invisible inhabitants. And scientists want to know why. Today, a growing number of them suspect that the key lies in special features of the bat immune systemones that spark responses to viral invasion that are very different from what goes on in people. Its very intriguing, Banerjee says. I wake up thinking about it every day. Why do bats have this immune response thats so different from ours and so different from other mammals?
Of course, many viruses exist in wildlife, often causing little harm to their natural hosts and only making trouble for us when they manage to jump to human beings or other creatures with which they dont share a long evolutionary history. Ducks and other water birds muck about while carrying myriad strains of influenza A; pigs arent fazed by hosting hepatitis E. But bats appear to be special, if only in the number of high-profile viruses that they carry and appear to tolerate.
Before COVID-19 came along, scientists already were piecing together some of the peculiarities of the bat-virus relationship. That research has taken on new urgency. And it raises an intriguing possibility. If we better understand how bats tolerate their viral passengersby stepping up activity of one immune protein, say, or dialing down activity of anotherwe might better understand how viral infections proceed in people. That, in turn, might point to treatments that could make infections in people less severe.
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we could learn from what evolution has developed in a bat, where the outcome is not disease but its something that enables survival upon infection with a particular virus, says cellular immunologist Judith Mandl of McGill University in Montreal. If we figure that out, then maybe we can apply the same principles and modulate the immune response in humans.
The impressive ability of bats to ward off disease has long been remarked upon. A 1932 scholarly note on fruit bats in Australia states, No reliable evidence of the occurrence of epidemics among the fruit-bat population was discovered. And a 1957 paper on the southeastern myotis bat notes that disease is apparently unimportant.... During the course of this study, which involved observations on over a million bats in every known cave colony in Florida, I have never found a dead bat, and have seen only one which appeared diseased.
Certainly, bats in the United States are in trouble today: The Eurasian fungus behind white nose syndrome has been killing large numbers of many bat species for more than a decade. But with few exceptionsincluding rabies and the more obscure Tacaribe viruswhen bats get infected with viruses they dont appear to get sick.
There seems to be no pathology associated with these infectionsno clinical signs associated. They can remain in good health and display no discernible signs of disease, says Raina Plowright, an infectious disease ecologist and wildlife veterinarian at Montana State University in Bozeman who coauthored a new review on bats and viruses.
When a host, whether bat or human, is infected with a disease-causing pathogen, the ensuing interaction is often described as a battle: The hosts immune system pulls out the big guns to fight and eradicate the invader. In immunology parlance, this is known as resistance; its end game is destroying the pathogen.
But theres a growing appreciation of the importance of disease tolerance, a keep calm and carry on approach in which the immune system limits collateral damage to the host but doesnt worry about getting rid of every trace of a pathogen. And several recent studies suggest that this tolerance model captures how bats interact with many of the viruses they carry.
Many details are missing: There are some 1,300 bat speciesthey are the second largest order of mammals, outnumbered only by rodentsand studies typically focus on one or a handful. But a rough picture is emerging. Research suggests that the bat immune system deals with marauding viral invaders in two key ways: First, the bats mount a speedy but nuanced offensive that stops the virus from multiplying with abandon. Second, and perhaps more important, they dial down the activity of immune foot soldiers that might otherwise cause a massive inflammatory response that would do more damage than the virus itself.
Bats have a lot of this good immune responsesuppressing virus replicationthat protects them, Banerjee says. And they have very little of the not-so-good immune response, which is inflammation.
Key players in this two-part bat immune response are interferons, small signaling molecules that got their name because of their talent for interfering with virus replication. Theyre a first line of defense for mammals in general: When cells are infected by viruses, they release various interferons as an alarm signal, as do some immune system cells.
But bats seem to go one better. To start with, some species have an outsize number of genes for making interferons: Large flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have dozens of genes for making even just one kind, called type 1 interferons; the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus), a natural host of Marburg virus, has 46 (humans have about 20).
Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) seem to use another strategy: In this speciesas well as the lesser short-nosed fruit bat ( Cynopterus brachyotis)some genes for making interferons are always turned on, even when theres no viral invader to contend with. In the black flying foxes, these always on interferons, among other things, kick-start production of an enzyme that chops up viral genetic material.
Black flying foxes and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) have yet another trick up their wings. They have an extra-strong version of a protein whose job is to flip the on switch for some interferon genes. Experiments by Banerjee and colleagues using genetically altered human and bat cells found that in either kind of cell, the bat protein was better than the human version at keeping viral numbers down after exposure to a cousin of the rabies virus.
Bats, in other words, seem to have multiple layers of interferon protection: one that stands at the ready to quickly curtail viral replication, and another, more standard-issue one that ramps up activity after a viral invader has appeared. But its not just a blunt one-two punch. The sheer number of interferon genes some bats have hints at a flexible, more nuanced response.
Having many, many copies of a gene presents opportunities, says Thomas Kepler, a computational immunologist at Boston Universitys medical school, whos done much of the Egyptian fruit bat research. Some of the genes can ramp up or down their activity even as other ones keep normal functions going. Rather than all of the interferons sounding the standard prepare for war alarm, some may tell cells to hold their fire and sit tight.
The message, Kepler says, may be, Weve got a virus, lets use soft power for as long as we can."

As COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US approach the highest levels seen in the pandemic so far, national efforts to track patients and hospital resources remain in shambles after the federal government abruptly seized control of data collection earlier this month.
The Trump administration issued a directive to hospitals and states July 10, instructing them to stop submitting their daily COVID-19 hospital data to the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwhich has historically handled such public health dataand instead submit it to a new database in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services. The change was ostensibly made to streamline federal data collection, which is critical for assessing the state of the pandemic and distributing needed resources, such as personal protective equipment and remdesivir, an antiviral drug shown to shorten COVID-19 recovery times.
Watchdogs and public health experts were immediately aghast by the switch to the HHS database, fearing the data would be manipulated for political reasons or hidden from public view all together. However, the real threat so far has been the administrative chaos. The switch took effect July 15, giving hospitals and states just days to adjust to the new data collection and submission process.
As such, hospitals have been struggling with the new data reporting, which involves reporting more types of data than the CDCs previous system. Generally, the data includes stats on admissions, discharges, beds and ventilators in use and in reserve, as well as information on patients.
For some hospitals, that data has to be harvested from various sources, such as electronic medical records, lab reports, pharmacy data, and administrative sources. Some larger hospital systems have been working to write new scripts to automate new data mining, while others are relying on staff to compile the data manually into excel spreadsheets, which can take multiple hours each day, according to a report by Healthcare IT News. The task has been particularly onerous for small, rural hospitals and hospitals that are already strained by a crush of COVID-19 patients.
Technical snags
Once the data is collected, hospitals have several options for offering it up to the federal government. They can submit the data directly to the HHS system (called TeleTracking) via an online portal, authorize an IT vendor to submit it to the HHS for them, publish it on their website in a standardized format, or have state officials submit it on their behalf.
Many of these options have proven difficult as well. Some hospitals that have historically reported data directly to their state governments found that their states arent yet authorized to submit hospital data to the new HHS database on their behalf. This has left some hospitals, such as those in New Mexico, with the burden of submitting data to both the state and the HHS. For the hospitals who try to submit on their own, some have scrambled to get all the necessary data collected only to face technical problems inputting data into the portal.
Such was the case for some hospitals in Georgia. ""All of this is taking the very valuable and precious resources away from the fight against COVID-19, Anna Adams, vice president of government relations at the Georgia Hospital Association, told Healthcare IT News.
Amid all the administrative and technical hurdles, the national data on hospitalizations has become a hot mess. The COVID Tracking Projectwhich collects data on a variety of COVID-19 pandemic metricswrote in a blog post July 28 that US hospitalization data is no longer reliable.
The blog noted that between July 20 and July 26, federal totals of currently hospitalized patients has been, on average, 24-percent higher than the totals reported by states. On a state-by-state level, some states are reporting fewer cases than the HHS, some are reporting more, and some federal data has significant day-to-day fluctuations not seen before the reporting transition.
Dark data
This may be due to a variety of factors, including double-reporting by hospitals, or hospitals only reporting to the HHS and not their states now. Some numbers of COVID-19 patients may be different because of dueling definitions states and the HHS use to define COVID-19 patients. For instance, some states may not report suspected or probable cases, or those that tested positive for COVID-19 after being admitted to a hospital for something else.
In a July 30 update, the tracking project noted the continued problems, concluding: Taken together, the gaps and uncertainties in the previously stable hospitalization data mean that this crucial indicator has become much less useful for understanding the true severity of COVID-19 outbreaks.
Likewise, Dave Dillon, vice president of media and public relations at the Missouri Hospital Association, expressed frustration at the timing of this data collection switch.
It's worth mentioning that as we moved toward this change we were approaching the number that would have met or exceeded the maximum hospitalization we'd seen during the virus, Dillon told Healthcare IT News. ""We went dark at the same time we were getting close to what our previous peak was. Moving from a known platform that all of the individuals could easily manipulate has harmed our ability to have that situational awareness.
According to The COVID Tracking Project, hospitalizations reached a peak of 59,885 on July 23, just shy of the high of 59,940 hospitalizations on April 15. The project reports that the number of hospitalizations has since declined but that the numbers they are reporting are likely undercounts.
Meanwhile, an investigation by NPR noted that there were irregularities in the process used by the Trump administration to grant TeleTracking Technologies the $10.2 million contract to set up the federal database. In particular, the CEO of the Pittsburgh-based company has links to the Trump Organization. Congressional investigators are now looking into the matter."

There’s no guarantee the two sides reach a deal, provided the report is accurate. However, it would make sense given the state of US shopping malls.

Some malls have replaced stores with call centers and other non-retail businesses just to stay afloat. COVID-19 further limited those options. It’s hard to rent space to offices that are working from home, and retail is frequently limited to curbside pickup or just a tiny amount of in-store shopping.
Amazon’s presence would likely make smaller mall store owners bristle, but they might not have much choice. The internet giant could provide a regular source of rent and keep malls alive. There would certainly be plenty of irony — the very force destroying malls might represent the best chance at keeping them intact."

One of the more frustrating aspects of the coronavirus pandemic has been the amount of disinformation swirling about. Much of this is politically motivated, perhaps unsurprising with the attention given to President Donald Trump's rambling, error-strewn press conferences. It may seem like commonsense that actively misleading the public during a national emergency has consequences, but now Fox News' two most-watched hosts have unwittingly performed a rather elegant experiment on their viewers that allows us to quantify that effect. The results are stark: greater exposure to Sean Hannity versus Tucker Carlson shows a measurable increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths throughout March and early April.
Hannity and Carlson are Fox News' two biggest stars, each commanding around 4 million viewers for their respective evening shows (Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight). While often it can be hard to see daylight between their ideological pronouncements on-air, in early 2020, the two had markedly different lines on the coronavirus outbreak. Carlson began regularly covering the virus in January. During February, he did so with a growing sense of alarm that the United States could experience a heavy death tollthe same month that saw much inaction on the part of the federal government.By contrast, Hannity gave the virus almost no attention in February. And when he began to discuss the virus at the same frequency as Carlson during the first two weeks of March, it was to minimize the threat compared to the number of annual deaths attributable to car crashes, shootings, or seasonal influenza. Additionally, Hannity also accused the Democratic Party of exaggerating the threat as a way of attacking the president. However, by mid-March, Hannity changed his tune once President Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency.
The study comes from a group of researchers led by the University of Chicago's Leonardo Bursztyn and uses survey data gathered in April from 1,045 regular viewers of Fox News (aged 55 and over) to examine the timing of behavioral changes in response to the viruswhen people began to cancel travel, isolate, increase the frequency of hand-washing, and so on.
The results are striking. Survey participants who preferred watching Carlson began changing their behavior on average three days earlier than other Fox News viewers. Meanwhile, participants who preferred Hannity acted much laterfive days after other Fox News viewers, and eight days after Carlson viewers.
Next, the authors examined the data at a more granular level to determine whether there were local differences in the rate of COVID-19 infections or deaths in areas that watched more Hannity versus Carlson. They found that:
[C]ontrolling for a rich set of county-level demographics (including the local market share of Fox News), greater local viewership of Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is associated with a greater number of COVID-19 cases starting in early March and a greater number of deaths resulting from COVID-19 starting in mid-March. In a set of permutation tests across socio-economic, demographic, political, and health-related covariates, as well as across geographical fixed effects to account for unobservable factors, we show that the established relationship is highly robust. Indeed, the estimated effects of exposure become stronger as we control for more factors.
The study then goes on to tease out whether there could be another reason for this correlation. For instance, could local sunset times affect the data? (Or, as the paper explains, ""if people like to turn on their TVs to watch something when Hannity happens to be on instead of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the likelihood that viewers are shifted to watch Hannity is disproportionately large in areas where Fox News is popular in general."") But the effect remains. As viewership of Hannity increases compared to Carlson, there's a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in mid-March, which begins to decline later in the month as the two hosts' messages on coronavirus converge.
By this point, it's a safe assumption that some of you are screaming at your screens that the authors are idiots, because correlation isn't causation. But the study is well-controlled for other variablesfor example, how rural an area is, how far it is from Seattle, or differential rates of health insurancethat could affect the local spread of COVID-19. For example, geography or rates of health insurance or educational attainment at the county level could explain these results. On top of that, the study builds on previous (recent) work that has shown that there are partisan differences in how people respond to emergenciesareas that saw more votes for Trump have lower hurricane-evacuation rates, for example, as well as GPS data that shows less social distancing in areas that watch greater amounts of Fox News.
Whether Fox News planned to conduct this experiment or not, it does elegantly show that dis- or misinformation during a public health emergency costs lives."

As the entire world continues to grapple with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, it's only natural to have a ton of questions. Ars has done its best to keep readers on top of the most important news while also providing key perspective on those big-picture questions. Where does the spread stand this week? I should be wearing a mask, right? How does science get a vaccine together (and are researchers close)?
So far, however, we haven't totally attempted to grapple with one of the pandemic's biggest outstanding and timely inquiries: what should reopening look like? Beyond essential businesses and healthcare facilities, this month we've slowly started witnessing things like drive-ins returning or racing leagues announce restarts. With entire states from Texas to Florida recently easing various guidelines and restrictions on businesses and public movement, thinking about reopening (whether now is the right time, the kind of safety mechanisms necessary, etc.) feels more pertinent than ever.
This Thursday at 1:30pm ET (10:30am PT), we'll be pondering precisely that when talking to an expert on the subject: Harvard Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science Dr. Joseph Allen. This spring, Dr. Allen has been sought out by everyone from The New York Times to ESPN for his particular expertise in building science, or how indoor build environments from homes and schools to labs and stadiums impact our overall health. (The extreme TL;DR for these times: proper ventilation, filtration, and humidity can help reduce the spread of pathogens.) Dr. Allen has an upcoming book on the subject, Healthy Buildings available on April 21, and obviously COVID-19 has made his focus on the intersection of building science and health science all the more vital.
In (a socially distant, video-chatted) conversation with Ars' intrepid health reporter Dr. Beth Mole, Dr. Allen will field questions from Ars and readers to help us understand and imagine what reopening might (and should) look like for communities and workplaces. The discussion will happen through the livestreaming app Periscope and will be hosted on the Ars Technica Twitter account (@arstechnicayou can certainly @ us with questions), but we'll also embed the video below once things get underway for those who prefer to sit tight onsite. In the meantime, check out some of Dr. Allen's insights linked above and start sharing the most urgent questions on your mind below."

In mid-March, just before President Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency, Stanford psychology professor Robb Willer posted a call to arms on Twitter, asking for suggestions on how the social and behavioral sciences could help to address the pandemic. What ideas might we have to recommend? What research could we do? he asked. All ideas, half-baked or otherwise, are welcome!
Given the importance of our social interactions to the spread of the pandemic, behavioral sciences should have a lot to tell us. So Willer got a large response, and the result was a huge team effort coordinated by Willer and New York University social psychology professor Jay van Bavel. The goal: to sum up all the best and most relevant research from psychology, sociology, public health, and other social sciences. Published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour last weeka lightning-fast turnaround for academiathe resulting paper highlights research that addresses behavioral questions that have come up in the pandemic, from understanding cultural differences to minimizing scientific misinformation.
Different sections, each written by researchers with expertise in that particular field, summarize research on topics from social inequality to science communication and fake news. Responding to the crisis requires people to change their behavior, the papers authors argue, so we need to draw on behavioral research to help align human behavior with the recommendations of epidemiologists and public health experts.
But while Willer, van Bavel, and their colleagues were putting together their paper, another team of researchers put together their own, entirely opposite, call to arms: a plea, in the face of an avalanche of behavioral science research on COVID-19, for psychology researchers to have some humility. This papercurrently published online in draft format and seedingaviddebateson social mediaargues that much of psychological research is nowhere near the point of being ready to help in a crisis. Instead, it sketches out an evidence readiness framework to help people determine when the field will be.
So are the social sciences ready to help us navigate the pandemic? Evidently, experts disagree, and their scuffle is part of a broader debate about how much evidence we need before we act. The coronavirus crisis forces a tough, society-wide lesson on scientific uncertainty. And with such escalated stakes, how do we balance the potential harm of acting prematurely with the harm of not acting at all?
Enlarge/ Humanity, being all complicated again at the Pennsylvania capital.
If humans didnt insist on being quite so messily human, pandemic response would be much simpler. People would stay physically separated whenever possible; leaders would be proactive and responsive to evidence; our fight could be concentrated on the biomedical tools we so urgently need. The problem is that our maddening, imperfect humanity gets in the way at every turn, and getting around those imperfections demands that we understand the human behavior underlying them.
It's also clear that we need to understand the differences between groups of people to get a handle on the pandemic. Speculation has been rampant about how cultural differences might influence what sort of responses are palatable. And some groups are suffering disproportionately: death rates are higher among African-American and Latinx communities in the US, while a large analysis from the UK found that black, minority ethnic, and poorer people are at higher risk of deathour social inequalities, housing, transport, and food systems all play a role in shaping the crisis. We cant extricate people and our complicated human behavior and society from the pandemic: they are one and the same.
In their paper, Van Bavel, Willer and their group of behavioral research proponents point to studies from fields like public health, sociology and psychology. They cover work on cultural differences, social inequality, mental health, and more, pulling out suggestions for how the research could be useful for policymakers and community leaders.
Those recommendations are pretty intuitive. For effective communications, it could be helpful to lean on sources that carry weight in different communities, like religious leaders, they suggest. And public health messaging that emphasizes protecting othersrather than fixating on just protecting oneselftends to be persuasive, the proponents argue.
But not everyone is convinced that it would necessarily be a good idea to act on the recommendations. Many of the topics surveyed are relevant, write psychologist Hans IJzerman and a team of critics in their draft. The team's concern isnt the relevance of the research; its how robust that research is. If there are critical flaws in the supporting data, then applying these lessons on a broad scale could be worse than uselessit could be actively harmful.
I was pretty disappointed, says Simine Vazire, a UC Davis psychology professor and one of the team of critics. In the introduction to their paper, van Bavel and the other proponents write that each section describes the quality of the evidence that it rests on. But there was nowhere near the level of evidence evaluation Vazire expected, she says. She points to a section on healthy mindsets, which suggests that with the right mindset, difficult experiences can lead to stress-related growthand that mindsets can be changed with just short interventions.
That literature is really flawed, she says. There are probably individuals who grow from stress, but its not the norm. Its an irresponsible thing to claim, she argues: It could make people feel bad if they think most people grow from trauma and stress, and if they dontwhich is much, much more typicalthat could add to their depression and anxiety.
Sander van der Linden, a psychologist at Cambridge University and one of van Bavels co-authors, argues that the paper was cautious in its claims, taking care to phrase things using words that convey uncertainty, avoid direct prescriptions for policy, and point out where more research is needed. The paper is intended to function more as an opinion piece, he says, and less as a claim of whats true and whats false."

Whistleblower Rick Bright plans to tell Congress that ""2020 will be the darkest winter in modern history"" if the United States ignores warnings from scientists that it's too early to fully reopen the economy.
Bright, who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) until he says Trump administration officials forced him out of his position, is scheduled to testify tomorrow at a House hearing on the topic of ""protecting scientific integrity in the COVID-19 response."" Bright's written testimony was posted online today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health, which is holding the hearing.
Bright wrote:
While I am unfortunately no longer leading BARDA, I am an expert in these areas and fully understand the grave risks we are facing. I continue to believe that we must act urgently to effectively combat this deadly disease. Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities. While it is terrifying to acknowledge the extent of the challenge that we currently confront, the undeniable fact is there will be a resurgence of the COVID-19 this fall, greatly compounding the challenges of seasonal influenza and putting an unprecedented strain on our health care system. Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be the darkest winter in modern history.
While President Trump is pushing to reopen America and has clashed with state governors over shutdown orders, Bright said the government needs to give the American people ""one message in a voice that is clear, consistent, trustworthy, and backed by the best science available.""
""As my colleague Dr. Anthony Fauci testified on May 12, 2020, we must not rush blindly, or act too quickly, in returning to our daily lives,"" Bright wrote. ""If we ignore the science, we stand a dramatically increased risk of worsening the spread of the virus in the coming months. This could lead to more widespread outbreaks and to many more lives lost throughout the remainder of this year.""
New normal wont be easy to achieve
Bright wrote that ""the normal of 2019 is not going to return, but we all have an opportunity to shape the new normal of 2020 and beyond."" It will take ""the participation and cooperation of every American"" to achieve that, he said.
""Today, we need clear and simple messages to teach us how wear a face cover, when and how to safely go outside or back to work or back to school. It's that simple,"" he wrote.
Bright said he believes a COVID-19 cure will be found. But in the meantime, he wrote that the US must increase public education about hand-washing, social distancing, face coverings, and self-monitoring; ramp up production of ""critical supplies and protective gear"" for medical workers and first responders; distribute equipment and supplies equitably in order to ""eliminate the state-vs.-state competition""; and develop ""a national testing strategy.""
""We need tests that are accurate, rapid, easy to use, low cost, and available to everyone who needs them. We need be able to trust the results so that we can trace contacts, isolate, and quarantine appropriately while striving to develop a cure,"" he said.
Whistleblower investigation continues
As we wrote last week, Bright's whistleblower complaint to the US Office of Special Counsel details how the Trump administration's COVID-19 response was hampered by cronyism and denial about the virus's severity. Bright says his early warnings about the pandemic and shortages of critical medical supplies were largely ignored and that he was transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in a ""retaliatory demotion.""
Trump dismissed Bright as ""a disgruntled employee who's trying to help the Democrats win an election,"" according to NPR. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the agency ""strongly disagrees with the allegations and characterizations in the complaint from Dr. Bright.""
But the Office of Special Counsel's preliminary investigation found ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that the Trump administration retaliated against Bright in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, according to Bright's lawyers. (The Office of Special Counsel doesn't comment on open investigations.) An in-depth investigation by the Office is ongoing, and the Trump administration's handling of Bright is likely to be discussed at tomorrow's hearing.
Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), who chairs the subcommittee and scheduled tomorrow's hearing, said last week that Bright's ""complaint deserves examination.""
""Dr. Bright's whistleblower complaint raises serious concerns about the administration's COVID-19 response including alleged gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, and scientific censorship,"" Eshoo said."

President Donald Trump believes that America is the world's champion when it comes to coronavirus testing.
""In the span of just a few short months, weve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and its not even close,"" Trump said in a Monday press conference. He noted that daily testing has risen from around 150,000 per day three weeks ago to around 300,000 per day this week and that the US was on track to surpass 10 million tests this week (we reached that milestone on Thursday).
Trump is correct in one respect: the US has performed more coronavirus tests than any other country with the possible exception of China. But by most other measures, the American testing effort is mediocre at best.
Let's start with per capita testing capacity. In his Monday briefing, Trump said that ""we're testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries."" It's truebarelythat the US is doing better than these countries.
Early in the coronavirus crisis, the US was a testing laggard. Regulatory problems slowed the development of tests in February, and as a result, we had a lot of ground to make up in late March and April. But in the last month, the US has surpassed a number of other countries in per-capita terms.
However, the US is far from being the world's leader in per capita testing. Denmark, Russia, Australia, and several other countries are conducting more tests per person than the US.
The larger problem, however, is that tests per capita isn't the best way to evaluate a country's testing performance. What ultimately matters isn't tests per person, it's tests per person positive for COVID-19 because you need a high ratio in order to get a clear picture of the pandemic's progression. And on this score, the US is still way behind:
The US leads the world in the absolute number of coronavirus tests, with more than 10 million completed. But we also lead the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, at more than 1.4 million. If you divide 10 million by 1.4 million, you get around seven tests per coronavirus case. Other countries have had far more testing capacity over the course of their epidemics.
A lack of testing capacity particularly hampered our COVID-fighting efforts in March and early April. At that time, testing was focused on severe COVID-19 cases and health care workers because we didn't have enough tests for others. People with milder COVID-like symptoms were often sent home without being tested, and there was little to no spare capacity for testing friends, family, and coworkers who had come into contact with COVID-19 patients.
Fortunately, America's testing ratio has been improving over time. On Thursday, for example, there were 366,944 test results, producing 25,203 new confirmed cases. That's a ratio of more than 14 tests per confirmed case. Or to put it another way, about 6.9 percent of coronavirus tests conducted yesterday were positive.
That's a good sign because ample testing is helpful for getting the spread of the coronavirus under controlespecially as some states begin to relax quarantine restrictions. But it's not time to declare victory yet. The countries with the best track records fighting the coronaviruscountries like Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealandhave conducted dozens of tests for every infection. Moreover, with many states relaxing their lockdown rules, there's a risk that infections will start to climb again. If that happens, we'll want to be ready with plenty of spare testing capacity."

Officials in Texas and Arizona have requested refrigerated trucks to hold the dead as hospitals and morgues become overwhelmed by victims of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.
In the hospital, there are only so many places to put bodies, Ken Davis, chief medical officer of Christus Santa Rosa Health System in the San Antonio area, said in a briefing this week. We're out of space, and our funeral homes are out of space, and we need those beds. So, when someone dies, we need to quickly turn that bed over.
Its a hard thing to talk about, Davis added. People's loved ones are dying.""
Overall, Texas is seeing a surge in hospitalizations and deaths among people infected with the new coronavirusand reports of new infections are still on the rise. On Wednesday alone, the state reported 10,791 new cases, bringing the total to over 282,000 cases. The state has reported over 3,400 deaths so far.
Several other areas in the state have ordered, bought, or are seeking refrigerated trucks or trailers to hold bodies. That includes Nueces, Cameron, Travis, Hidalgo, and Harris counties, as well as the city of Austin, according to The Texas Tribune.
The picture is not looking much better in Arizona, were hospitalizations and deaths are also spiking. The state, which has counted over 134,000 cases and 2,492 deaths, has reached 90 percent capacity of its beds for adult intensive care patients. The mayor of Phoenix said late last week that the city is working to secure refrigerator trucks.
A similar scenario may play out in Florida, which is also reporting record numbers of cases and deaths. In recent days, the state has record highs, with over 15,300 cases on July 12 and 156 deaths today. Around 50 hospitals in the state have run out of adult beds in their intensive care units, according to the Agency for Healthcare Administration.
The grim reality echoes the height of the outbreak in the New York City area earlier this year, which was marked by dozens of refrigerator trucks, some parked outside hospitals. In April, one Manhattan-based ER doctor feared that if our national response to the pandemic did not improve, the trucks would become an enduring image. Every disaster has its images, its symbols. For COVID-19, it might just be the refrigerator truck. Its our overflow morgue, holding the patients we could not save.
So far, the United States has reported more than 3.5 million cases and 138,000 deaths in the COVID-19 pandemicmore cases and deaths than any other country. Nationwide tallies of daily cases and hospitalizations are currently increasing."

A segment of science Twitter was rocked over the weekend by the discovery that a long-standing, pseudonymous online member had died of COVID-19-related complications. But grief quickly turned to shock, hurt, and anger when the deceased turned out to have never existed. Rather, it was a sock puppet account that we now know was created and maintained by BethAnn McLaughlin, a neuroscientist and founder of the #MeTooSTEM advocacy group whose Twitter handle is @McLNeuro.
""I take full responsibility for my involvement in creating the @Sciencing_Bi Twitter account,"" McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The New York Times through her lawyer. ""My actions are inexcusable. I apologize without reservation to all the people I hurt. As I've reflected on my actions the last few days, it's become clear to me that I need mental health treatment, which I'm pursuing now. My failures are mine alone, so I'm stepping away from all activities with #MeTooSTEM to ensure that it isn't unfairly criticized for my actions.""
This certainly isn't the first time a fake persona has manifested on social media. Way back in 2003, controversial American Enterprise Institute scholar John R. Lott Jr.. was outed by The Washington Post for creating a sock-puppet online persona, ""Mary Rosh,"" purportedly a former student, and using it to mount spirited defenses of his work online. In 2017, there was the case of ""Jenna Abrams,"" who boasted 70,000 Twitter followers; the fake persona was so convincing that she managed to spread a viral rumor that CNN's local Boston station had accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography late one night in November 2016.
In 2019, we had the strange case of Eugene Gu, a former surgery resident at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who went viral on Twitter a few years ago after taking a knee in his hospital scrubs in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. An investigation by The Verge revealed evidence that Gu operated several sock puppet Twitter accounts, most notably one under the name @MaryLauryMD (since deleted). And just last month, The Daily Beast exposed a network of fake op-ed writers who had been placing editorials on Middle East policy with conservative outlets, such as Newsmax and the Washington Examiner.
But the particular case of @Sciencing_Bi is unique because of its unusually long durationthe Twitter account was created in October 2016and the absence of any obvious financial motive that is a common feature of catfishing scams.
""I've been acquainted with that account for years, and nothing seemed unusual about it,"" Greg Gbur told Ars. He's a physicist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and he interacted occasionally with @Sciencing_Bi on Twitter. He never noticed anything amiss. ""She seemed like a nice person, passionate about STEM representation. No indication of a scam for money or anything like that. It's all a bit mystifying.""

@Sciencing_Bi, identified on her profile only as ""Alepo,"" claimed to be a female bisexual Native American anthropologist at Arizona State University who was involved with combatting discrimination and sexual harassment in the scientific community. She had a modest follower count (about 2,400) and interacted frequently with several well-known scientists, science writers, and science communicators on Twitter. (Full disclosure: while I never interacted with the account myself, I know many of those on science Twitter who did.)
In April, she announced that she had contracted COVID-19 and subsequently documented a months-long struggle with the disease. She specifically blamed her employer, ASU, for her plight, and she claiming that she and other teachers, staff, and students had been forced to to remain on campus well into April. She also asserted that the school had cut her salary by 15 percent while she was hospitalized. Then on Friday, July 31, McLaughlin tweeted that @Sciencing_Bipurportedly a close friendhad died of complications from COVID-19, followed by a series of impassioned tweets eulogizing her late friend.
There was the usual online outpouring of condolences and grief alongside outrage at her plight and purported mistreatment by ASU. McLaughlin even set up a Zoom memorial service for @Sciencing_Bi; those attending included noted University of California, Berkeley, biologist Michael Eisen and Melissa Bates, a physiologist at the University of Iowa.
Huh.
That's when things got weird. Both Eisen and Bates were surprised that only five people, including themselves and McLaughlin, attended the virtual memorialno former students, no colleagues, no friends, and no family members. As Bates noted in a twitter thread, ""This is a community. And if this person was part of the community, where was the community?"" Bates' suspicions were aroused in earnest when McLaughlin told her that Sciencing_Bi had mentioned her in her will. ""You don't leave sh*t to randos on the Internet when you're first gen and you've got an undocumented family,"" Bates tweeted. ""You do everything for your familia.""
Additional details revealed during the service seemed didn't seem to add up. Several photographs that @Sciencing_Bi tweeted turned out to be stock photos. And while @Sciencing_Bi had been well-known online to many in the sci-comm community, it turned out that nobody had actually met her in real lifeexcept for McLaughlin.
Others found it odd that there was no outside confirmation of @Sciencing_Bi's death from ASU or a local obituary. ""We have been looking into this for the last 24 hours and cannot verify any connection with the university,"" ASU spokesperson Katie Paquet told BuzzFeed News on Monday. ""We have been in touch with several deans and faculty members and no one can identify the account or who might be behind it. We also have had no one, such as a family member or friend, report a death to anyone at the university."" ASU also denied that there had been any salary cuts and said that, like most other educational institutions, the university had shut down in March and switched to online classes. By Sunday, Eisen and many others publicly acknowledged that they'd been had: the person they had known as @Sciencing_Bi had never existed.
Attention next turned to identifying the person behind the fake account. For Twitter sleuths, McLaughlin was the most obvious suspect. McLaughlin is a polarizing figure within the community after having risen to prominence as an advocate for victims of sexual harassment in STEM. She shared MIT Media Lab's Disobedience Award in 2018 with biologist Sherry Marts and #MeToo movement founder Tarana Burke. She also founded #MeTooSTEM.

But allegations soon emerged that McLaughlin bullied and harassed others, especially people of color. She also faced accusations of a lack of transparency. The entire #MeTooSTEM board would eventually resign, leaving just McLaughlin herself and a single volunteer listed on the site.
Could McLaughlin actually have concocted the @Sciencing_Bi persona? There were strong hints this might be the case. For instance, a July 2018 tweet in which McLaughlin claimed to be with @Sciencing_Bi at Yosemite National Park was accompanied by a photograph, but the partially obscured person in the picture turned out to be McLaughlin's daughter, not @Sciencing_Bi. (McLaughlin admitted as much to Gizmodo.)
@Sciencing_Bi was tagged in a group photo at a 2019 academic conference, along with several others, but she was not depicted in the photograph. Analytical chemist Amber Barnard tweeted about a 2019 exchange with @Sciencing_Bi when she volunteered to help with a campaign last year to get McLaughlin's tenure restored at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. @Sciencing_Bi promised to send access to a Google doc, but when the invitation came, it was from McLaughlin's account.
All of this is technically circumstantial evidence, of course. But most of those who were duped were soon convinced that McLaughlin was behind the account, even though she initially denied the allegations. Gizmodo's Ed Cara spoke with McLaughlin on the telephone, reporting:
She stuck by her claim that @Sciencing_Bi had died from covid-19, as far as she knew. When I asked how she had learned of the death, she only would say that it was through a family contact. I then asked if she would be willing to reveal the identity of @Sciencing_Bi, and she said no. She also denied being the creator of the account. McLaughlin did admit, however, that she had access to the @Sciencing_Bi account, though she went on to state that it was not her who made the account private.
Her response to BuzzFeed was more succinct: ""I'm not going to dox anyone. Thank you for your interest."" Now, of course, she has doxxed herself with her admission of guilt to The New York Times.
Both McLaughlin's and Sciencing_Bi's accounts were suspended late Sunday night by Twitter for violating the platform's terms of use, and the Twitter account for MeTooSTEM has been slapped with a ""suspicious activity"" label. As Buzzfeed, Gizmodo, and Arizona Republic reporter Rachel Leingang all noted in their reporting, Twitter declined to elaborate further regarding the evidence on which its decision was based (e.g., whether there was any hard evidence linking the two accounts). McLaughlin has since been removed from the editorial board of the Journal of Neuroscience and no longer has access to the associated rogue joke account Twitter, according to editor in chief Marina Picciotto, a Yale neuroscientist.

It might be surprising that so many smart people fell for what, in retrospect, seems to be a fairly obvious hoax. But the online science community has a long history of incorporating pseudonymous personas going back to the earliest days of science blogging, when many scientistsespecially those without tenurewanted to avoid being penalized by their departments for blogging. (I still occasionally think of science writer Bethany Brookshire by her early pseudonym, Scicurious.) So the inclination to give someone the benefit of the doubt for using a pseudonym was already established. All McLaughlin needed, according to Eisen, was plausibility, a connection, and a good hook to gain the community's trust. The @Sciencing_Bi persona had all three elements.
""It's not like we don't know there are trolls and sock puppets, etc.,"" Eisen told Ars. ""But this account was good. It had a backstory. It had a reason for being a pseud that we all accepted easily because we understand how people who aren't straight feel in a tenuous position with regard to employment, and a pseud is a natural for them. We also saw that people we know exist said they knew her. That was enough to pretty quickly elevate this person to reality. She just seemed like one of us.""
The account was so convincing that nobody who interacted with her on Twitter thought to verify her various claims, many of which were easily checked. For example, Eisen admitted that he naively took @Sciencing_Bi's word for odd claims like the 15 percent paycut from ASU. ""I was willing to excuse various idiosyncrasies of the account because I could chalk them up to her not being totally forthcoming in order to protect her identity,"" he said. ""Plenty of people either obscure or fake their institutional affiliations to maintain anonymity.""
But why?
McLaughlin's motives for creating the sock puppet account are also puzzling to many. Here, one can only speculate. But attention on social media is a form of capital in its own right; we've all experienced the occasional rush of dopamine from a positive online interactionor the shot of adrenaline when our sense of outrage is triggered. In McLaughlin's case, it seems she sought to counter criticism for her alleged harassment of people of color by creating an indigenous sock puppeta cool bisexual Hopi scientistto defend her.
""'I have POC friends' is a line used across the racist spectrum, but inventing your POC friend is next level,"" a researcher and organizer who frequently deals with misinformation, but asked not to be identified, told Ars.
McLaughlin also may have derived satisfaction from manufacturing a series of personal crises for @Sciencing_Bi in order to provoke an outpouring of sympathy without having to reveal her true self. The New York Times article quotes psychiatrist Dr. Marc Feldman, who specializes in what he has dubbed ""Munchausen by internet."" This is the virtual version of Munchausen syndrome by proxyand a behavior that he is seeing more of during the ongoing pandemic.

After much political to-ing and fro-ing, it seems everyone is now on the same page: people should wear face masks in public while the coronavirus pandemic rages. A mask might not stop you from getting sick, but it may well prevent you from infecting other people. But what happens if you need to wear a face mask while operating a machine that depends upon seeing your face? I am of course referring to fleet drivers who drive vehicles with vision-based driver monitoring systems (DMSes), and the answer is ""you need to update your DMS to work with face masks."" Which is exactly what Israeli company Eyesight Technologies has done.
A lot of the focus on DMSes has been for passenger vehicles in relation to partly automated driver aids like GM's Super Cruise (which uses gaze-tracking to ensure the driver is looking at the road ahead as a condition for operation) or Tesla's Autopilot (which has been repeatedly criticized by federal safety agencies for failing to do the same).
But a DMS isn't just a good idea for a hands-free driving aid; people can and do get distracted in plain-old regular cars, too. Which is why automakers like Subaru and Mazda equip their vehicles with camera-based DMSes here in the US and abroad.Convincing individual drivers that a safety option is worth ticking when buying a new car is one thing, but like telematics that monitor a vehicle's health and its driver's behavior, it's a different story when we're talking about fleets of commercial vehicles. And it's this application that Eyesight's system is aimed at. It sells an aftermarket system called FleetSense that watches a number of facial features like a driver's mouth, eyes, eyelids, and head pose to detect when that driver isn't paying attention to the road or is falling asleep. But the algorithm doesn't like it when it can't recognize all those facial featureslike when someone is wearing a mask, for instance.
With the prospect of China restarting its economy in the coming months, the company has reworked its software so that a driver wearing a mask won't defeat the DMS, and it's beginning the process of rolling the updated software out to its clients, including one at the center of the pandemic. And maybe here in the US, too:
""Exsun is a telematics service provider in Wuhan, China supporting hundreds of thousands of trucks,"" Eyesight VP of product Tal Krzypow told me by email. ""They are a customer of Eyesight Technologies and will be rolling out Fleet Sense, our aftermarket driver monitoring system for fleets, in the coming months. We expect their drivers to continue wearing masks as the city gets back to work. We are working with similar telematic/ fleet service providers in the US. Unfortunately, we cannot mention them by name as they have not yet announced the news."""

How much of an immune response does a SARS-CoV-2 infection produce? It's a critical question for all sorts of reasons. To begin with, long-lasting immunity, either through an infection or a vaccine, is critical for any hope of returning the world to something that resembles its pre-pandemic state. It's also essential to understanding how safe people who have recovered from infections are and how they can behave in the face of continued outbreaks and spread.
But there are also more subtle public policy issues. Since testing wasn't generally available at the time of many outbreaks, we'll need antibody tests to figure out who was actually exposed. And the accuracy of those testswhich has been called into questioncan have a big influence on studies of the pandemic's progression.
A bunch of recent draft papers have looked at the sort of immune response we're seeing in patients who have cleared the virus after testing positive for it. And the results suggest that it's very variableas is the quality of the tests that detect it. (We'll remind you that pre-publication documents carry some quality risks.)
Testing 1, 2, 3, 4
One of the more comprehensive studies on the subject comes from the New York Blood Center. That organization was serving as the clearinghouse for tests of whether the antibodies of those who have cleared the infection could be used to help patients with COVID-19. So, it had access to a large collection of samples from people who were known to have been infected. A research team based there used those samples to test both the immune response in these individuals and the ability of tests to assay it.
Several of these tests looked at whether antibodies against the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were present at all. One of those test is called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA. This produces a high-quality, quantitative measure of the number of antibodies that recognize a specific protein. But it's not very amenable to automation, and it tends to require researchers to perform the tests by hand.
There are high-throughput diagnostic tests that work on similar principles to the ELISA, and they are typically used by centralized testing facilities. The researchers had access to these tests from two different commercial sources at the Blood Center. Finally, they also obtained a variety of small antibody testing kits of the sort that might be sold to the general public.
For the sophisticated tests, the results were generally good. Out of a population of 370 individuals that had had their infection confirmed while active, the ELISA test done in the labs showed that over 96 percent had detectable antibodies to one of the viral proteins. Testing against two other viral proteins showed 85 and 89 percent of the population had antibodies. Only about 2 percent had no detectable antibodies using this assay.
Things were good when the high-throughput diagnostic machines were used to run tests. These picked up antibodies in 91 and 96 percent of the population, depending on the manufacturer. The small commercial tests, however, didn't do especially well, with less than 80 percent of them correctly identifying the presence of antibodies.
The researchers did perform a small number of tests on negative controlssamples taken from donors prior to when SARS-CoV-2 reached the United States. While these were enough to show that the tests were working properly, they didn't look at enough negative control samples to determine whether any of the tests had a high frequency of false positives.
Variations
As we mentioned above, the more sophisticated assays used here don't just detect the presence or absence of antibodiesthey provide an estimate of how much is present. And here, the researchers found that the quantities varied widely. The difference between the highest and lowest values produced by the test varied by a factor of over 1,000.
It's difficult to know whether that means that the higher immune responses are more effective, however. Some antibodies are what is termed ""neutralizing,"" in that they bind to the virus in a way that keeps it from infecting cells. So, the researchers engineered the coronavirus' spike protein into an unrelated virus and used that to infect cultured cells in the presence of antibodies from all these donors. This provided a measure of how often neutralizing antibodies were present.
The vast majority (between 80 and 90 percent) of the donors had some level of neutralizing antibody. But the levels of neutralization went up roughly in line with the amount of antibody presentwhich, as we've just discussed, varies considerably. The end result is that the levels of neutralizing antibody varied over a range of 40,000-fold differences. Unfortunately, this means that, in all likelihood, the variability of the antibodies we see roughly correlates with the amount of protection they're likely to offer. (Neutralizing antibodies haven't yet been demonstrated to be effective in patients.)
Waiting for the herd
While this is a draft paper and should be viewed cautiously, the results are largely in line with a separate draft study of 175 patients done by an unrelated group of researchers in China. This also saw high levels of variability and a small subset of patients that had no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Another group based in New York found even higher levels of variability, but it found neutralizing antibodies in most patients, even if they were rare.
There have also been a number of draft studies that suggest that the levels of antibody produced correlate roughly with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms that a person experienced.
For now, what do we conclude from all of this? The first is that, to get a more accurate picture of who has actually experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection, we're going to want to rely on high-throughput assays. Right now, the smaller personal kits may be helpful for people who are interested in getting a rough picture of their own medical history, but the results aren't up to the quality we'd want for understanding the public's exposure.
The second thing is that SARS-CoV-2 infection isn't necessarily producing a robust immunity. We don't really know what levels of neutralizing antibodies are actually protective, but it's clear that a lot of people don't produce many of them after an infection. Which means any plans for generating herd immunity by allowing a controlled level of infection have to be viewed with extreme skepticism at this point. And vaccine developers will need to ensure that the infections produce a consistently high-level response that includes neutralizing antibodies."

States and cities all but completely shut down earlier this year in an attempt to stem the spread of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Many of those state and local authorities have now eased up on restrictions, allowing people to return to their pre-pandemic habits and behaviors. In many of those regions, COVID-19 cases are now on the rise, but the White House is pushing the message that COVID-19 spikes are due to an increase in testing and nothing more.
President Donald Trump said during a meeting on Monday, ""If we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."" Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on that messaging in a call with several states governors later in the day, trying to downplay any new outbreaks in their states.
""I would just encourage you all, as we talk about these things, to make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,"" Pence told the governors, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times.
The Vice President has headed up the administration's official coronavirus response task force since late February. That task force has consistently sidelined critics and downplayed expertise in an apparent effort to move past the pandemic's economic effects as quickly as possible. 
Pence echoed Trump in referring to pockets where COVID-19 exists as ""embers,"" a framing that was echoed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Certain locations, such as nursing homes and particularly meat-processing plants, have seen large outbreaks. ""If any of them light on fire,"" Azar said, speaking metaphorically, ""We've got to get there right away.""
Pence added:
Encourage people with the news that we are safely reopening the country. That, as we speak today, because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up. But according to our most current information, hospitalizations for coronavirus are going down across the country.
Unfortunately, Pence was wrong. According to pretty much all major trackers (Johns Hopkins University, New York Times, NPR) COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations are on the rise in well over a dozen states.
Back to the bad days
More than 2.1 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 this year, and more than 110,000 have died. The consequences, however, have not been evenly spread. Early on, urban hot spots such as Seattle and New York City seemed to account for a high percentage of the ill. Six months into the year, the disease is much more widespread.
Increased testing does result in increased diagnosis but only up to a point. Testing zero people will certainly result in zero positive results, that much is true. During the first weeks and months of the pandemic, the US did indeed have woefully insufficient testing capacity, and so every newly available batch of tests seemed to make the data spike. 
But the testing situation has roughly stabilized, with an average of 461,000 tests performed per day in June, and we now have clearer data available about positivity ratesthe number of performed tests that come back positive for SARS-CoV-2.
If testing is up and the prevalence of the disease is stable or decreasing, you should see a lower positivity rate in the data on average. For example, if you hypothetically tested an average of 1,000 people per day for a week, and an average of 50 tests per day came back positive, you'd have a 5 percent positivity rate. If you increased that hypothetical testing capacity to an average of 1,500 people per day, and the case levels were stable or dropping, you might still see about 50 positives per dayabout a 3 percent positivity rate. But if you keep testing capacity at 1,500 people per day and start to see 100 cases per day, your positive rate is now up to more than 6 percent, and your local case counts are growing.
States
For example, Virginia's current positivity, as of June 16, stands at 7.4 percent according to state data. That's a significant improvement for the commonwealth, overall: in April, the rate peaked at a high of more than 20 percent and has been generally working its way downward since then as testing increased.
Arizona, on the other hand, is on the opposite trajectory. Although it reports an overall positivity rate of 8.7 percent, state data shows that number has been going up every week since May 17. Last week, the state hit a record high of 14 percent positivity, and so faras of June 16the rate for this week stands at 21 percent. (That may decrease as more test results come in during the rest of the week.)
Similar situations are unfolding elsewhere. For example, Texas reported record-high COVID-19 hospitalizations on Monday, according to The Texas Tribune. North Carolina also recorded a hospitalization high on Monday, according to the state. And Oregon, after a long decrease in hospitalizations, began to see those numbers creep back up again in June, coinciding with a stark increase in new cases, The Oregonian reports.
Public health experts in Arizona have linked that increase to the state's early reopening efforts. The increase was not unforeseeableeven by the administration. Trump in May said in an interview that he expected ""there'll be more death"" as the country came back online, telling ABC News, ""Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."""

Test, isolate, trace, quarantine: these are the bedrock public health measures proven effective at stamping out an infectious disease before it flares to the point where the only option left is to foist draconian lockdowns on whole populations.
The World Health Organization and public health experts have uttered and re-uttered the strategy ad nauseam since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in January. And health officials in many places followed the advice, quickly testing those at risk, isolating those infected, tracing people with whom patients had contact, and quarantining anyone exposed. Its a strategy that requires leadership and resources but also public cooperation and commitment from everyone to do their part to defeat a common viral enemy for the greater good. With all of that, the strategy works. The places that followed the advice and largely stood togetherHong Kong and South Korea, for instanceare among those that have been the most successful at containing the devastating new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
The United States, meanwhile, did not take the advice, and the virus has spread widely, triggering lockdowns and now re-lockdowns. So far, the US has recorded over 2.7 million cases and more than 128,000 deathsand counting. The country has more than 25 percent of the cases globally, while only having around 4 percent of the worlds population. Still, the lesson has not sunk in.
In New York, public health officials are struggling to convince some residents to work with contact tracers as a new cluster threatens to turn into a flare-up. The Empire State was once the epicenter of the countrys still-roaring pandemic but has since seen its outbreak subside. New York is now at a point where vigilant testing, isolating, tracing, and quarantining contact can extinguish lingering embersbut only if people comply.
Not answering the call
On Wednesday, officials in Rockland Countyjust north of New York Cityreported a cluster of cases linked to a recent party of up to 100 people largely in their early 20s. At the time of the party, the host was infected and had symptoms but held the party anyway.
So far, at least eight attendees have tested positive for the virus. But many partygoers have refused to work with public health officials to track the potential spread and notify others who may have been infected and could go on to spread the disease further.
We are not receiving the necessary cooperation when we contact those who are positive for COVID-19 or those who have been at some of these gatherings, Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, Rockland Countys health commissioner said at a press briefing Wednesday.
She explained:
My staff has been told that a person does not wish to, or have to, speak to my disease investigators. They hang up. They deny being at the party even though we have found their name from another party attendee or a parent provides us with the information. Many do not answer their cell phones and do not call back. Sometimes parents answer for their adult children and promise that they have been home consistently when they have not been.
This must stop.
In response, Ruppert announced that the county will issue subpoenas to anyone who refuses to cooperate with contact tracing. So far, the county is processing eight subpoenas. In addition, those who do not comply will face civil fines of around $2,000 every day they are out of compliance.
Ruppert went on to note that the young people exposed could go on to spread the virus to vulnerable people in the community, including older relatives, people with underlying health conditions, and young children who may be at risk of developing a severe inflammatory disorder. And even though young adults have relatively less risk of severe outcomes than other groups, they too could become seriously ill.
You may wish to be invincible, Ruppert said. But youre not. None of us are against this dreadful disease.
Deadly serious
Rockland County Executive Ed Day added at the press conference that people who attended the party are not in trouble for attending. Rather, officials just want information to track the virus, and theyll do what they need to get it.
We are deadly serious, Day said. I will not allow to have the health of our county compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance or anything else for that matter.
Contact tracing in general has been a struggle in the US. Several cities and states have reported difficulty in contacting people and convincing them to help trace the virus. But Ruppert and Day both noted that when Rockland County faced a similar problem during an explosive measles outbreak in 2019, issuing subpoenas worked. I expect the same now, Ruppert said.
Ruppert and Day also noted that county officials had learned that more parties are planned for the Fourth of July, including by people who were at the party where COVID-19 was spread. To prevent this, the county will strictly enforce social-distancing measures still in place and the required isolation and quarantine orders for people infected or exposed, Day said.
For the people who were at the earlier party: Were asking them nicely now,"" Day said, ""theyll be getting subpoenas later."""

Researchers have now reported data from early (and small) clinical trials of four candidate COVID-19 vaccines.
So far, the data is positive. The vaccines appear to be generally safe, and they spur immune responses against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. But whether these immune responses are enough to protect people from infection and disease remains an important unknown.
The four candidates are now headed to larger trialsphase III trialsthat will put them to the ultimate test: can they protect people from COVID-19 and end this pandemic?
The challenge
While early trials looking at safety and immune response required dozens or hundreds of volunteers, researchers will now have to recruit tens of thousands. Ideally, volunteers will be in places that still have high levels of SARS-CoV-2 circulating. The more likely it is that volunteers will encounter the virus in their communities, the easier it is to extrapolate if a vaccine is protective. As such, researchers are planning to do a significant amount of testing in the US and other parts of the Americas, which have largely failed at controlling the pandemic.
There has been much debate about the use of human challenge trials, in which researchers would give young, healthy volunteers at low risk from COVID-19 an experimental vaccine and then intentionally expose them to SARS-CoV-2 in controlled settings. This could potentially provide a clearer, faster answer on vaccine efficacy. Its certainly an appealing idea given the catastrophic pandemicand it's an idea that has gained traction in recent weeks. An advocacy group called 1Day Sooner has collected the names of more than 30,000 people willing to participate in such a trial, for instance.
But experts remain divided on the idea. The main concern is that there is no rescue treatment for COVID-19 that can fully protect a trial volunteer from severe disease and death if an experimental vaccine fails. Though young, healthy people have less risk than older people and those with underlying health conditions, some still suffer severe disease and death from COVID-19and its unclear why. Opponents also note that challenge trials may not be faster or necessary, given the high levels of disease spread in the US and elsewhere.
Though the debate on challenge trials is ongoing, its unclear if researchers will end up needing or using them. Meanwhile, traditional phase III trials are now underwayand they have generated plenty of enthusiasm from the public. According to a report this week, more than 138,600 people have signed up through the National Institutes of Health to participate in vaccine testing. If all goes well, we could have data from these trials by the end of the year.
So how do the four top vaccine candidates work, and what do we know about them?
mRNA-1273: Moderna, NIAID
mRNA-1273 is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine made by the biotechnology company Moderna, which was working with the NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The idea behind the mRNA vaccine platform is that it delivers snippets of a target viruss genetic codein this case, code in the form of mRNAinto human cells. Those cells can then translate that code into viral protein. From there, the immune system can mount a response to the protein, which can be activated if the target virus ever tries to invade.
In the case of mRNA-1273, researchers used a fatty nanoparticle to package up mRNA that codes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is usually found jutting out from SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.
Vaccines using genetic materialRNA or DNAare new and untested. So far, there are no approved vaccines using this type of platform. Its unclear if they will be successful here or elsewhere andif they arehow easy it will be to manufacture such a vaccine on a global scale. (For background on the different types of vaccine platforms, see our vaccine primer.)On July 14, researchers published results from a phase 1 trial, which primarily looks at safety in a small group of people. The study, appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, included 45 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 and tested three dose levels of the vaccine. That is, there were three groups of 15 people, with each group getting either a low, medium, or high dose of the vaccine (25 micrograms, 100 micrograms, or 250 micrograms dose). Each participant got two shots of their dose, 28 days apart.
The vaccine was generally found to be safe. More than half of the participants had mild to moderate side-effects, mainly including fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Side-effects were more common after the second dose, regardless of the strength, but those who received the two higher-dose vaccinations reported more side-effects. Two people (one in the 100-microgram group and the other in the 250-microgram group) had severe skin redness at the site of the injection. Two people in the 250-microgram group experienced lightheadedness and fainted.
All participants produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with antibody levels jumping up after the second shot. Those who got the higher doses had slightly higher levels of antibodies. The researchers compared participant antibody levels to those seen in 41 people who had recovered from a COVID-19 infection. Those vaccinated all had antibodies in the same range as the recovered people.
The researchers also tested specifically for neutralizing antibodiesthat is, antibodies that dont just bind to a virus particle but can completely disable it. Researchers found that the vaccine prompted higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than was seen in most of the people who recovered. For instance, 57 days after the first dose, people in the 100-microgram group had neutralizing antibody titers ranging from 163 to 329, while the range was about 60 to 200 in the patients who had recovered from COVID-19.
Last, the researchers looked at responses from T-cellswhich can attack cells infected with virusand found that the vaccine did generate certain types of T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2.
Overall, the results are encouraging but not conclusive. Researchers dont yet know what immune responses or levels of antibodies are necessary to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or disease. And, being only six months into the pandemic, its unclear how long any such protective immune responses would last.
According to a listing on the NIHs registry for clinical trials, Moderna plans to begin a phase III trial of mRNA-1273 on July 27. Moderna wants to enroll 30,000 people in the trial, looking at efficacy as well as further safety and immune response data.
AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19): Oxford University, AstraZeneca
On July 20, researchers published results from a phase I/II trial of AZD1222, a candidate vaccine made by researchers at the University of Oxford and the international pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.
AZD1222 (also called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) is a viral vector-based vaccine. With this platform, researchers can package bits of a dangerous virus into a far less dangerous virus. The mostly harmless viral parcel then gets delivered to the immune system, which can learn to seek and destroy the dangerous virus based on the smuggled fragments.
In the case of AZD1222, genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is packaged into a weakened type of adenovirus that infects chimpanzees. Human-infecting adenoviruses normally cause mild infections, often considered common colds. The chimpanzee virus, which doesnt typically infect humans, is made even more harmless by engineering that prevents it from replicating in human cells. In early tests, AZD1222 protected monkeys from developing pneumonia after researchers exposed them to high doses of SARS-CoV-2.
The clinical trial results, published in The Lancet, show that AZD1222 is generally safe and spurred immune responses in humans. The trial involved 1,077 participants (aged 18 to 55), 543 of which were randomly assigned to get AZD1222, and the remaining 534 were given a meningococcal vaccine as a control. Researchers divided the participants into four groups and ran different types of tests on their immune responses. Ten of the participants who received AZD1222 were in a boost group that got a second vaccine shot after 28 days. The other participants who received AZD1222 only received one dose.
Mild side-effects from AZD1222 were common, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise. Some participants were preemptively given paracetamol (acetaminophen/Tylenol) to lessen these effects. No serious side effects were reported.
In 127 participants vaccinated with AZD1222, all produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The levels were within the range seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19. The researchers conducted two separate tests to look for neutralizing antibodies in 35 vaccinated participants. In one test, 32 (91 percent) were positive for neutralizing antibodies 28 days after vaccination and, in the other test, 100 percent were positive. The ten participants who got a booster shot all produced neutralizing antibodies, some which were at levels higher than those typically seen in the COVID-19 recovered patients. The researchers also reported that AZD1222 induced T-cell responses.

19 with 17 posters participating
The Trump administration is threatening to sue states and municipalities whose pandemic orders infringe on people's rights or cause ""undue interference with the national economy.""
""I am directing each of our United States Attorneys to also be on the lookout for state and local directives that could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens,"" US Attorney General William Barr wrote yesterday in a memo to all 94 US attorneys' offices. The Barr memo said that ""even in times of emergency, when reasonable and temporary restrictions are placed on rights, the First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers."" The memo is available at The Washington Post website.
Barr's memo is not just aimed at protecting members of religious groups. He continued:
The legal restrictions on state and local authority are not limited to discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers. For example, the Constitution also forbids, in certain circumstances, discrimination against disfavored speech and undue interference with the national economy. If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court.
Barr wrote that he is ""therefore directing the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and Matthew Schneider, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, to oversee and coordinate our efforts to monitor state and local policies and, if necessary, take action to correct them."" While Barr said US officials ""do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,"" he noted that ""the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.""
Disturbingly close to house arrest
The memo did not detail what kinds of restrictions would cause the United States to sue states or cities, and it did not say whether the US will challenge any measures that are already in place. But Barr wrote that local restrictions, while ""necessary in order to stop the spread of a deadly disease,"" have ""imposed tremendous burdens on the daily lives of all Americans.""
Barr previously criticized local policies in interviews, saying that ""the idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest,"" according to a Fox News article last week. ""We're looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,"" Barr said. ""And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they're not and people bring lawsuits, we file [a] statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.""
The Justice Department has so far ""intervened in only a single lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions, appearing to back a Greenville, Miss., church which had sued over the city's efforts to shut down drive-in religious services,"" The Washington Post wrote. The Justice Department ""did not unequivocally support Temple Baptist Church in its legal statement of interest, though it said the circumstances the church described 'suggest that the city singled out churches for distinctive treatment,' which would be unconstitutional.""
Trump threatened states
President Trump on April 13 claimed he has ""total"" authority to override governors and force states to reopen their economies even while the coronavirus pandemic continues. ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be. It's total, and the governors know that,"" Trump said at a press conference.
That isn't how it works, as states and local governments have police powers to protect the health and safety of residents with measures such as isolation and quarantines. But Trump's claim and related developments showed that at least some states aren't likely to succumb to federal pressure to reopen their economies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would not follow a presidential order requiring him to lift pandemic orders. Shortly before Trump's claim, coalitions of governors on the East and West Coasts announced pacts to follow science, not politics, in their decisions on when to reopen economies.
Trump backed down just one day later, saying ""I'm not going to put pressure on any governor to open."" However, Barr's letter signals that the Trump administration is not done pressuring states to lift pandemic orders."

3 with 3 posters participating
New York Attorney General Letitia James hasn't been impressed with Amazon's response to the coronavirus crisis.
""While we continue to investigate, the information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon's health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,"" James' staff wrote in an April 22 letter first obtained by National Public Radio.
The crisis has produced surging demand for Amazon's delivery services. But as Amazon has hired an extra 175,000 people to help fill orders, it has also faced criticism about its safety practices. Last month, a number of workers (Amazon counted 15, organizers claimed 60) protested outside a massive Amazon fulfillment center on Staten Island. Amazon has also seen sporadic online protests in recent weeks.
The Staten Island protesters wanted their facility shut down for a deep cleaning. Amazon workers have also called for universal paid sick leave and stronger efforts to keep workers separated during work hours.
But Amazon says that it is doing everything it can to protect its workers from the coronavirus.
""We made over 150 process updatesfrom enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like disinfectant spraying,"" a spokeswoman told Ars by email. ""We distributed personal protective gear, such as masks for our employees, and implemented disinfectant spraying and temperature checks across our operations worldwide.""
In their letter, New York officials also questioned Amazon's decision to fire Chris Smalls, one of the organizers of the Staten Island protest. Smalls accused Amazon of retaliating against him for his organizing efforts. Amazon insists that Smalls was fired for defying a stay-at-home order after he came into contact with an infected co-worker.
James' office writes that their findings so far ""raise serious concern that Amazon may have discharged [Smalls] in order to silence his complaints and send a threatening message to other employees that they should also keep quiet about any health and safety concerns.""
""This Office has learned that many workers are fearful about speaking out about their concerns following the termination of Mr. Smalls' employment,"" the letter added. ""This is a particularly dangerous message to send during a pandemic, when chilling worker speech about health and safety practices could literally be a matter of life and death.""
But Amazon says it has done nothing wrong.
""We did not terminate Mr. Smalls employment for organizing a 15-person protest,"" Amazon said by email. ""We terminated his employment for putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of his employment. Mr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.""
Amazon says Smalls was instructed to stay home for 14 days after he came into contact with a coworker who had COVID-19 and that Smalls came to work anyway to help lead the protest.
Whatever the reasons for Smalls' termination, a leaked internal memo suggests that Amazon may have had a deliberate strategy to make him the face of worker organizing at Amazon.
Hes not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how were trying to protect workers, Amazon's general counsel wrote."

Before his sad eyes scour your soul.

Cloud-connected, ""smart"" automated pet-feeder system Petnet has had a rough spring. The service not only went offline in February, but all its customer service vanished, too, leaving users in the dark until the company apologized and pushed a patch more than a week later. The service briefly returned for some users, but fell off again in March. Now, after weeks of silence, the company is blaming COVID-19 for driving it offline for goodeven though its problems started weeks or months before the novel coronavirus became a significant concern.
Several Petnet customers began reaching out to Ars during the second and third weeks of April to report that, once again, not only were their feeders not working, but also they couldn't reach anyone at Petnet about it. Everyone's feeders didn't go offline at the same time but seemed to fail in slow sequence over the period between March 26 and April 13.
The company emailed its customers on March 26 blaming the novel coronavirus for outages and delays. The message, titled, ""Petnet: Impact of COVID-19,"" read:
Dear Petnet Customers,
The purpose of this outreach is to let you know how the COVID-19 crisis is impacting Petnet operations and your SmartFeeder usage. We work with a wide range of vendors, from other start up companies to well known establishments, to help provide convenience through a series of connected services.
One of our third party vendors has notified us that due to COVID-19 their operations are experiencing an adverse effect. We will monitor this situation closely and provide you with any updates as they arise.
Our service center is experiencing higher than normal ticket volumes, so our response time may take longer than usual. Thank you for your patience and for your understanding during this challenging time.
Best Regards,
The Petnet Team
The message to customers listed the same email (support@petnet.io) and Twitter (@petnetiosupport) handles the company has always used, but every reader who wrote to Ars said they were unable to receive support through either. The company tweeted on April 13 that it was experiencing ""a service disruption"" affecting both its first- and second-generation smart feeders. On April 14, Petnet posted another Tweet saying, ""We are still experiencing SmartFeeder connection downtime due to an ongoing service disruption that is currently being investigated."" As of April 27, that remains the company's last tweet.
Users looking for support received messages directing them to a third-party site called Tier One Success. Tier One bills itself as ""simplified customer support to help meet your Smart Home needs,"" but it appears to have almost no online presence outside of the link sent to Petnet device owners. Its only external communication is a Twitter account with 16 followers. The last time any message was posted to that account, in July 2019, Tier One indicated that it exclusively supported Petnet products and had not yet expanded to customer support for any other smart home device. 
Tier One at one time did post an open job listing on another site which described the firm as an ""in-house customer success team"" for Petnet. A LinkedIn bio for the person listed as the founder of Tier One, Joshua Bullock, is, to put it mildly, bare-bones and uninformative.
All complaints, however, whether addressed to Petnet directly or made through the Tier One support form, seemed to disappear into the ether. By April 16, all of the new customer reviews on Petnet's Amazon product listing were surmising the company had gone out of business, as were many tweets to @petnetiosupport and many reader emails to us.
Messages sent to email addresses posted by the company bounced back, as they had during the February outage as well. Ars was able to track down a working email address for a Petnet employee on April 23 and sent a message asking if the company was still operational.
Though the message was sent to a personal email address, the reply read, ""Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience our customers are experiencing right now"" and directed us to contact Petnet CEO Carlos Herrera, providing a phone number.
A few hours later, Petnet users began receiving an email explaining that the company was, more or less, going out of business. Several forwarded their copies to Ars.
""Last week on April 14, 2020, we briefed all of our customers regarding one of our third-party connected vendor's inability to fully resource their company and stay functionally online,"" the message reads. ""As of this writing, this situation remains unresolved but we are confident it will be overcome soon.""
But due to the exceptional circumstances the COVID-19 pandemic has created, Petnet went on, many of its vendorslargely startups like itselfwere ""severely and negatively affected in their day to day operations."" In short: the funding dried up. Due to a lack of funds, Petnet said, it ""re-prioritized and reorganized [its] resources,"" including:
<ul><li>We have furloughed 100% of our remaining staff.</li><li>We have ceased all future product development including bug fixes.</li><li>We have turned off all non-infrastructure related expenses.</li><li>We have terminated our office lease and are working remotely.</li><li>We have applied for all available CARES stimulus funding.</li></ul>
As Ars readers noticed back in February, however, the company's office space has been available to lease for quite some time, possibly as far back as October 2019.
Ars left a voicemail message at the number given to us for Herrera; we'll update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, it seems like a good bet that anyone who actually wants their automatic pet feeder to work should probably be shopping for a new product."

25 with 22 posters participating
President Trump yesterday threatened to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization and withdraw the US from the WHO entirely.
In a letter to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump alleged that ""the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world"" and that the WHO must ""demonstrate independence from China.""
""[I]f the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization,"" Trump wrote. ""I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to nance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America's interests.""
Trump posted the letter on Twitter, writing, ""It is self-explanatory!""
Trump has repeatedly denied any responsibility for COVID-19 spreading in America and said on April 14 that the US would temporarily halt funding the WHO until his administration completed a review of the group's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump's letter yesterday said that ""review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization's alarming lack of independence from the People's Republic of China.""
Trump previously said his administration was considering various proposals, including one in which the US would pay only 10 percent of its former contribution to the WHO. The US would have to exit WHO in order to stop funding it entirely because the group charges membership dues. The US also makes voluntary contributions to the organization.
Trump letter makes false claim
Trump's letter then lists a series of claims, the first being that the WHO ""consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal.""
The Lancet quickly issued a response explaining that Trump is wrong. ""This statement is factually incorrect,"" The Lancet said. ""The Lancet published no report in December, 2019, referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China."" The Lancet's first reports on the topic were published on January 24, 2020 the statement said.
""The allegations leveled against WHO in President Trump's letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic,"" The Lancet said. ""It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.""
A WHO spokesperson told Ars today that ""WHO acknowledges receipt of the letter from the President of the United States. We are considering the contents of the letter."" Last month, the WHO responded to Trump's temporary funding freeze with a call for global unity in the fight against the virus.
Trump may not be able to permanently end funding to the WHO unilaterally. The Wall Street Journal wrote last month that ""congressional Democrats say Mr. Trump can't cut WHO funding on his own,"" but that the ""White House budget office has concluded the president has several options to withhold money from the WHO without congressional approval,"" such as by ""order[ing] agencies to reroute the money to other related purposes.""
Trump still focused on travel ban
The US generally provides about 15 percent of the WHO's budget and gave the organization $893 million during the WHO's two-year funding cycle that ended on December 31. The US was reportedly already late on its payments to the WHO when Trump announced a temporary funding freeze.
Trump's letter yesterday said, ""Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged 'transparency.'"" Trump's letter did not mention that Trump himself praised China for its ""transparency"" on January 24 or that Trump repeatedly praised China for its coronavirus response throughout February.
Trump is also still mad at the WHO for its response to his travel ban. Trump wrote:
You also strongly praised China's strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were ""causing more harm than good."" Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world.
Despite Trump's claim, a USA Today article on April 11 said, ""there is no public record of WHO at any point actively criticizing the US or any other country for deciding to implement a coronavirus-related travel ban"" and that the WHO ""opposes all travel bans during a pandemic, not just Trump's."" The WHO on January 24 said it ""advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event.""
Health experts say Trump's travel ban had little effect on the pandemic's spread. Trump continued to downplay the virus's severity by comparing it to the flu as late as March 24, nearly two months after the WHO declared a global health emergency. Trump has also fought state governors over their cautious approaches to reopening the economy.
""I'm tired of those who bear the responsibility accepting none of it while deflecting blame on others, [including] the previous administration, the World Health Organization, the Wuhan lab, anywhere but where the blame belongs,"" US Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) said last week at a hearing on a whistleblower complaint that says the Trump administration's COVID-19 response was hampered by cronyism and denial about the virus's severity."

Starting in May, Airbnb will strongly encourage hosts to sanitize rooms after visitors leave using new, comprehensive cleaning guidelines. In addition to that, hosts will have to leave at least 24 hours between one visitor leaving and another one coming in.
These new cleaning guidelines, geared toward Covid-19 prevention, recommend masks, gloves, and specific disinfectants. Hosts can enroll in the cleaning protocol program and get certified, which will show up on their Airbnb profiles. In other words, you'll know if a host has adopted the new cleaning standards.
SEE ALSO: Who to follow on Twitter for legit, trustworthy coronavirus info
According to Airbnb's press release, hosts can choose not to commit to these guidelines. But they'll need a 72-hour buffer between guests. 
Airbnb hosts had to cancel and refund bookings once the coronavirus pandemic started, hemorrhaging money in the process. The company set up a fund to offer some relief to those hosts, and these new policies could potentially bring some of that lost business back.
One could argue strenuous cleaning standards should have existed before the pandemic. But once people feel comfortable traveling again, they can at least get the peace of mind that comes from a sanitized bedroom."

OK, so like most of the famous Simpsons predictions, it isn't exactly a prediction of 2020, but it is pretty damn close. 
Twitter user @didgeridougrou posted a viral tweet on Tuesday, in which they surfaced an old clip from the animated series that sure seems a lot like our plight in 2020.
In the clip, Springfield townsfolk clamor and shout at Dr. Hibbert for a cure for a disease, but the doctor tells them bedrest is all he can prescribe. And despite the Gilead drug Remdesivir getting FDA approval to help treat COVID-19 patients, Hibbert's proclamation that there is no cure sure sounds a lot like coronavirus. 
Next in the clip, the panicked townsfolk accidentally unleash killer bees in a truck, which, yep, sounds a lot like murder hornets. It's all pretty eerie. 
The Simpsons predicting the future is a well-trod trend. Everything from smartwatches, to corporate mergers, to Game of Thrones plot-twists have seemingly been predicted by the show. 
Of course, given more context, the 1993 episode didn't really predict 2020. The clip comes from the 1993 episode ""Marge in Chains,"" during which the town is hit with an epidemic of the fictional Osaka Flu. The sickness is played off in a cartoonish, funny way, with clouds of the illness strutting around town. 
Memes replacing the Osaka Flu with coronavirus actually first began going around in February, well before the added bit of ""killer bee"" coincidence. Unfortunately, some trolls also used the '93 episode to spread racist imagery, unlike the more recent viral tweet.
""I don't like it being used for nefarious purposes,"" episode co-writer Bill Oakley told The Hollywood Reporterin March. ""The idea that anyone misappropriates it to make coronavirus seem like an Asian plot is terrible. In terms of trying to place blame on Asia I think that is gross."""

The nation's top health official appeared before a House panel on the coronavirus response. 
It went so far that Fauci eventually literally waved off the congressman. 
In his questioning, Jordan wondered why church services were discouraged even as Black Lives Matter protests which are outdoors, typically involve mass mask-wearing, and have not been shown to significantly spread COVID continued across the country. Jordan seemed intent on getting Fauci to discourage protests or make a political statement of some sort.
""Well, I'm not going to opine on limiting anything. I'm telling you what the danger is,"" Fauci said to Jordan. ""You can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds no matter where the crowds are."" 
But Jordan wouldn't let up. Speaking with a public health official who's been doing this sort of work for decades, Jordan insisted over and over and over, trying to corner Fauci into coming out for or against the recent protests. Fauci, time and again, simply told Jordan that crowds particularly without masks could help increase the spread of the virus. 
Right as Jordan's time expired, the congressman still stuck on his same point, Fauci had a perfect reaction. 
It sure seems like Fauci had enough. And who could blame him for waving off Jordan? 
There is still so much we don't know about this virus. But we do know being indoors, sans masks, talking loudly, singing, or breathing heavily for extended periods of time is really dangerous. That's why health experts say bars, churches, and gyms are hotspots, not because the experts are out to get conservatives. On the contrary, they're trying to save lives. 
Here's the GIF of Fauci isolated, in case you ever need to use it:"

U.S. president Donald Trump has been bullheadedly charging forth with his plan to reopen the country, clinging to his idea the coronavirus will magically die off despite actual people dying by the thousands right now. 
""Your strategy for dealing with coronavirus is 'Eventually everything dies'?"" asked Meyers.
Meanwhile, two White House staffers have tested positive for COVID-19, prompting management to encourage remote working. It seems that, if it's not good enough for Trump, it's still good enough for everyone else.
""Think about that. The president is telling people to get back into the work force while his own White House tells employees to stay home,"" said Meyers. ""One day he's going to call a press conference to reassure us that murder hornets are fake news while a dozen of them carry him back to their nest.""
Trump also appeared on Fox News to deliver possibly the worst Mother's Day message a U.S. president has ever delivered. F-35 fighter jets were mentioned more times than mothers were which wasn't really a feat considering Trump's Mother's Day message referenced moms exactly zero times.
""Wow. Pretty sure even an F-35 pilot can write his mom a card without mentioning the F-35,"" said Meyers."

So it's probably not ideal that a bench-clearing brawl a fight apparently partially instigated by a coach, no less resulted in a whole mess of people moshing together, screaming and punching. 
It all started when one player, the Oakland Athletics Ramon Laureano, was hit by a pitch thrown by Houston Astro Humberto Castellano. Laureano seemed to be fine, if in a little pain. But things escalated, apparently after Houston batting coach Alex Cintron started talking with Laureano. Soon enough people were rolling on the ground, trading punches, and, importantly, breathing all over each other in close quarters. If someone in this fight had coronavirus, it's not hard to imagine the virus being spread during the scrap. 
Here: Look at this stupid mess.
Here's a video just showing the start of the fight. You can see Cintron yell at Laureano before retreating behind a wall of Astros players.
Laureano has been hit by a pitch three times in three games against the Astros. Oakland batters have been hit a total of five times during this three-game series. The Astros are now infamous for carrying out a massive, high-tech cheating scheme that helped the team win a World Series in 2017.
It's not totally clear why so many players had been hit, but it sure seems like retaliation. Oakland pitcher Mike Fiers, who did not pitch in the series, was the player who went public and unveiled Houston's rampant cheating. 
That tension boiled over with the massive brawl, which resulted in players in the stands even jumping onto the field to fight. It seems likely Laureano and Cintron will be handed suspensions at the very least. 
""Ramon's not going over there for no reason,"" Oakland Manager Bob Melvin said, referencing Houston coach Cintron, according to ESPN. ""I think the league will know who that is and that person will get suspended. Hopefully that's the case. Nowadays without fans in the stands and mics everywhere my guess is they know who it is.""
Suspension are fine enough. But it was plainly dumb for the teams to fight in the first place. MLB just last week introduced stricter coronavirus guidelines after the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals had wildly large outbreaks. Among the rules: everyone has to wear a face covering while not actively playing. 
A mask-less wrestling match/brawl is a flagrant violation of the new rules. So sure, the teams might face punishment. But if things like this continue, it's hard to imagine MLB making it through an entire season."

Rony Abovitz, Magic Leap's Chief Executive Officer, confirmed the news following an earlier Bloomberg report that stated the augmented reality startup was ""cutting half its workforce.""
According to sources close to the matter, that's about 1,000 employees. 
Abovitz took to Magic Leap's site to express the news in a blog post, citing COVID-19 as the reason for a company-wide restructuring. 
""To better prepare Magic Leap for the future, we have taken a close look at our business and are making targeted changes to how we operate and manage costs. This has made it necessary for us to make the incredibly difficult decision to lay off a number of employees across Magic Leap,"" he said in the statement. 
This doesn't come as much of a surprise considering that, back in December, it was reported the company's sales numbers were way worse than expected. 
According to The Information, the company only sold 6,000 headsets out of its target goal of 100,000. 
Sure, Magic Leap came back and said the report was inaccurate, but the company didn't provide any metrics to prove the numbers were wrong either.
At least this time around, the startup is being a bit more transparent when it comes to its current status and the future of the company.
So, what is next for Magic Leap after all this? 
For starters, the company has decided to concentrate strictly on the enterprise side of things rather than consumer. And, they're also going to continue to work on a ... second-generation Magic Leap.
Clearly, not even a pandemic can stop them from trying to get this thing right. 
""Adapting our company to these new market realities and our increased focus on enterprise means we must align our efforts to focus on the areas of our business that advance our technology, ensure delivery of Magic Leap 2, and expand product-market fit and revenue generation,"" Abovitz expressed later in the blog post.
Given the reactions to the first Magic Leap, let's hope that ""increased focus"" also includes a design revamp for its next AR headset. Because everyone's right, it's ugly."

In more ways than one.
Lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder went viral last weekend after lurking around Florida beaches dressed as death himself in protest of beachgoers enjoying the sun without proper social distancing, putting their communities at risk of COVID-19. While many states around the country are extending their stay-at-home mandates, others, like Georgia, are easing into reopening nonessential businesses. 
Uhlfelder is not a fan he, along with health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, are cautious of society returning to normal so soon. He made an appearance on a local ABC station Friday to warn Floridians against flocking to beaches while the pandemic rages on.
And obviously he did it dressed as the Grim Reaper. In the most 2020 scene imaginable, reporter Faith Graham handed the mic over to the death himself for comment. 
""I'm a huge proponent of public beaches and I've been fighting for that for years, but I think the danger of bringing people here to the area and spreading the virus,"" the Reaper appeared to say. ""I think it's going to prolong the recovery we have and I think that we should take better measures...It's too soon and it's not appropriate."" 
It's something. So is Graham's full report, below.
Personally, I thought the Grim Reaper would sound more soulless than Uhlfelder, but the lawyer does bring a sobering visual to the beach. The Centers for Disease Control still recommends staying at home, washing your hands, and covering your face if possible to avoid contracting and spreading the coronavirus. 
And if you think for a second that you should attend a large gathering, just think of the Reaper."

But highly protective yet scarce N95 and surgical masks need to be reserved for healthcare workers, so those who aren't on the frontlines should instead resort to buying or making masks with other fabrics. 
Researchers now suggest that a combination of cotton with natural silk or chiffon (yes, the material many nighties are made out of) could effectively filter out airborne particles. Since the coronavirus can be spread through respiratory droplets say when an infected person coughs or sneezes University of Chicago professor Supratik Guha and his fellow researchers set out to determine which readily available materials best filter out the droplets. 
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus sparks black market filled with fake and stolen N95 face masks
In an article published by the American Chemical Society, the researchers explained how they came to their conclusion. After producing particles in an aerosol mixing chamber, they used fans to blow the particles at different fabrics at the same rate a human would at rest. They then measured the size of the particles before and after passing through the fabrics. 
As it turns out, one layer of tightly-woven cotton combined with two layers of polyester-spandex chiffon filtered out around 80 to 99 percent of particles, making it the most effective. The researchers also got similar results substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, as well as using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting.
These results are comparable to the effectiveness of N95 mask material, but Guha and his team also emphasized the need for masks to fit correctly. Just a one-percent gap can reduce the mask's efficiency by half, or more. 
If you need help making your own mask at home, you can learn how to do that right here."

On Sunday evening, Katmai National Park and Preserve home to the livestreamed bear cams   announced ""multiple cases"" of COVID-19 at Brooks Camp, the place where visitors come each summer and fall to see the park's famous brown bears and migrating salmon. The infections, which forced a temporary shutdown of the camp, underscore how easy it is for this new coronavirus to spread between people anywhere, largely through airborne transmission.
""The primary transmission of COVID-19 is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets,"" says the CDC, who notes transmission can happen from ""those with mild symptoms or those who do not feel ill.""
Naomi Boak, the media ranger at Katmai National Park and Preserve, wrote an online message Sunday that the park began weekly testing for its staff last week, whose rangers are exposed to visitors who aren't required to wear masks. Additionally, staff like Boak quarantined for two weeks near park headquarters before flying out to Brooks Camp. 
""But this virus is sneaky and it came to us despite best efforts,"" Boak wrote.
""I am one of those who tested positive,"" she said.
Due to positive test results, the Brooks Camp Developed Area (BCDA) will close starting 12:00am 7/27 through 8/10. We will bounce back from this setback after all appropriate measures are taken for us to reopen safely. Areas outside the BCDA remain open.https://t.co/IJR8mY9OzFpic.twitter.com/DzashWTQDR

Regarding ""hygiene theater,"" I've said it before, and I'll say it again: we should be spending at least as much time and attention on distancing + masks + avoiding crowds + good ventilation indoors as we do on hygiene. https://t.co/s48mziIEd5

It's clear that transmission can happen anywhere, though wearing masks over one's nose and mouth has proven to significantly reduce the spread of the virus.
We are not defenseless against COVID-19, CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield said in a statement. Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. 
Masks are especially critical because, unlike SARS (also a coronavirus) or Ebola, which sicken people relatively quickly
, many folks infected with this coronavirus are healthy carriers. This means they can unwittingly spread the microbe (even by talking
) while they feel fine. Some asymptomatic people are coronavirus ""super-spreaders.""
 
This coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is still a newly emerged human pathogen, so there's little overall human immunity to a virus with a mortality rate ""substantially higher than that of most strains of the flu,"" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
""It has everyone on the planet to attack,"" Dan Janies, a professor of bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who researches viruses, told Mashable in May.
SEE ALSO: National parks' prized safety system fails during the coronavirus pandemic
Already, the new coronavirus has killed over 146,000 Americans (as of July 27). In a typical year, the flu kills 12,000 to 61,000 people in the U.S., according to the CDC.
There are certainly smart ways to significantly reduce the risk of spreading or catching the new coronavirus, like when camping. But there's no way to completely eliminate risk. Though researchers have made promising, rapid vaccine advances, it's unlikely a vaccine will be tested, produced, and widely distributed until sometime in 2021."

What if, they ask, I already had COVID-19 weeks ago but didn't realize or couldn't confirm it? 
The search terms ""did I have coronavirus"" spiked in Google Trends early last month, when it became clear the United States was on the cusp of major outbreaks. People also Googled ""did I have coronavirus in January"" and ""did I have coronavirus in February."" 
Soccer star Carli Lloyd wondered as much on Twitter in late March, detailing symptoms similar to those caused by COVID-19, including a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. 
""Beginning to think my husband and I had the Coronavirus back in mid February,"" she wrote. ""A sickness we have never felt before."" 
Her replies were full of people wondering about the same scenario in their lives. 
It's a simultaneously compelling, legitimate thing to ask and a kind of fantasy that we might indulge in because the alternative constantly worrying about contracting a highly infectious fatal disease is exhausting. The anxiety of extreme social distancing and panic buying might be more tolerable if people knew they'd already survived asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases of COVID-19.  
SEE ALSO: Wearing a coronavirus face mask isn't about you
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is elusive, which means, as far as we know, the risk of contracting COVID-19 remains high. This is particularly true because people who are asymptomatic can infect others, undermining a key assumption about how viruses are transmitted. 
There are now more than 370,000 known cases and 12,000 fatalities in the U.S., and public health authorities stress that the only way to stem infections and prevent more deaths is to continue practicing social distancing, hand washing, and other preventive measures. 
In order to know how many people in the U.S. have been infected with COVID-19, we'd need widespread availability of highly accurate tests that detect the presence of antibodies against the disease. We also need more scientific information about how long immunity to the disease lasts once someone acquires it. Immunity to common colds, which are caused by coronaviruses, is temporary. Even if someone accurately suspected they'd come down with COVID-19 earlier this year, it doesn't necessarily mean they'd continue to be immune to the virus in the coming months or years. 
Then there's the question of whether the timeline makes sense. Prior to the known outbreaks, could people have developed mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 without a simultaneous uptick in severe cases that would've required hospitalization? 
Nicholas Reich, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst whose lab focuses on understanding and modeling infectious disease, has been looking for evidence of this happening, and so far sees little data to support that possibility. 
For the last two months, @cmyeaton and I have been leading a weekly analysis of publicly available influenza-like illness (ILI) data and flu test results from the @CDCFlu and state health departments. https://t.co/KrqgiKoyxE1/
 Nicholas G. Reich (@reichlab) March 27, 2020
He and his lab members noticed influenza-like illnesses increase in December and January and thought perhaps coronavirus had been silently circulating for months. They decided to look at the rate of influenza-like illnesses alongside the rate of negative flu tests as a potential signal of community spread of COVID-19; if illnesses rose but more flu tests came back negative, it could suggest another pathogen playing an unexpected role. By late February, the lab's analysis showed trends that were consistent with historical norms. 
Since then, when the lab looked at patterns in March, they saw deviations from the historical norms but it was difficult to draw strong conclusions from that data. 
More people went to the doctor with respiratory illnesses and also tested negative for the flu, but Reich said that could be the result of people changing their behavior as media coverage of coronavirus ramped up. In other words, more people sought medical attention for various symptoms because of alarming headlines about COVID-19 but may not have had the disease. The researchers couldn't rule out COVID-19 spreading earlier than thought, but the data also suggested that if the coronavirus had been present, it would've been relatively limited. 
Reich believes it's plausible that someone in the vicinity of a hot spot like Seattle or New York could've developed COVID-19 in mid-February, as the disease began to spread throughout communities. 
""Outbreaks like this take time to build up steam and really start to burn,"" he said. 
Still, given the severity of COVID-19, Reich believes it's unlikely that coronavirus was widespread prior to late February and early March. That would've been accompanied by what we're seeing now, and saw in Italy: a fraction of patients streaming into emergency rooms with respiratory distress. 
""Outbreaks like this take time to build up steam and really start to burn.""
""Based on everything thats been coming out, Ive been increasingly feeling as though it wouldve been really hard to miss a large outbreak,"" said Reich. ""Data points like [what's happening in Italy] make it clearer to me just how this is really different from seasonal flu."" 
Reich also points to genomic analyses of the coronavirus conducted by Trevor Bedford
, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which suggest
 that the first known
 COVID-19 case in the U.S. occurred in mid-January, in Washington state. That research  looked at minor mutations in the virus' genome to analyze when it might have emerged in the U.S.  If that analysis is accurate, it would make it far less likely that the disease caused mysterious respiratory illnesses in late 2019 or early 2020. 
Ruth Collins, an associate professor of molecular medicine at Cornell University, said it's very likely that a different, nasty virus could've been circulating this winter. Since the symptoms caused by coronaviruses overlap significantly, it would make sense that some people experienced an awful illness that wasn't actually caused by COVID-19 but still produced similar symptoms like coughing, fever, and aches and pains. 
Collins said that wondering about whether an illness experienced prior to the coronavirus outbreak was in fact COVID-19 is a form of highly relatable wishful thinking. 
""It's part of human psychology,"" she said. ""We always want to think were better than we are, that we got lucky, that we escaped it somehow."" 
It doesn't help, either, that tests to diagnose COVID-19 have been difficult to get. 
In the absence of diagnostic testing, we need widespread individual and epidemiological testing to determine who contracted COVID-19 and developed antibodies to the disease. That requires highly accurate serology tests, or blood-based tests, that detect the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Such testing is being rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the government agency is focusing on areas that became hot spots. Antibody tests are not widely available, and though there are efforts to make them accessible to the public, it's not clear when they will be.  
Collins also said that antibody tests, like any other test, can be unreliable, producing both false negatives and false positives. Tests, for example, might not pick up antibodies present in small amounts because immunity declined, even if the person was infected. 
What we need is more conclusive medical and scientific research on how COVID-19 is transmitted, particularly through asymptomatic people, and a more precise tally of how many people have been infected. Individual access to accurate antibody tests will be important to answering the lingering question about potential infection, but it's still unclear how long immunity lasts.  
In the meantime, suspicion of a COVID-19 infection without confirmation is no reason to relax social distancing or hygiene practices. 
""This thing is not going to go away fast,"" said Collins. ""Weve got to know more about how the disease spreads. The idea of testing will give some level of confidence, but it wont be enough until we know more about how the disease is transmitted."""

You can read the full statement below. The company didn’t directly address instances where tip baiting has happened or say if it would adjust behavior. It does have a few mild measures in place to discourage zeroing out tips, however, such as forcing customers to manually set the tip to $0 and setting the default to at least 5 percent even if it was lower for the last order.
It’s a complex situation. The ability to change tips after delivery is commonplace among grocery and restaurant delivery apps, and is meant to protect customers against shoddy service. Instacart shoppers, for example, are theoretically more likely to treat you well if they know you could reduce their tip. However, many of these app-based workers also depend on tips to make a decent living — the absence of a guarantee for their tips could leave them in financial distress. If the FTC intervenes, it may have to strike a careful balance where it both protects workers and gives customers a way to address poor service.
“Our goal is to deliver a high-quality experience for both customers and shoppers. By allowing customers to tip after delivery based on their overall service, we see shopper tips increase or stay the same on 99.5% of orders. Additionally, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in North America, shoppers' earnings from tips have nearly doubled. Tips are always separate from any Instacart earnings and all tips go directly to the shopper.”"

Facebook didn’t specify exactly who was behind the effort, only that the “investigation found links to individuals associated with QAnon.” 
Facebook’s Head of Security Policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said the accounts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic, but that “we’ve seen them opportunistically leverage COVID-related topics.” 
Examples of the posts shared by the QAnon-linked accounts removed by Facebook.
“They frequently posted about news and topics including the upcoming presidential election and candidates, the current US administration, anti-Semitic and anti-Asian conspiracies, and COVID-19,” Facebook wrote in a report on the takedowns. “While it did not appear to be the focus of this campaign, some of the individuals behind this effort attempted to monetize their clickbait content by selling t-shirts and other merchandise.”
As NBC News points out, the pages  represent only a “fraction” of QAnon supporters’ Facebook presence. While Facebook aims to debunk and hide conspiracy theories and misinformation, the company doesn’t remove posts that don’t otherwise violate their rules. 
Together, the five pages, 20 accounts, and six groups reached more than 150,000 Facebook users, the company said. One hundred and thirty-three thousand users had followed at least one of the pages, and 30,000 had joined at least one of the groups. While that’s a tiny subset of Facebook’s 195 million US users, it still highlights how a small number of “fringe” accounts can gain relatively wide distribution on the social network."

But it's unclear whether the patients fared better because of the famotidine or if it was a coincidence.
""Based on what we've learned in this study, it's encouraging,"" said Dr. Joseph Conigliaro, a coauthor of the paper and a physician at Northwell Health. ""This association is actually really compelling.""
The drug, famotidine, has been on the market for nearly 40 years and is an active ingredient in the popular over-the-counter heartburn treatment Pepcid.
Among the 1,536 patients in the study who were not taking famotidine, 332, or 22%, either died or were intubated and put on a ventilator. Among the 84 patients who were taking famotidine, 8, or 10%, died or were put on a ventilator.
""Compared to the rest of the patients, those who received famotidine had a greater than 2-fold decreased risk of either dying or being intubated,"" according to a statement by authors of the study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. 
The patients who were taking famotidine started the drug within 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital. Some took it orally and some intravenously, at varying dosages. About 15% of them were already taking it at home. 
The study doesn't prove the drug caused the lower death rate -- it's possible that it's just a coincidence.
""It is not clear why those patients who received famotidine had improved outcomes,"" the authors wrote in their statement. ""This is merely an association, and these findings should not be interpreted to mean that famotidine improves outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.""
Doctor cautions against starting famotidine
The study was published on medrxiv.org, a preprint server founded by Yale University, the medical journal BMJ and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Articles on this server have not been reviewed by authors' scientific peers.
Based on these results, Conigliaro said he knows that doctors might start prescribing famotidine to their coronavirus patients now, before the results of the clinical trial are known, but he doesn't recommend it.
""I think doctors should wait for more data from the prospective trial,"" he said.
He added that there's no evidence famotidine prevents infection, and he's concerned that people who don't have Covid-19 will start taking it.
""I would really caution against this. Taking famotidine might give them a false sense of security,"" he said.
Only a clinical trial, where patients are randomly assigned to get either famotidine or a placebo and then studied, can determine if the drug really works against Covid-19.
Northwell and Columbia are now doing a clinical trial where some patients are receiving intravenous famotidine at a dosage nine times higher than what is given for heartburn. Others are receiving a placebo, or a drug that does nothing. Conigliaro, who's heading up that trial, said preliminary results would likely be announced in a few months.
He said 233 patients have been enrolled in the study, and Northwell had planned to announce preliminary results when they enrolled 390 patients. However, since the number of patients with coronavirus in New York has declined, they might decide to announce the preliminary results with fewer patients. 
'We don't know if it has any benefit'
It has a bit of a mystery why a heartburn medicine might help someone with a viral infection.
""A month ago when we were approached with the idea to start up the trial, I really did a double take,"" Conigliaro said.
The Northwell doctors decided to study famotidine for two reasons.
One, a computer modeling study showed that the famotidine's mechanism of action -- the way it fights heartburn and reflux -- might also help against Covid-19.
Two, Dr. Michael Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who worked with coronavirus patients in China, observed that lower income patients with heartburn were surviving longer than their wealthier counterparts who also had heartburn.
When Callahan and the Chinese doctors looked closer, they found that many of the people with lower incomes were taking famotidine, whereas the wealthier patients tended to take a different, more expensive drug.
""The poor peasants really seemed to do well on famotidine,"" said Dr. Kevin Tracey, president of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, said. ""There are a lot of anecdotes passing around that give us some hope.""
While these observations in China -- and now New York -- might point the way to famotidine as a treatment for Covid-19, the researchers emphasized that only the clinical trial can determine for sure whether the drug works against the virus. 
""We don't know if it has any benefit. We really don't. I swear we don't,"" Tracey previously told CNN. ""People are hoping for anything. But we need to do this clinical trial.""
He added that if famotidine works, it would be easy to use it on a widespread scale.
""It's generic, it's plentiful and it's inexpensive,"" he said."

""From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,"" Van Kerkhove said on Monday.
""We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They're following asymptomatic cases, they're following contacts and they're not finding secondary transmission onward. It is very rare -- and much of that is not published in the literature,"" she said. ""We are constantly looking at this data and we're trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.""
Van Kerkhove went on to describe how the novel coronavirus, a respiratory pathogen, spreads through droplets, which can be released when someone coughs or sneezes.
""It passes from an individual through infectious droplets. If we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases, isolated those cases, followed the contacts and quarantined those cases, we would drastically reduce -- I would love to be able to give a proportion of how much transmission we would actually stop -- but it would be a drastic reduction in transmission,"" she said.
Van Kerkhove also said that what appear to be asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 often turn out to be cases of mild disease.
""When we actually go back and we say how many of them were truly asymptomatic, we find out that many have really mild disease,"" Van Kerkhove said. 
""They're not quote-unquote Covid symptoms, meaning they may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath -- but some may have mild disease,"" she said. ""Having said that, we do know that there can be people who are truly asymptomatic.""
Many people with Covid-19 who may appear to be asymptomatic actually could just have mild or atypical symptoms -- or they could be pre-symptomatic, Dr. Manisha Juthani, an infectious diseases specialist and associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine, said in an email to CNN on Monday.
Pre-symptomatic refers to the early stages of an illness, before symptoms have developed, whereas asymptomatic may refer to having no symptoms throughout the course of an infection -- a distinction that Van Kerkhove hinted at during Monday's media briefing.
Juthani, who did not participate in the media briefing and has not reviewed the unpublished data Van Kerkhove cited, said those findings are not necessarily inconsistent with other estimates regarding how pre-symptomatic spread of the coronavirus can occur. 
A study in April found that viral shedding -- when people may be able to infect others -- could begin two to three days before symptoms appeared. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in planning scenarios that 40% of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick. 
""These patients weren't asymptomatic,"" Juthani said. Rather, they were ""spreading disease before becoming symptomatic.""
Overall, ""these findings suggest that if we quarantine and contact trace symptomatic people, we can make a significant dent in the pandemic,"" Juthani said.
Making this distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections remains important -- but also between ""paucisymptomatic infections,"" which refers to having atypical or very mild symptoms, Babak Javid, a principal investigator at Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing and consultant in infectious disease at Cambridge University Hospitals, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Monday.
""Detailed contact tracing from Taiwan as well as the first European transmission chain in Germany suggested that true asymptomatics rarely transmit. However, those (and many other) studies have found that paucisymptomatic transmission can occur, and in particular, in the German study, they found that transmission often appeared to occur before or on the day symptoms first appeared,"" Javid said in the statement.
""Other data available, from studies in several continents confirming that presymptomatic transmission does occur, would suggest that being well does not necessarily mean one cannot transmit SARS-CoV-2,"" Javid said in part. ""This has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries.""

After weeks of working on her submission, the Covid-19 outbreak not only canceled her prom but altered the course of her senior year.
Manker was not deterred by the fact that she would not get to wear her dress to prom. Instead, she felt inspired to create a dress that ""documents a part of history.""
Her coronavirus-themed dress features multiple images depicting life during the pandemic. Her vision for the dress began with wanting to capture her own experience. She represents her unforgettable senior year with a vibrant scene of students attending virtual graduation.
Manker's ideas evolved as the pandemic continued to impact people all over the world. 
""It wasn't just high schoolers, it wasn't just America, it was the whole world being impacted by the pandemic so I wanted to show that,"" said Manker.
She does so by showing an image of people running away from the giant coronavirus to signify the world trying to avoid catching the disease. Other designs pay tribute to frontline workers and people suffering from mental health issues as a result of the pandemic.
The Sparta, Illinois, high school graduate omitted no detail from her dress ensemble. She completed the look with a creative array of accessories including a ""flatten the curve"" face mask. Manker also crafted jewelry, shoes and a hair piece reading, ""separately together."" 
While Manker's favorite creation is her coronavirus-shaped purse, she believes that her anklet displaying the words, ""This too shall pass,"" perfectly encapsulates her message. She wants the people who see her dress to be reminded that ""even though it doesn't seem like it right now, the coronavirus pandemic will eventually pass, it will all be okay in the end."" 
Manker also wants to encourage a spirit of positivity with her work. She believes that ""we can have some positive things come out of this whole experience and my dress is an example of that."" 
It would be difficult to tell from looking at the pictures of her work, but Manker says this is her debut as a duct tape artist. Her previous experience is from making small duct tape wallets and flowers when she was much younger. Four months and 41 rolls of duct tape later, she managed to make something far more elaborate. 
As Manker prepares to leave for Southwestern Illinois College in the fall, she says the experience taught her that ""you can do a whole lot of things with duct tape.""
Manker's mother posted the dress to Facebook, where the post has been shared over 254,000 times. Manker says it is ""surreal"" that her work was able to make an impression on people all over the world who commented on the post. 
She says that winning the contest, run by duct tape-maker Duck Brand, would be rewarding because ""it will mean that people saw all the positivity I was trying to show them."" 
Duck Brand will be awarding $20,000 in cash scholarships to the winners in July."

View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)As the US grapples with Covid-19, its economic fallout, and the continuing anguish of racial injustice, many of us are struggling with our mental health. A Census Bureau survey found that one in three Americans are now reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety -- more than three times the rate from a similar survey conducted in the first half of 2019. 
It is no surprise that times of crisis affect our well-being. People experience mental health challenges due to economic downturns, natural disasters or other collective traumas. The surge in Covid-19 cases earlier this year may explain why a federal crisis hotline experienced an 891% increase in calls in March compared to the same period last year. 
To make matters worse, a critical way for us to reduce the spread of the virus is to physically distance ourselves from others -- our family, friends, coworkers, and communities. This is exacerbating the already widespread problem of loneliness, which is deeply harmful to both our mental and physical health.
The tragic deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and the ensuing fight for racial justice have added another layer of distress that is further compounded by the fact that African Americans and Latino Americans are three times as likely to get Covid-19 and twice as likely to die from it. 
They are also more likely to have essential jobs that cannot be done from home and put them at higher risk of Covid-19 infection. As the US now sees infections and hospitalizations surging in new communities, the mental distress of it all will only continue.
Those of us who are not experiencing severe acute symptoms from the stress of the moment are still affected in other ways. We may find we are more tired than usual and more likely to lose our tempers. We may eat more junk food and find it harder to concentrate at work and school. 
How can we address this wave of pain and mental stress that is washing over so many of us? To be sure, we must address the immediate challenges before us by organizing an effective response to the pandemic, providing financial help for those who are struggling and offering empathetic leadership to confront the systemic racism that has so long disfigured our country. 
This time has also highlighted the urgent need to overhaul our broken mental health system, where only 43% of people who needed help received any treatment in 2017.
This means making mental health services more widely available through telemedicine and in-person visits; ensuring that insurance companies truly pay for mental health services on par with physical health services; expanding funding for suicide prevention; addressing persistent workforce shortages by training more mental health professionals; and reducing the stigma that keeps so many from seeking help.
But there is a more fundamental obstacle to our mental health and well-being that is harder to see but essential to confront. In our fast-paced, mobile, and globalized world, we have allowed one of our most treasured sources of safety, resilience, and health to weaken and fray: our relationships with one another. 
Over the last five decades, the US has experienced a decline in social capital -- the network of social relationships, grounded in shared values and norms, that give us a sense of community and support. We have fewer close friends. We belong to fewer communal associations and places of worship. We have less trust in each other. 
Loneliness is surprisingly common, especially amongst adolescents and young adults. The physical distancing and isolation of Covid-19 -- in addition to the recent flare of police brutality and racial injustice -- threaten to exacerbate the sense of separation between people at a moment when we need more social support. 
This has serious consequences for our health. Loneliness is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety as well as heart disease, premature death and dementia. It is also associated with a shorter lifespan. One study found that the mortality impact associated with loneliness is similar to that observed with smoking 15 cigarettes a day. 
On a societal level, our weakened connections can make it harder for us to have honest conversations across political and social divides, which in turn makes it tougher to come together to address daunting challenges like inequality, climate change and a global pandemic.
There is a way we can use this moment of extraordinary pain and stress to improve our mental and physical health: we must rebuild and reprioritize our relationships with one another. Doing this demands that we re-orient the cultural lenses through which we see ourselves and each other. 
The values of consumer society (efficiency, wealth, professional success) and social media (sensationalism, us-vs-them rhetoric, curating one's life to seem perfect) are not working for us. This often leaves us feeling inadequate and unworthy, which in turn makes it harder for us to be open and vulnerable with others -- key ingredients to building healthy, strong relationships.
Instead, we must find ways to elevate our more enduring values -- kindness, honesty, courage, self-sacrifice -- and reflect these in our decisions and in the way we define success. 
Do we measure the potential of our children by their test scores or whether they make others feel seen and loved? Do we measure our success by how much we have, whether that's more status, more wealth, more likes and retweets? Or do we celebrate our efforts to build strong families and communities that work better for everyone?
During this time when so many are struggling, there are small steps we can take that can make a big difference. We can start by thinking of one person in our lives who may be frightened or lonely and making an effort to support them, whether that's lending a listening ear or offering to bring them a home-cooked meal. 
We can build uninterrupted time with loved ones into our days (even 15 minutes can make a difference). We can put away our devices and give people our full attention during conversations. We can seek out opportunities to serve those around us, recognizing that service is a powerful antidote to loneliness. 
These simple actions can change our lives for the better. When this action is taken collectively, it can help build a people-centered culture. 
As stressful as the pandemic has been and as many lives as the virus has devastated, it may provide us an opportunity to reassess our lived values and reprioritize our relationships with one another. 
Many Americans are rediscovering the richness of nightly family dinners and more time spent with children -- as challenging as that can be at times -- leading some of them to question whether our highly scheduled lives are always worth the trade-off. 
King Arthur Flour, which established its Baker's Hotline in 1993, has seen a surge in phone calls from people who are reaching out for baking advice. Some are simply calling to chat with a real person, which gives us a glimpse into what we lose when we replace in-person interactions with web searches. 
We have spoken with managers who found that seeking to understand the hardships their staff faced at home and establishing ways for employees to ask for and receive help from one another is helping build a thriving and productive workplace, challenging the notion that we're better off when we rigidly separate our personal and work lives.
Better policies are essential to improving our mental health and well-being. But policy ultimately flows from the culture and values that shape our decisions. This is our moment to re-center our lives and our country around a simple but powerful credo: put people first. Covid-19 is our opportunity to recommit to one another, to recognize that human connection is the foundation for greater health, resilience and fulfillment."

Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced new rules requiring international students to leave the United States if their colleges or universities institute online-only learning measures for the fall under the threat of Covid-19. 
It's another disgusting, transparent Trump administration attack on foreigners and immigrants, one that is solely about malice -- and one that further diminishes the United States' influence and reputation while putting human life at risk. 
With Covid-19 infections still raging across the country and on the rise in multiple states, colleges, universities and vocational programs are making tough decisions about the 2020-2021 school year. 
It's clear that in normal times, in-person classes have significant benefits over online ones. But these are not normal times and pulling large groups of students together in lecture halls is a practically ready-made scenario for Covid-19 transmission. 
Institutions of higher learning have an obligation to educate their students, and an obligation to keep them -- along with their faculty and staff -- safe. That means many are making the difficult and imperfect choice to put health first, and convene classes and lectures online. No, it's not ideal for everyone. But it's a heck of a lot better than mass illness and death. 
This administration disagrees. This feckless, ignorant President has already botched the Covid-19 response to a degree that would have been unimaginable under any previous executive in modern history.
And he still doesn't seem to get it: He's more concerned with his ratings and the appearance of normalcy than with taking the steps and making the hard choices that will save American lives and allow us, eventually, to return to actual normalcy. 
When colleges and universities take their classes online, that signals to Americans that we aren't safe yet. And this President seems to believe that's bad for his election chances in November. He tweeted in all caps Monday that schools ""MUST OPEN"" in the fall. 
At a broader level, this development shows how the Trump administration is capitalizing on Covid to support its long-standing anti-immigration agenda. This administration has already taken numerous steps to make the United States, a nation that owes so much to immigrants, less welcoming to those who would come to our shores. 
The President's travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries was met with protests across the nation, but after a little tinkering, the ban stood. 
The administration notoriously implemented a family separation policy that ripped children from their migrant parents, and threw many of them into bleak detention centers. At least seven children have died in immigration custody, and yet prominent members of the Trump administration reportedly have made clear that they are unmoved by the plight of families who suffer from this widely condemned and devastating policy. 
And now these new, absurd rules for international students. The ICE rule is a partial reversal of a rule issued early in the pandemic that allowed students taking online-only classes to retain their international student visas. 
This new rule will force thousands of students from other countries to return home if their colleges don't offer at least a hybrid model of in-person class time and online class time. The logic seems to be that students don't need to be in the US if they aren't going into a classroom; they can log on from anywhere.
Except, of course, they can't. Many international students rely on their school for consistent and free Wi-Fi; going home would mean limited or unaffordable internet access, or for many, no internet access at all. Students from developing nations or rural countries may not have internet. 
Countries like China, for example, radically restrict what internet users can access, potentially making it impossible for students to complete their research and coursework. And any student from the many nations outside of the Americas is going to be looking at an online class schedule that will be, for them, at all odd hours and in the middle of the night. 
And those are the lucky ones. Internationals are from a variety of backgrounds; they include refugees, students whose homelands have devolved into conflict, students whose countries of origin have been devastated by disaster, and students from extreme poverty. Not every international student has a home they can go back to. 
Not to mention the global health risks of forcing thousands of people from one of the countries hardest-hit by Covid-19 onto airplanes bound for every corner of the world. It's not clear that many of these students could even get back home if they wanted to, with nations closing airports, suspending flights, and seeing US travelers as particularly risky. 
But it's not just international students who are hurt by this policy; it's Americans, too, and our national interests. 
Having a wealth of experience, talent and perspective from a diverse student body makes all of our colleges and universities better; it encourages innovation, creativity and excellence. 
The American economy, American health care and the American people all benefit from the inventions, research and contributions of those who come to study in the US. 
So does American influence and soft power: Our phenomenal system of higher education is respected the world over, and international students who come to the US may in turn be ambassadors for the best of American values and aspirations, including free speech, equality, freedom of religion, diversity of experience and thought and at least a striving toward meritocracy. 
Previous presidents, even those with conservative views on immigration, have at least recognized that there is something important and strategic in educating the world's future leaders, influential thinkers, creators, great artists and innovators. 
And many of the rest of us understand that our universities, like our country as a whole, are stronger, better and more effective not just when they attract the world's best and brightest, but when they bring together a diverse group of curious, ambitious young people who learn not just from their instructors, but from each other. 
Unlike other Trump administration changes to immigration rules, there isn't even a pretext of a benefit here. This President and his lackeys at least claimed that previous policies were about protecting American jobs, defending national security or keeping Americans safe from crime. 
Those assertions were specious, cynical and easily debunked, but there was at the very least an attempt to say this was about putting America and Americans first. Here, they've done away with even that sham. 
This rule does not have to stay in place; it is so far more of a news release on guidance than a formal rule. DHS is expected to publish the formal rule soon, which means there is still time for the public to push back on it. 
Colleges and universities, too -- many of which are already responding to this potential purge with confusion and alarm -- should take this time to figure out a way to keep their international students in the country while keeping the whole campus community safe. 
It's appalling that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, any resources at all are going to the creation and, eventually, enforcement of pointless and unnecessary immigration rules that don't make a single person safer, but compromise the educations of thousands of students, and risk the health of thousands more people around the world to boot. 
There is no excuse; there is not even the whiff of a reason. Except: This President, and his administration, are reckless bigots who will hurt American interests if it means they can also hurt immigrants."

Trump's interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday was a fresh illustration of his strategy of obfuscation when he falsely claimed, once again, that case numbers are up across the country because of the increase in testing and claimed -- when told that coronavirus cases are up 194% -- that many of those cases are ""young people that would heal in a day."" 
At a time when the President has failed to offer any leadership on how to tackle the virus and tamp down the spread, he called the nation's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, ""a little bit of an alarmist."" Asked about the campaign to discredit Fauci by some of his advisers, Trump said Fauci ""made a few mistakes"" but insisted that he has ""a very good relationship"" with him. (In a new Fox poll, 74% of voters said they approved of the way Fauci has responded to the pandemic, compared to 43% who said that about the President). 
While Trump acknowledged that there is ""somewhat of a surge"" in the United States a vast understatement given that there have now been at least 3.7 million cases and more than 140,000 deaths in the US Trump went on to tell Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the US ""death chart"" is ""much more important"" than the fact that the US broke a new record last week in new cases in a single day (more than 77,000). 
The President claimed that the US has ""maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world"" and, during a quarrel with Wallace about those numbers, interrupted the interview to ask the White House press secretary to bring him a chart showing the mortality rate. 
Wallace noted that according to data from Johns Hopkins University, which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries, the US ranked 7th in its mortality rate, better than the United Kingdom but worse than Brazil and Russia. (Trump pointed to different data showing Italy and Spain doing worse than the US in terms of deaths, but Wallace noted that the chart did not include other countries doing better like Russia.) 
Meanwhile, 15 weeks until Election Day, Trump does not seem to be taking any steps to address the fact that most voters do not trust him personally -- as voters'poor marks for his handling of the coronavirus continue driving hisfalling poll numbers. 
A key factor in Trump's slide is the fact that a broad majority of Americans do not trust the information that he puts out on Covid-19. Only 26% of registered voters trusted Trump to give accurate information about the coronavirus, according to last month's New York Times/Siena College poll, while 77% of registered voters trusted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
CNN confirmed this weekend that the White House is resisting a Senate GOP request to increase funding for the CDC that would fund coronavirus contact tracing and testing in the next round of stimulus funding, a dispute first reported by The Washington Post. 
Americans may not respond well to that effort by the White House to limit funding. Thenew Fox poll also showed the rising concern among Americans about how the virus is affecting their lives: 29% said the coronavirus is the most important issue facing the country and former Vice President Joe Biden held a 17-point edge over Trump when voters were asked who would better handle the virus (a major jump from May when Biden held only a 9-point advantage over Trump on that issue in the Fox poll). 
Nearly 6 in 10 respondents said they were ""very concerned"" about the spread of the virus with a clear majority disapproving of Trump's handling. Most striking: there was a major increase in the number of voters who said coronavirus is ""not under control at all"" in the United States: 51% said that was the case in the new poll, compared to 33% who said that a month ago.
Despite Trump's new push to appeal to ""the suburbs"" by attacking Obama-era fair housing regulations that were aimed at desegregating those areas, a new analysis by CNN's Harry Enten shows that Biden is currently winning suburbanites by a historic margin.
Part of Trump's problem is the split screen of his continuing denials that the coronavirus is raging in the United States and the images of intensive care units in Miami-Dade County filled to 127% capacity as refrigerated trailers line up to serve as temporary morgues throughout the country. Each time he claims the administration is getting the virus under control, the data shows cases soaring in parts of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. 
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said that his city has ""never had as many people infected or infectious"" and told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he was on the verge of issuing a new lockdown order. 
""We've seen no national leadership, we've had to stand up testing centers on our own. We've had to do so much that is outside of our lane, because of the lack of national leadership,""Garcetti said, noting that it took Trump months to don a mask publicly, the simplest and most effective way to slow the spread of the virus. ""We were left on our own when we should have had help.""
""Stop telling people this will be over soon,"" Garcetti said. ""Let people know that this is a marathon that we have to kind of push through every single mile. And If we don't come together as a nation with national leadership, we will see more people die."""

There's so much of a push that some scientists think these treatments may be available this year, even before a vaccine. 
Antibodies are the proteins the body makes to fight infection.
Since the Victorian era, scientists have harnessed this natural protection for treatments. 
During the 1918 flu pandemic, doctors proved convalescent plasma -- antibody-filled blood plasma from patients who recovered from the disease -- could fight flu. Convalescent plasma has been used to treat severe flu, MERS and SARS and now some US doctors are starting to see some success treating Covid-19, too.
Since there isn't enough donated plasma to treat all patients, modern medicine can fill in the gaps and maybe even improve the process. Scientists can create what are called monoclonal antibodies: lab-made antibodies created specifically to target an infection.
Vaccines have the advantage of working longer than an antibody treatment. Antibody therapies potentially last a month or two and then wear off, but they can be used to temporarily protect vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents or healthcare workers or people with chronic conditions. The therapies could also treat people who are already sick with Covid-19.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said these therapies will be essential in the fight against Covid-19.
""Right now we have a major push on a program to develop monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune globulin, all of which are founded on the same principle of using an antibody that is directed against the virus for either prophylaxis or treatment,"" Fauci said in an interview with JAMA on June 8. ""I think you're going to see it's going to be for both. We'd like to have available for those who are at riskthe elderly and those with underlying conditionseither monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. That's a very, very high priority.""
Currently there are at least 102 Covid-19 antibody treatments in various stages of development, according to David Thomas, vice president of Industry Research at BIO, the trade association representing the biotechnology industry. Thomas does the research that goes into his organization's Covid-19 therapeutic development tracker. He said there are so many treatments under development, it's hard to keep up.
""I never looked at it to grow this big, this fast, and I've worked on all different therapeutic areas from Alzheimer's to cancer, and to see a pipeline of this size and this breadth is amazing,"" Thomas said. 
Thomas said some therapies are designed to treat the secondary effects of Covid-19 such as inflammation. Others are being designed to kill the coronavirus itself. 
Compared to other diseases, the research and development of Covid-19 treatments are moving at ""light speed,"" Thomas said. 
Four monoclonal antibody treatments made to treat and possibly even prevent Covid-19 infection already went into human trials in June. 
Indianapolis-based pharma giant Eli Lilly has two. One was developed in collaboration with AbCellera, a biotechnology company based in Canada. Another was developed with Junshi Biosciences. 
The antibody Lilly developed with AbCellera called LY-CoV555 is now in a Phase 2 clinical trial of non-hospitalized patients. That study is currently enrolling patients. Lilly said in the future it will also test additional antibodies and experiment with different combinations to see which work best. 
Regeneron is testing its antibody cocktail in patients in the US. The New York-based biotech company is enrolling hospitalized and ambulatory patients with Covid-19 in the initial safety/virology phase of the trial, spokesperson Alexandra Bowie said this week. The company hopes to have preliminary data in the next one to two months. They are scaling up manufacturing to create hundreds of thousands of doses by August 2020, dedicating their entire manufacturing plant in upstate New York to the effort.
There is also another effort from Tychan, a biotech company based in Singapore, that has launched a Phase 1 clinical trial in hospitalized patients there. The company said this part of the trial will take about six weeks.
It's likely, if all goes well in the first phrases of the trials, therapies could advance to the next phases sometime this summer, the companies said, and treatments could potentially be available by the fall. Although, some scientists say, not everything works as planned in real life.
""Sometimes antibodies that work in the lab and neutralized really well aren't as effective when they are used in animal models or humans, so it's always a little bit tricky,"" said Phyllis Kanki, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sometimes it can take time to get the antibody cocktail right, Kanki said.
However, Thomas of BIO,said the industry has built up a lot of antibody therapy development expertise over the years in creating treatments to fight cancer and autoimmune disease. 
In addition to therapies specifically designed to fight the novel coronavirus, companies are also looking to repurpose some of their existing monoclonal antibody treatments as potential Covid-19 treatments. 
Novartis, for example, is in a phase 3 trial of the drug canakinumab against coronavirus. This interleukin-1beta blocker is FDA-approved to treat certain rare types of periodic fever syndromes, also called auto-inflammatory syndromes.
The company hopes canakinumab can be used to treat patients whose Covid-19 infection has caused a condition called cytokine release syndrome, or cytokine storm. where the body's immune system overreacts to the infection and harms the body. That trial is currently enrolling patients in the US. 
China-based biotech company I-Mab said it also hopes to have the results by August from its trial of an antibody therapy, which it is currently testing on cytokine storm patients, so it could potentially offer a treatment by early fall.
Humanigen's lenzilumab also seems to be working against cytokine storms, according to a small study from scientists at the Mayo Clinic. That Phase 3 trial is ongoing.
Several other therapies are still being tested in the lab. A South Dakota company, SAB Biotherapeutics, said it plans to start human trials with its antibody treatment derived from the plasma of cattle in July.
Most experts think that the world could have an antibody treatment sooner than a vaccine, although vaccine development is moving along at a record pace, too.
""There's a lot of excitement around what these antibody therapies can do, at the animal level anyway,"" Thomas said. ""They were showing neutralizing activity and we're seeing a lot of positive data."""

But while this pandemic is unlike anything the world has faced in living memory, previous generations of children and youth have lived, grown and even thrived through great hardship. Their stories can be models of resilience, said children's book author and librarian Glenda Armand.
""You want to have role models for kids who are going through difficult times,"" Armand said. ""It gives them tools to cope with what's going on, and shows that these times don't last forever."" 
Armand, whose book ""Love Twelve Miles Long"" recounts the story of a young Frederick Douglass, noted that there are important lessons for today's children in even the grimmest periods of history. 
In a recent blog post, she wrote that her great-great grandfather Victor Jones Sr. was born into slavery, and that her writing for children about enslaved people is a way ""to recognize their strength, to honor their sacrifice.""
Reading about historic hardship can also offer valuable context, said children's literature expert Leonard Marcus. 
""Children tend to live in the present,"" he said. ""Part of their maturing and education is learning to put the present in a larger context."" 
That doesn't mean parents must turn reading time into a history class. Instead, sharing a book should be an opportunity to spark curiosity and conversations. ""I would start by really listening closely to your child's reactions,"" Marcus said. 
When it comes to younger children and picture books, Marcus suggested that parents cultivate their own curiosity, ""maybe pointing to one of the pictures and saying: 'What do you think is happening here? How do you think that character is feeling?'""
Children can learn resilience in all kinds of ways, Marcus emphasized. 
Their role models don't even have to be human, he said, noting that he loves the Newbery Award-winning chapter book ""The One and Only Ivan,"" whose protagonist is a gorilla held captive in a shopping mall. (The 2020 movie will be released in August.)
""It's a book about empathy,"" he said, ""so it has a lot to offer without being obvious about it.""
What topics are kids ready to face?
Caregivers worried children aren't ready to encounter stories about slavery, war and hardship might be surprised by what their kids have already noticed, Marcus said. 
""I think parents tend to be overprotective and to assume too little about what children know and care about,"" he said. ""Kids are often self-regulating to a degree that parents don't realize."" 
""Most kids are pretty curious about things,"" agreed Kirby McCurtis, president of the Association for Library Service to Children. ""They see things and want to ask questions, so you can just go with the child as your lead."" 
If your child is experiencing grief, loss, fear or other hard feelings, the books can be a way to explore them, McCurtis said. ""A child who might not be ready to talk about a challenging subject they can see themselves in a book."" 
For older kids, McCurtis said that not only can reading help with coping and processing, but that stories can be a bridge to reimagining the future. 
""With teens there are so many dystopian novels,"" she said. ""That's an easy way to make that connection because right now feels a bit like a dystopian reality. That can be a really interesting coping mechanism for teens, but it's in a different way. It's sort of like: Let's get creative in the aftermath.""
These are some expert-recommended books for kids of all ages learning to cope, put things in context and get creative.
Books for elementary school children
Explore the importance of love and family in Armand's book ""Love Twelve Miles Long,"" which imagines the powerful connection between a young Fredrick Douglass and his mother in 1820s Maryland. While the story itself is fictional, Armand scoured Douglass' three autobiographies for details that inform the text. 
Follow a child facing disruption and disaster in ""Kenta and the Big Wave,"" by Ruth Ohi, a fictional book based on the true story of a 2011 tsunami that ravaged the Japanese coast. Kenta loses his soccer ball in the aftermath of the wave, but the ocean brings it back. 
Jim Crow-era racism and the Great Depression are the setting for ""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,"" the finale of Mildred Taylor's four-book series of novels on the Logan family, which highlights how strong relationships can offer resilience in hard times. 
Books for middle school children
Despite the terror and ultimate tragedy of 13-year-old Anne Frank's two years spent hiding in an attic during the Nazi occupation of Holland, her writing in ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"" offers moments of hope. ""In spite of everything I still believe people are really good at heart,"" she wrote. 
Based on the life of Juana Maria, an Indigenous Nicoleño women who survived alone on California's San Nicolas Island for nearly 20 years, ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" by Scott O'Dell is a story of incredible resilience. In the fictionalized book version, 12-year-old Karana learns to fend for herself while coping with loneliness.
When young Kek immigrates from Sudan to Minnesota in the novel ""Home of the Brave"" by Katherine Applegate, everything changes. He's grieving lost family and adjusting to a new place; making friends helps soften the transition. 
Dust storms devastate 14-year-old Billie Jo's Oklahoma farming community in the free-verse ""Out of the Dust"" by Karen Hesse. The Newbery Award-winning book shows the terrible toll of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, with a young protagonist who keeps fighting despite grave setbacks. 
Hanno sees his twin brother killed in 1945 Germany, then joins forces with 14-year-old Effi as he tries to survive the aftermath of the Second World War in the novel ""Last Train From Kummersdorf"" by Leslie Wilson. 
The fictional teenage protagonists of John Green's ""The Fault in Our Stars"" find romance and humor while facing down cancer and looking for deeper meaning. Love, loss and mortality are powerful themes in this engaging story. 
A family tragedy unfolds amid genocide in the autobiographical ""First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of the Cambodian Genocide Remembers"" by Loung Ung. The author's family moved between work camps run by Pol Pot's regime, and Ung survived in part thanks to her family's frank discussions of the dangers they faced. 
Follow high school heroine Emily Bird through a world coping with deadly pandemic in Alaya Dawn Johnson's ""Love Is the Drug."" Bird's hometown of Washington, DC, is quarantined, which heightens the tension of the book's teen drama, romance and intrigue.

For those planning a family vacation or simply wishing to travel to another state, it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest statewide regulations. 
There are some states that do not have restrictions. For those that do, here is a list of what each state is mandating.
Beginning on August 11, nonresidents have to arrive with a negative Covid-19 test that was administered 72 hours or less. There is one other testing option.Travelers who opt for testing five days or less before arrival must be retested at the airport and limit their interactions until the test returns negative.
All travelers also must complete a traveler declaration form and receive another Covid-19 test seven to 14 days after arriving in Alaska. 
Travelers can opt out from taking Covid-19 tests, but they must self-quarantine for 14 days or the duration of their stay, whichever is shorter. 
According to the CDC, ""people in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department."" Leaving your home state to enter a state with a mandatory quarantine means you need one place to stay and to stay put.
Any traveler coming from a state that has a positive rate of 10 out of 100,000 people or a 10% or higher positivity rate must self-quarantine for 14 days. The traveler must have spent more than 24 hours in said state for the rule to apply. Everyone also needs to complete a travel health form.
Visitors can opt out of the 14-day quarantine if they can provide proof that they have had a negative Covid-19 test in the past 72 hours.
There are currently 34 states on the 10% or higher positivitylist.
People traveling from Connecticut, New Jersey and New York are required to self-quarantine for 14 days once arriving in Florida. Some exceptions include those involved in commercial activity or for any academic purpose such as internships. Everyone is responsible for their own costs that are involved with quarantining. 
Upon arrival, passengers are required to sign a form saying that they know about the 14-day quarantine and that it is a criminal offense should they violate it. 
For travel between islands, a mandatory form must be submitted online within 24 hours of departure. Passengers cannot fly if their temperature is above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. 
In Ada County, which includes Boise, travelers coming from outside Idaho are encouraged to quarantine for 14 days.
There are no statewide restrictions, but a 14-day quarantine is required for visitors heading to Chicago from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah and Wisconsin. 
Travelers need to quarantine for 14 days if they have traveled to Florida or been on a cruise. Travelers must also quarantine if they traveled to Arizona between June 17 and July 27 or if they've traveled to a country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice With Restrictions. Some countries include the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Brazil and China. 
Travelers must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival or sign a form stating they've received a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours. Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Vermont are exempt from quarantining or having a negative test. 
Maryland residents who travel out-of-state need to have received a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival or get tested as soon as they return. Nonresidents should be tested within 72 hours of arrival and quarantine until they receive a negative result. If their test is positive, it is recommended that they cancel their trip. 
Any resident who travels outside of Maryland to a state with a coronavirus testing positivity rate of more than 10% needs to self-quarantine until a negative test result is received. The District of Columbia and Virginia are exempt from this rule. As of July 31, the states include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas.
Beginning August 1, travelers must complete a travel form before arriving in Massachusetts and quarantine unless they are traveling from a lower-risk state, which the Department of Public Health designates. Visitors can also provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test that was taken up to 72 hours before the trip. Travelers waiting on test results need to quarantine until they receive their negative results.
All travelers to New Jersey from states that have a Covid-19 testing positivity rate of 10% or higher or have 10 people test positive for every 100,000 residents is asked to quarantine for 14 days. This rule does not apply for visitors spending less than 24 hours in the state.
The state government is also asking travelers to fill out a voluntary survey regarding information about where you are traveling and your destination. 
As of July 31, there are 36 states and US jurisdictions on the list.
As of July 1, those traveling from out-of-state are required to self-quarantine for 14 days or the length of their stay in New Mexico, whichever is shorter.
There are 36 states currently on the list. 
Those traveling by airplane must fill out a travel form before exiting the airport or face a fine of $2,000. Those traveling to New York through other methods such as cars and trains must fill out the form online. 
Travelers visiting Ohio from states reporting positive testing rates of 15% or more must self-quarantine for 14 days. As of July 29, the states currently include Arizona, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas and South Carolina.
Visitors traveling from states with a high number of Covid-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days. As of July 24, they are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
Those traveling to Rhode Island from a state that has a positive testing rate of 5% or more must quarantine for 14 days. Travelers can opt out of the quarantine if they can provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of their arrival. 
Those waiting on test results must self-quarantine until a negative test result arrives. However, the state still recommends quarantining for 14 days as opposed to relying on a negative test result.
Vermont is allowing visitors to self-quarantine before they travel as long as they use a personal vehicle to travel. They must make minimal stops and follow precautions such as wearing a face mask or covering, washing their hands and staying six feet apart. They must self-quarantine for 14 days or for seven days if they receive a negative test.
If travelers use public transportation such as an airplane or bus, they must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival or for seven days followed by a negative Covid-19 test. 
There are currently 27 states on the list. 
There is no statewide quarantine mandate, but all visitors coming from elsewhere to Wisconsin are being asked to stay home as much as possible for 14 days upon arrival while checking for Covid-19 symptoms. Within Wisconsin, it is not recommended that people travel to other private or rental homes within the state."

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)These five words may be the most un-Trumpian thing Donald Trump has ever said: ""It is what it is."" 
He said it in an interview with Jonathan Swan, of Axios, who asked how Trump could argue that the Covid-19 pandemic was ""under control"" since ""1,000 Americans are dying a day."" Trump responded, ""They are dying, that's true. And you have it is what it is. But that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can. It's under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us.""
""It is what it is"" is a phrase that football coaches lean on after their teams embarrass themselves on the field. President George W. Bush reportedly said it, too, when he was informed, wrongly as it turned out, that he was in danger of losing the 2004 election to John Kerry. 
But not Trump. In a long career -- in real estate, reality TV and the White House -- Trump has reached often for exaggeration and falsehoods to convince people it is what it isn't.
At another point in the Axios interview, more in character, he praised his administration for doing a ""great job"" on Covid. 
""This was not Trump's first failed interview,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""Nor did it break entirely new ground in laying bare his inability to grasp basic concepts, his disregard for American lives, his narcissism and pettiness. But the interview did reveal a new set of outrageous and alarming moments from the man who, regrettably, is in charge."" For example, Trump proved reluctant to praise John Lewis, the civil rights hero who died last month, and instead carped about Lewis not attending his inauguration.
""When it comes to literal life and death national security issues Trump continues to cling to a transparent and jaded ignorance-is-bliss card,"" Samantha Vinograd pointed out, after the President defended his failure to act on allegations that Russians put bounties on the heads of US soldiers in Afghanistan. He said the intelligence never reached his desk. ""Purposely staying unintelligent and uninformed is the most un-American thing a president can do,"" said Vinograd.
Trump's reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin mystifies his former advisers, wrote CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. They've told him ""that Putin is aware of Trump's admiration for him and has sought to exploit it. They see the results in Trump's near mimicry of Kremlin talking points, on everything from election interference, to bounties on US troops in Afghanistan, to his understanding of Europe.""
At key moments, Dr. Deborah Birx has been the face of the White House's effort to fight the coronavirus. Widely respected for her years of work on HIV/AIDS, Birx has lately been the target of criticism from some medical experts and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She even drew fire from President Trump, after she acknowledged the ""extraordinarily widespread"" nature of the pandemic in the US. A fellow expert on infectious disease, Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, wrote, ""All of her work shows Birx to be a sophisticated physician-scientist with genuine interest in the health of vulnerable and underserved populations."" 
But he argued that as response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Birx has made ""a real hash out of the entire effort, with a series of poor decisions -- changing hospital data reporting protocols for coronavirus patients to cut out the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and report directly to Health and Human Services, painting a rosy picture of the problem and of the President's engagement and still developing no national plan for testing, tracking, opening schools and businesses."" 
Still, Birx could do the US a service by speaking out publicly about what has gone on behind the scenes, Sepkowitz wrote. ""The cruelest trick of Trump and his group is this: they rely on the decency and the sense of historic order of those whom they destroy to keep their secrets secret.""
America's poor performance in the pandemic isn't only the result of an inept response from the government, wrote Dr. Akash Goel, Michel Nischan, Dr. Bill Frist and Tom Colicchio. The food system is killing us. ""Among the most significant risk factors for hospitalization and death in Covid-19 are the presence of diet-related chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and obesity. America's starting point? Nearly three out of four American adults are overweight or obese."" 
One of the biggest Covid-related questions facing Americans right now is whether to send children back to school. Biologist Erin Bromage said his are going back but acknowledged that the decision is made easier by the fact they attend private school in an area where community transmission of the disease is low. 
""Make no mistake,"" he advised parents, ""if there is community transmission in your local area, once schools resume there will be infected children and staff within those school walls. And once they are in the school, you are relying on the mitigation efforts the school has put in place -- masks, physical distance, ventilation and filtration of air, outdoor teaching -- to stop within-school transmission."" 
On mask wearing, Dean Obeidallah offered a simple parallel to those who refuse. ""Cigarette smoking has been banned in various states and countless municipalities across the nation for the simple reason that smokers have no right to kill me or my family with their second-hand smoke. The same philosophy must also apply to wearing a mask to protect others from Covid-19: No one has the right to kill anyone else with their 'second hand' germs."" 
There's one thing Joe Biden doesn't lack in his search for a running mate: advice. 
Each of the likely candidates has enthusiastic backers. For Jen Psaki, the ideal choice is former national security adviser Susan Rice. ""She is not only smart as hell, she is funny, outspoken and has a fiercely loyal group of women around her,"" wrote Psaki, who worked with Rice in the Obama administration. ""Susan gives hugs, isn't phony, and won't be bamboozled by Vladimir Putin or Mitch McConnell."" 
Van Jones wrote, ""Sen. Kamala Harris appears to be the front-runner -- and for very good reasons. ... She is tough, smart and experienced -- having already served ably in local, state and federal office."" Jones argued that Biden should pick a Black woman, and he listed five others along with Harris, ""all of whom would make outstanding candidates and vice presidents."" 
Biden is said to be evaluating candidates on a variety of factors, but to David Gergen, the supreme question is this: ""If history calls, will his vice president have the capacity and talent to become a first-class president?"" 
In 2008, Republican candidate Sen. John McCain shocked the political world with his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for his running mate. That is the kind of surprise Joe Lockhart said Biden should avoid at all costs. Biden's ""pick needs to be designed to maintain the structure of the race rather than changing the dynamic. The very last thing he needs now is to spring a surprise on all of us."" 
For more on the 2020 campaign:
As white smoke billowed out of a warehouse Tuesday at the port of Beirut, an enormous explosion, captured on video as a gigantic red flash, decimated the area, killing at least 158 people, wounding more than 5,000 and forcing half of the city's population out of their homes. The blast was attributed to a huge cache of ammonium nitrate stored at the port.
""Everything that could go wrong in Lebanon has,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""The blast came in the midst of an epic economic collapse and a global pandemic, with political factions fighting each other as the people, growing hungry, have alternated between despair and rage ...
""Perhaps the shared anger over this event can bring the Lebanese together to push back against the incompetent and the greedy, the functionaries, politicians, and outside players, who have hijacked their country and created conditions for the Lebanese people's never-ending tragedy; admittedly a monumental task.""
Democrats and Republicans remained far apart last week on the outline of a new pandemic relief bill. The jobless rate in July, although modestly lower than in June, was 10.2% -- a number slightly higher than the peak of the Great Recession. But there was no agreement in Congress on extending any portion of the $600 a week in extra aid for the unemployed. On Saturday, Trump signed executive actions that could provide additional aid and defer payroll taxes for some workers, but they face serious hurdles.
Among the hardest hit industries is restaurants, John Avlon noted: ""Independent restaurant owners face an economic apocalypse."" The industry employs ""11 million Americans, with an economic impact that is felt up and down the supply chain, from farmers to fishermen,"" he wrote. Often barely eking out a profit pre-pandemic, restaurants faced closure at the beginning of the crisis, and now, in many cases, are trying to survive on takeout or outdoor dining. Restaurants are backing legislation to create a $120 billion federal grant program. 
""Once the weather turns cold, the outdoor seating work-arounds will no longer be operative -- and without a vaccine, many will be forced to close their doors forever,"" Avlon wrote. ""Those closed storefronts will make our communities less safe and less distinctive."" 
When the pandemic began, several large grocery chains initially gave their workers hazard pay, since they were more likely than most people to be exposed to the coronavirus. Sen. Kamala Harris and Marc Perrone, head of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, wrote, ""Given the seriousness of this pandemic, and the essential jobs they do, the time has come to reinstate hazard pay for all of America's grocery workers."" 
August marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the vote and will be celebrated on Women's Equality Day, August 26. 
Today it's viewed widely as the long-delayed but almost inevitable political empowerment of more than half the population. So, it's surprising to read, as Nicole Hemmer recounted, that more than a few of the activists opposing suffrage were women. 
""The women who opposed women's right to vote have often been left out of the story of suffrage,"" Hemmer wrote. ""Talk of women's interests, like the interest of other marginalized groups, often trades in flat stereotypes, treating all members of the group as though they think, and vote, the same. But as the anti-suffragist women show, women have been shrewd political actors, understanding -- and protecting -- their sources of power in unexpected ways.""
What drove these activists? ""They made the patriarchy work for them by setting up shop in the informal spaces of political power: the organizations, charities and associations that allowed them to expand their dominion over the private sphere into issues like public education and public health. They feared that, were women given the vote, they would lose their place of privilege and influence in these areas.""
Hemmer sees echoes of the anti-suffrage women in the activists, led by Phyllis Schlafly, who fought off the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, a story told in the recent FX series, ""Mrs. America.""
Michelle Obama and Melinda Gates 
In a piece for CNN Opinion, Michelle Obama and Melinda Gates expressed concern about students like Fortunate Ayomirwoth, who lives in a suburb of Kampala, Uganda. Her school has been closed since the pandemic erupted, they wrote. While Fortunate does chores and cares for four younger siblings, she hopes ""there will be enough food to eat. Since her mother lost her job, money has been tight -- and for Fortunate, her window of opportunity feels like it, too, is getting tighter."" 
""We know from past crises, like the 2014 Ebola outbreak, that adolescent girls in low and middle-income countries are particularly at risk of being overlooked and left behind,"" noted Obama and Gates. ""During a crisis like this one, adolescent girls face a heightened threat of physical and sexual violence, early and forced marriage, and unintended pregnancy on top of sustained economic hardship."" 
""Even a temporary disruption to girls' education could have devastating long-term impacts. Unless we act, the pandemic could trap a generation of girls in a cycle of poverty -- and shortchange the world of the talents and ideas these girls have to offer."""

 (CNN)Many governors are opening up their states as part of the White House effort to reopen the country. But as a pandemic expert who has been warning about diseases like Covid-19 for nearly 15 years, my message to Americans is simple: save yourselves, your families and your communities by staying at home and ignoring your governor's ""ludicrous"" policies.
Citizens should know that reopening states is very unlikely to restore economic well-being. In fact, prematurely reopening society would likely cause the disease to escalate and lead to prolonged economic hardship. Every public interaction will endanger our health, causing sickness and death and further burdening our healthcare system. Other countries could forbid their citizens from visiting the United States, and Americans could be barred from much of the world. Even trade may be viewed as an unacceptable risk. 
But, based on research I've conducted, I believe that if we take a more aggressive approach now and keep towns and cities locked down, we can defeat Covid-19 in four to six weeks. This would allow enough time for those currently infected -- and anyone they may have infected -- to recover or seek medical treatment.
More than a dozen countries have flattened the curve and substantially decreased daily new infections by ensuring strong lockdowns, facemasks for everyone, strict travel restrictions and isolation of infected individuals away from home. Countries that have not imposed sufficiently strict measures, like the US, continue to struggle to contain infection rates. 
But even within the US, some local and state governments are doing the right thing and succeeding. New York City and Louisiana are now at one-fourth to one-third of the daily cases they registered at their peaks. Every community, large or small, that implements strong measures will see the same success. But we need strong commitment to do what it takes to win quickly and decisively at the level of the individual, family and community.
In March, I called on the US to impose a strict five-week national lockdown with internal and external travel restrictions to bring us to near zero infections. While measures were taken in many parts of the country, it was too little, too late. 
Now, I and many others are issuing another warning: the decisions of some US governors to prematurely ease social distancing is a disastrous mistake and citizens need to ignore them. Our research -- and common sense -- show that lifting social restrictions will lead to an explosion of Covid-19 cases and cause countless more deaths. The correct way to relax restrictions is to start with parts of a state that are Covid-free for 14 days and allow only essential travel to those parts of the state with 14-day quarantines for inbound travelers. 
Why will going along with reopening lead to catastrophe? 
First, we must understand that coronavirus is very deadly. Those who claim the death rate is exaggerated are plain wrong and downplaying the emergency. While death rate estimates have varied, recent data from China, the United Kingdom and France, reflecting deaths outside hospitals, including in nursing homes, puts the Covid-19 global fatality rate at around 6.8%, based upon analysis we did at endcoronavirus.org, using data from Johns Hopkins University.
Second, almost all reopening states, from California to Pennsylvania, currently have a critical mass of new cases of existing infections that could see new outbreaks in the coming days and weeks. 
Third, without extreme preventive measures, we've seen how coronavirus infections doubled every two to three days at one point in different areas -- which equated to about a tenfold increase per week. That means that a state with 1,000 new cases could have well over 100,000 more in two weeks, if social distancing is loosened. 
States like Texas have announced precautions to mitigate harm from reopening with measures like limiting restaurants and shopping malls to operating at a 25% or 50% capacity depending on the amount of cases in their areas. But we know from months of studying this disease that communities need more aggressive measures to stop the exponential spread of Covid-19.
We prevented the contagion from being much worse by putting in place protective measures throughout the US. We expanded testing capacity. We ramped up our hospitals' capacity to care for critically ill patients. But this ""flattening the curve"" isn't enough. If we lighten up on our protective measures now, all the progress we've made will vanish, and we'll suffer an enormous setback. We need to push even harder to win.
My plea to everyone who lives in states that are reopening is simple: Recognize that your leaders have made a terrible decision. Don't be fooled that it's safe to return to work, go to the barber shop or have a sit-down meal in a restaurant. Protect yourself, your family and your community. Choosing to protect those you love is a heroic act.
Instead of venturing out for leisure or work, safely volunteer, taking all precautions if you go outside. Work with your local community organizations to ensure your neighbors have access to homemade cloth masks. Help organize transportation to testing sites for anyone who shows symptoms. Work with your community leaders to identify locations, such as hotels or dormitories, where infected individuals can isolate so they don't infect relatives and housemates. Partner with your local health authorities to organize monitoring teams to safely go door to door, identifying neighbors with symptoms who need isolation space and support. 
Instead of opening up now, local business leaders can find ways to support their communities in preventing transmission and being safe. Their actions will come around to help them when the community can open safely, soon.
I have great hope that individuals throughout our country will choose the heroic path. We can crush coronavirus. As too many government leaders fail us, I call on every American to lead the way."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)In his public career, Vice President Mike Pence has stressed the power of prayer and been a skeptic about science. 
At one point, he said that smoking doesn't kill and he refused to acknowledge the vast evidence that the planet is warming at an alarming rate that imperils us all. Now, in the age of pandemic, he is publicly running around without a face mask and insisting that it's OK for others remove theirs. In Pence's world (or maybe it's President Donald Trump's world) it seems that real Americans cough, sneeze and breathe free.
Let's be clear about the science behind the federal recommendation that everyone wear a mask in public settings, where social distancing is hard to maintain. 
It is based on simple logic. When you wear a mask, you are protecting others because you may have picked-up the Covid-19 virus without knowing it. It's better to cover-up than to potentially kill someone with germs you might spread.
Just before Pence made an appearance for a roundtable discussion with five food industry executives in Iowa on Friday, a White House staffer told the executives that they could remove their masks before Pence made an appearance if they wanted to. CNN, citing a source familiar with the situation, reported that the aide ""didn't ask and she didn't tell"" them to do so. The source also noted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines that masks are not necessary if people can maintain a distance of 6 feet. 
Although the staff member may not have forced anyone, it's safe to bet that perhaps the executives felt some pressure. First, who says no to a suggestion made by someone from the White House? Second, this is an administration that has been quite open about its disdain for medically and scientifically sound advice. Even the two execs who run meatpacking plants where hundreds of workers have been infected removed their masks. 
Prior to this Iowa trip, Pence had learned that his aide Katie Miller tested positive for the virus.
One would think that even if everyone was able to remain 6 feet apart during the roundtable discussion that everyone would just exercise a bit of extra precaution. After all, what could it hurt to wear the masks?
Rarely have so many seemingly intelligent leaders opted to abandon reason so publicly for something so deadly as the right to spread a killer germ. 
The revelation over Miller had prompted drama on the runway at Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force Two was delayed from taking off, so six people who had interacted with Miller could deplane. Everyone else stayed aboard and jetted off to Iowa where Covid-19 cases are spiking.
As they traveled in the state, Yahoo News reported that a Department of Homeland Security document revealed that 11 Secret Service agents had also tested positive (CNN has independently confirmed the news). 
As Trump confirmed, Pence had himself been in contact with Miller.
Given the fact that hardly anyone at the White House uses a mask and the close quarters in the old building, it should be assumed that lots of folks got near enough to Miller to risk becoming infected by the virus without knowing it. 
And it was with all of these variables in play that the vice president still decided to meet with executives -- who worked inside Covid-19 hotspots -- and have a staffer tell them that it was OK to remove their masks. 
Prior to his meeting with food execs, Pence met with religious leaders and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has loosened statewide restrictions on religious public gatherings as long as they ""implement reasonable public health measures under the circumstances of each gathering to ensure social distancing...(and) increased hygiene practices...,"" according to a new proclamation in Iowa's public health emergency declaration from Reynolds.
Although the governor did ""strongly encourage"" those who are more susceptible to severe and deadly outcomes of the virus to limit their activities outside of their home, the move still means that religious services, and the contagious interactions that permit, can resume. Imagine what could happen if a young and healthy member of a household that, for example, consists of a grandparent, went to a church service where members were asymptomatic and then brought the virus back home. 
But this possibility seemed not to be at the forefront of Pence's mind, as he spoke with the religious leaders.
It may have been, as Pence said, a ""burden"" for some to attend religious services online. But that he would describe this inconvenience as ""a source of heartache for people across the country"" when American families are losing loved ones to Covid-19 at a rate of more than 1,000 per day is profane. 
The Iowa trip was just another example of the vice president, ever Trump's lackey, being right in step with his boss' tone deafness on the issue. 
Consider last week's public relations stunt that had Pence delivering a few boxes of personal protective equipment -- without wearing a mask -- to a nursing home that had Covid-19 patients. 
More than one million of the citizens Pence serves have received a terrifying positive test result. Thousands more get the bad news every day. 
His own press aide, someone he knows well, is in quarantine. Why, in the face of this overwhelming and immediate danger, would he and the president persist in flaunting unsafe behavior and spreading deadly thinking across the land?
The answer is that pandemic denial has become, like climate change denial, a culture war fetish. Just like the automatic weapons brandished by some of those protesting stay-at-home orders, bare-faced public appearances tell the world that you consider the right to infect others a freedom that must not be abridged. 
One can accept that people who have lost employment and are in desperate financial straits, might be moved to extremes in their desire for a return to the pre-pandemic order. A sensible leader, especially one who might actually capture the attention of these angry people, would offer them reliable facts, send immediate and substantial financial help -- and put on a mask."

 (CNN)Go for a walk, visit any open establishment or public space, and you will note a disconcerting phenomenon: People without masks.
There is a pandemic. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of Covid-19, a disease that spreads in droplets that are expelled by infected humans, including as they talk or cough, and whether they show symptoms or not. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering in public, especially where there is a high degree of community-based transmission (that is, when the source of infection is unknown). I live in California, where nearly 60,000 people have been infected. Across the country 1.2 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, with more than 73,000 lives lost-- and projections for the future (another peak in the fall?) are really grim. 
Meanwhile, hospitals and their staff are pushed to the breaking point caring for the sick, with medical staff working weeks without days off to treat the afflicted, risking their own lives and those of their family. And yet, so many people refuse to take warnings seriously to protect themselves and others by wearing a mask in public. 
It's hard to pinpoint how many of us are clueless and careless -- maybe half of those who go outside? A third? Some other fraction? -- but it's certainly way too many. 
The lack of empathy is jarring. We need a shift. 
We need our leaders -- all of them -- to get the message out loud and clear. If you are away from the closed system of your home, the message should say, you must wear a mask. That means, too, employers mandating that workers of all kinds mask up. Do they want the disease spread to subside; do they want business and the economy to eventually come back -- or don't they?
Masks of any kind are not perfect barriers for contagion. Wearing one doesn't offer full protection and shouldn't be thought of as a foolproof, safe way to interact. But experts report that wearing a mask does help protect against transmission by asymptomatic carriers. And note that data show -- according to, among others, Robert Redfield, President Donald Trump's CDC director -- that likely one in four people infected with Covid-19 are indeed asymptomatic and unaware of their contagion. 
Be prudent, be kind. One can think the government's response to the virus is an overreaction and still wear a mask, just in case you might make someone sick. That's reality.
Wearing a mask is cumbersome. It's hot, and it's uncomfortable. But it can save lives and ease the burden on those doctors and nurses facing unspeakable pain and suffering on the front lines. 
Making personal sacrifices for the public good has not always been an American priority. We are an individualistic culture, and by nature we may find it more difficult to empathize with others when our own freedom and liberties feel like they are on the line. There is resistance to allowing the government or anyone else step in and require -- or even strongly urge -- Americans to cover their faces. 
But surely we can all understand that sometimes regulations are in place to protect people from themselves, or to avoid suffering of the community. We require drivers to wear seat belts to protect the passengers and minimize the potential for serious injury. (Those injuries not only affect the driver, but also the emergency room workers and even taxpayers through disability and unemployment.) 
Laws require children to have vaccines, not only for the child's sake but to maintain herd immunity for all of us. We don't have a vaccine for Covid-19. But we can all help until we do: we DO know about masks.
Back in the early 1990s, I was a social work intern in the HIV/AIDS unit at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. AIDS was still a death sentence, and every worker and visitor took ""universal precautions"" to avoid transmission with all patients. The prevailing wisdom then and now is that when it's impossible to assess by looking if someone could be infected, wear gloves and masks. We protected ourselves. Yes, wearing gloves was uncomfortable. So was getting HIV.
Where are our universal precautions for Covid-19?
Wearing a mask in public is an act of respect for your fellow humans. This is the kind of empathy I try to teach my children. Our kids are watching the adults through this pandemic, and they are learning lots of lessons -- intended and unintended. 
I want my children to understand that being mildly inconvenienced for the greater good is not only right, it's a moral imperative. It's how we manage to live together in relative safety in our society.
It's a no brainer. Wear the damn mask."

 (CNN)For a long time, I have struggled with the realities of what war does to human beings. 
When I covered armed conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Sri Lanka, Gaza and Israel, I always knew I was putting myself in danger. It was a personal choice whether to go or not, and when the decision was made, I pushed the fear and my own frailty to one side and charged in with my intrepid crew members. I knew that if I survived a particularly dangerous assignment, I would leave the battlefield behind. 
Those suffering the bombardments could not. They had to witness their homes, their businesses and their very lives being taken from them. I have never gotten over the incredible guilt of being able to walk away from a place under siege because my assignment was up. 
The images and sounds come back from time to time as the memories swirl and fade and are reborn. The faces of the dead. Children with severed limbs. The wails of mothers. The desperate croaks of fathers trying to subdue their grief. The sigh of someone's last breath. The begging for God. The way the eyes look when the spirit is gone. 
War terrorizes the mind as much as it does the body. With Covid-19, I'm once again doing war coverage -- but of a different sort. 
This is a battle that has come to all of us -- friends, family, neighbors and people I have yet to know. It is unrelenting and invisible. And it is cunning because it isn't happening to everyone all at once, tricking some into thinking it's not their problem. 
It's a war where there are no refugees because there is nowhere in the world you can go to fully escape the possibility of being attacked. The bombs are droplets from a cough or sneeze of another person who isn't intending to hurt you. There is no negotiating with the enemy. 
This is a quiet war. A lonely war. A wait-it-out war. A war of uncertainty. 
There are no deafening sounds of war planes above or teeth-rattling tanks on our streets. There is less noise than anyone can remember in the major cities. Mostly, what you hear is the hopeful sound of birds chirping all day long. The sunshine beckons, making it hard to resist wanting to socialize with everyone you know -- and in person, for goodness' sake. 
Then the occasional ambulance siren blares. Reality sets in. The virus doesn't promise to kill you, but it has killed hundreds of thousands across the world so far. In some of us, it doesn't show itself at all. In others, it debilitates for weeks. And when it does kill, it can mean a lonely death, one surrounded by people whose eyes you do not recognize and who are wearing clothes that appear meant more for a moonscape than this earth. This enemy is cruel that way. 
For millions of Americans, the coronavirus is sucking the life out of their livelihoods. It breeds fear about the future health and wealth of our households, never mind the nation as a whole. The fever many of us are experiencing is of the cabin variety. Cooped up with our own thoughts, worrying about our children's education or our parents, grandparents and friends' underlying conditions. Wondering how this will end, and worrying that our world will never be the same even when the pandemic dies out. It is of great solace to look back and realize we are not the first to have lived through a thing like this. 
But this viral war is ravaging certain communities with deadlier consequences, and it is terrifying how callous we have become when that community is not ours.
That indifference is evidence of the other war that rages alongside the coronavirus. It is an old war and also a disease, one that we as Americans have lived with for centuries without ever completely conquering it: Racism. In 2020 the two wars converged; the coronavirus met racism with all its debilitating tentacles.
A singular incident reignited the old war. We were all supposed to be staying at home in our cocoons to stave off Covid-19, but the snuffing out of George Floyd under a police officer's knee propelled people into the streets. 
The outcry against injustice simultaneously put one of the most vulnerable communities to the virus in a potential Covid petri dish. One sign I saw in the streets of Minneapolis summed up the sentiment: ""F**k the virus. End Racism Now."" 
While many who marched wore masks, I was told by demonstrators over and over again that they were risking their health, and potentially their lives, because marching against police brutality and racism was more important. 
Fighting against that old war took precedence, even in the face of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that Covid-19 hospitalizations for ""non-Hispanic black persons have a rate approximately 5 times that of non-Hispanic White persons."" Health experts will tell you there are a myriad of reasons why the virus is especially vicious to Black Americans, just as there are a myriad of reasons why hatred still permeates our society, striking at Black and Brown people with the same kind of overexaggerated vengeance. 
If you're Black American, you figure that both this new war and the old can take your breath away. It is just a matter of time. 
But they are also keenly aware that one fight has a potential for a vaccine within a certain timeframe. The other has the potential to plague the Black community until the end of time if change isn't worked on with the same fervor."

According to multiple outlets, including ESPN and The Philadelphia Inquirer, Urena had tested positive for Covid-19. The Marlins did not announce any positive tests publicly on Sunday.
The Marlins went on to win the game, 11-6. After the game, in a video call with reporters, Marlins shortstop Miguel Rojas said Sunday that players had decided to play the game following a group chat.
""We made the decision that we're going to continue to do this and we're going to continue to be responsible and just play the game as hard as we can,"" Rojas said.
As of Monday, 11 Marlins players and two coaches tested positive for coronavirus, ESPN reported. The results came in after the team played a three-game series against the Phillies. The team planned to remain in Philadephia as it awaited a new round of test results, Marlins CEO Derek Jeter said Monday.
Three games were postponed as a result of the positive cases. The Marlins' home opener against the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees game at the Philadelphia Phillies, both scheduled for Monday night, have been postponed, MLB said. In an interview on MLB Network, Manfred said the Marlins will not play their game on Tuesday in Miami, either. 
A reporter followed up with Rojas Sunday, asking if in that group chat there was a discussion Sunday morning that maybe they should not play that day.
""That was never the mentality,"" Rojas replied. ""We knew this could happen at some point. We came to the ballpark and were ready to play. It was never a thought that we weren't going to play.""
After the game, Marlins manager Don Mattingly was asked if it had been considered at all on Sunday morning to not play the game because of the situation. The reporter asking the question did not reference positive Covid-19 tests.
""You never really considered not playing from my standpoint,"" Mattingly said. ""We're taking risks every day. Every day we're taking risks so that's what the players all around the league are doing. You know you travel all the time. You know it started with this road trip, you're traveling. You're in planes, you're in buses, you're in different hotels. It's a risk that we take and I just think we have to, I'm going all the back to Michael Hill, who told us early on we're going to have to be adjustable. We're going to have to be flexible. We're going to have to be patient. We're going to have to set ourselves up to have to deal with a lot and different scenarios. So we're getting tested early, hopefully we're not getting tested later. Hopefully, we can pass this test.""
Mattingly, who acknowledged Sunday the team planned to leave Philadelphia on Monday morning instead of Sunday, was asked why not playing was not a consideration.
""You look at scenarios, could we have played it at a different time of the year,"" Mattingly said. ""You know, and our guys make the decision, right? And maybe it was a discussion but the conclusion they came to was that we're taking chances every day. I think it was more about the flight and kinda seeing where we're at before we fly.""

 (CNN)This Sunday, the Covid-19 pandemic, which already has flattened several holiday celebrations -- Mardi Gras, St Patrick's, Passover, Easter, Ramadan -- will run over another. And not just any holiday, but the one that for many, including me, is the most important of them all: Mother's Day. 
Even for ardent social distancing enthusiasts, the urge to gather, to cut a few corners, bend the rules and not the curve, to try to outsmart the current rules of engagement, will be intense. I mean, if the weather is nice, we could sit outdoors six feet apart and wave, right? And the presents, we could put them in a room for three days and... 
But let's be smart and safe about this. To help sort through what's ahead, here are a few tips to help you plan. 
Families that live far away from mothers or grandmothers are the only ones with a simple choice --call or video-chat. 
But what if you typically pack up and head over to see Mom? Or wait for Mom to visit? Or meet in a restaurant? What should you do? 
As difficult as it is, the answer is simple. Don't. 
Travel and uncertainty will make not only the day itself unsettling, but for the two weeks afterward every sneeze, every cough and every ache experienced by anyone will spark panic and regret. The visit is simply not worth the risk -- however small -- of exposing Mom to the virus that causes Covid-19. 
Besides, we were given Zoom, and a two-month lead on how to use it, precisely because we knew Mother's Day was coming, right? OK, the fun wore off quickly and we know what everyone's walls and bookshelves look like, and the discussions of walls and bookshelves already is stale.
Indeed, Zoom and its competitors have become a chore, starting with the fumbling and technical chaos at the start and ending with the realization that no one really knows when or how to leave the call without seeming rude. 
But this is for Mom. And with everyone's mom at the center of the call, the circle of Zoomers will quickly fall in line and resume where they were the last time the family gathered, with grudges, slights, misunderstandings, and -- special new feature -- private chats to complain. Introducing America's first virtual Festivus -- which will be wonderful. 
The busiest day for restaurants is not Christmas or Valentine's Day, but Mother's Day. 
By a long shot. Conviviality, though, relies on proximity, right? How do we make it festive if we are staring at 13-inch screens miles apart?
This one is easy -- order in big meals for Mom and you and your siblings and the entire extended family. Parents love to watch their children and grandchildren eat. I know this both as a former child and a current parent. The joy of watching a loved one pack down a good meal, even on video, is much better than consuming the meal oneself. Plus, food adds easy topics for consideration during the e-chat. 
This is the only truly difficult question. There will a chance to talk to Mom tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Go ahead and creep in this petty pace. She will understand.
But what about an elderly mother or grandmother living alone or in a long-term care facility? America has 1,600 nursing homes caring for 1.3 million residents and about 70% of the residents are women. This is because women live four or five years longer than men in just about every society, creating the imbalance. 
And as has been well-documented in recent weeks, nursing homes, along with prisons and meat-packing factories, currently are the hot spots of Covid-19 transmission. At least 1 in 10 nursing homes have a case (which usually means many more than one case) Recent estimates place the number of nursing home deaths from Covid-19 at 17,000, a number that is sure to rise. 
It unfortunately gets worse: When France began to include nursing home deaths in their tally, the number of fatalities doubled. In New Jersey, the governor announced recently that about half of the fatalities in the entire state were related to nursing homes, a predicament that has now made employees fear becoming ill and has prevented loved ones from being able to visit. And in the US, the enforcement of protective regulations has been loosened, not tightened, despite the tragedy.
When the story of the Covid-19 pandemic finally is written, the ongoing cruel disregard for the elderly will stand out as a shocking example of inhumanity. The federal government has made no concerted attempt to address the problem beyond guidance to sharply restrict visitors and recommend supplies that seldom are available. 
Though facilities generally do not allow visitors, a simple solution to visitor restrictions, such as establishing rapid testing stations at these facilities and supplying everyone with appropriate masks and gloves, has not even been undertaken at scale nationally.
Indeed, testing of residents and staff and reporting the results to the public, particularly to families, has been done haphazardly if at all. 
So for a Mother's Day gift this year, in addition to the scarf or picture frame or home-drawn greeting card, consider making noise. Call someone -- a President, a senator, a governor, a mayor, a hapless Cabinet member, anyone and everyone -- to deliver one loud message: The cruel and unusual punishment of the elderly, who raised us, loved us, and protected us for our entire life, simply cannot continue."

She was determined to be a voice for her patients through silence.
Leander, a Banner Health nurse of five years, joined an intimate group of healthcare workers on Monday to counter protest at the Capitol, where people gathered to urge the governor to reopen the state.
Standing up straight, her arms crossed and face mask on, Leander stood on the Capitol steps, with a handful of healthcare workers lined up by her side. She said she only spoke if someone encroached on her personal space, despite people raising their voices at her.
""It was heated, people were very fired up about what they had to say,"" she said. ""A lot of the top comments we got were about us being fake nurses, there was a huge majority of them that still believe this virus is fake, that it's a hoax and not real at all. They were convinced that we're fake nurses and that's why we weren't talking."" 
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has put a stay-at-home order in place until April 30. Because of this, several different groups of rallied at the Capitol to say the economy has suffered enough and the order needs to be lifted, according to CNN affiliate KNXV.
Leander told CNN she volunteered to work in the hospital's Covid-19 unit full time and has been seeing patients from all over the state for the last month.
""I just hope people see that nurses are not the enemy and we'll take care of them one way or the other,"" Leander said. ""I don't care if you believe in this virus or not or truly what your opinion is of it, if these people show up in my ICU we will take care of them one way or another.""
After seeing photos and video Sunday of people at a rally in Denver, Colorado, demanding the state reopen and ease restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, Leander said she was inspired and wanted to stand up in support of her fellow healthcare workers. 
After seeing a Facebook post about Monday's rally, Leander said she texted a few of her colleagues and headed there.
Leander and the few other nurses, from other hospitals, stood in silence at the ""Patriots' Day Rally"" at the Capitol where nearly 1,000 people gathered, according to KNXV. 
""This isn't about politics, choosing sides, this virus does not discriminate at all,"" she said. ""It's taking lives from one end of the spectrum to another. I know it's wishful thinking but I just would love if we just had that common ground with fighting this virus.""
Leander said right now the public needs to be listening to the experts who are studying this virus. Even as nurses, they're relying on science to guide them. 
""Our main message was that we wanted healthcare workers' voices to be heard louder than misinformation and fear,"" Leander said. ""There will be a calm and controlled manner to reopen our economy and our state...you don't open the flood gates and release everyone at once."" 
Experiencing heartbreaking moments at work
Photos from the rally in Denver caught the attention of many on social media, including former Arizona state Sen. Dr. Kelli Ward, who challenged Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary in 2016.
Ward tweeted Tuesday morning, questioning the authenticity of the healthcare workers who attended and calling the movement propaganda.
""EVEN IF these 'spontaneously' appearing ppl at protests against govt overreach (sporting the same outfits, postures, &amp; facial expressions) ARE involved in healthcare - when they appeared at rallies, they were actors playing parts #Propaganda #FakeOutrage,"" Ward tweeted.
CNN has reached out to Ward for comment.
After hearing about Ward's tweet, Leander said if given the opportunity she would walk her through the ICU at her hospital to the bedside of some of her coronavirus patients to see firsthand the impacts of the virus. 
""I wish she could be in my shoes for a day, I'd have her put on a pair of scrubs and walk with me,"" Leander said. 
Leander has not seen any of her family members since she's been working in the Covid-19 unit. And although that lost time has been tough, what she's been experiencing in the hospital is tougher. 
""A human being having to pass away via FaceTime because their family is not allowed in the hospital during this crisis, it's the most heartbreaking thing you will ever see,"" she said.
A few days ago, Leander said she had a patient grab her hand and say, ""Please tell me I'm not going to die here.""
While Leander knows better days are ahead, she said it doesn't take away from the reality that there are people impacted and suffering right now."

 (CNN)With Covid-19 isolating young people from their peers around the world, many observers worry about a ""lost generation"" emerging. The roster of leading American presidential candidates, dominated by aging baby boomers in 2020, offers little evidence that young voices are coming forward as a viable political force. 
Although there are many reasons to worry about the mental health and social development of young people in the shadow of Covid, we see reasons for optimism in their new burst of coherent political activism, partially facilitated by the pandemic. College students and recent graduates are well situated to organize, connect and build a new consensus on policy reforms. Young Americans, in particular, are showing commitment to a pragmatic center of policy priorities: affordable health care for all, environmental sustainability, international cooperation, civil rights and economic justice. Despite their current isolation, most young Americans embrace empathetic leadership and they are devoted to serving their communities. 
Right now, the conditions are ripe for a youth-led political movement in the United States and other countries, demanding reforms in line with their values. And as societies try to emerge from Covid-19 lockdown conditions, young voices will have an opportunity to grow in influence. Within recent days, according to Pew, millennials overtook baby boomers as America's largest generation, and Gen Z will comprise 10% of the eligible voter electorate for the 2020 US elections. Covid-19 could be the exogenous shock to our socio-political system that will realign the nation's priorities and break the polarization and anger that dominate our political lives.
Many pundits question whether young people in the US will come out to vote, when traditionally their participation numbers have been lower than older cohorts. In recent Democratic primaries their turnout was disappointing, especially for candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who relied on the enthusiasm of young voters. If young people do not vote in larger numbers, their activism -- however lively or inspiring -- has little hope of influencing policy. 
But these pessimistic judgments are also misleading. Youth turnout in recent elections shows a clear pattern of increase through the 2020 primary season. Facebook and other social media platforms are sharing information widely with young voters about why they should vote, and how they can register, despite efforts by some states to suppress their votes. Voting-by-mail will also facilitate youth turnout, as the April 7 elections in Wisconsin illustrated. Most significant, the Covid-19 crisis has provided a shared imperative for young people to elect representatives who will address their common educational, health, and employment needs. Young voters arguably have more motivation than any time since the Vietnam War. 
By helping younger Americans find their voice and show them how to matter, political loyalties can be forged for effective governance. The question now is whether either party can muster the leadership, discipline, and vision to take advantage of this opening and work with this emerging generation. Because of their numbers and their vital role in rebuilding societies after the pandemic, young men and women are perfectly suited to lead the charge forward for several reasons. 
First, young people have a history of igniting political change in times of crisis. The 1960s are the best recent example, when young men and women organized around universities to march for civil rights, withdrawal from war in Vietnam, and reform in communist tyrannies around the world. They held the hypocrisies of their elders up to a bright light and transformed every major society in the years after 1968.
Second, while the hearts and minds of many college students today are open, pragmatic and moderate, they have also long felt ignored. That must change in the Covid era. Research from the American Enterprise Institute consistently shows that most Gen Zers, for instance, feel that they have limited efficacy compared to older generations; more so than older counterparts, Gen Zers tend to feel that holding elections doesn't make the government pay attention to what the people think. In this light, the dearth of excitement for the 2020 election on campuses makes some sense.
However, AEI's research also shows that the often-claimed ideological leftism of 18 to 22 year-old Americans is overstated, and this is the case for those both in and out of college. Many more Gen Zers than stereotype might suggest identify as something other than ""liberal"" -- moderates, conservatives and even those who haven't given politics much thought are well represented. 
These findings make it quite clear that there is no left monoculture among young citizens; significant numbers cluster in the middle, are politically open and fairly disconnected, and are not on the extremes whatsoever. A new consensus is possible, especially around leaders who can reach out and respond to the pragmatic policy values of Gen Zers.
Third, and perhaps most important, technology empowers young citizens to connect and organize more rapidly and inexpensively than before. With current shutdowns of school and business, millennials and Gen Zers have an unusual but opportune moment to use this technology for their purposes. They are focused on connecting with one another and creating new economic and social opportunities.
Take two political races that are very much in the minds of our students. The 2016 victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton for the White House and the 2018 primary win of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez over Joseph Crowley, a 10-term, influential incumbent in New York's 14th Congressional district and former chair of the House Democratic Caucus. In both cases, the victorious candidates relied heavily on social media, authentic grassroots organizing and mobilization and working outside the traditional power bases of their parties. Trump's supporters were older, on average, than Ocasio-Cortez's, but they both exploited new technologies and motivations for political participation.
Campaign spending reflected the Ocasio-Cortez mantra: ""You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game."" In Ocasio-Cortez's case, she was outspent by Crowley 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000). In the case of Clinton and Trump, Secretary Clinton had a poor grassroots ground game and her campaign spent significant sums on negative television advertising.
Politics by other means, emphasizing new technology and new voters, has become the new normal. The traditional tactics of late 20th-century big money -- especially centrally controlled prime time advertising, phone banking, and postal mailings -- are less relevant.
This new campaign context opens crucial space for young voters, who are savvy enough to look beyond Twitter and its extreme echo chamber. Young Americans are quite comfortable connecting on multiple platforms, despite the superficial narratives that they are scared of intimacy and talking on the phone. In fact, younger Americans are the most communicative across an array of media. And, unlike television and print media which are very costly and territorially limited, the technologies used by young citizens are inexpensive and widely accessible. Without question, young Americans are already doing more of the talking and listening.
Steven Olikara has been organizing young people for more than a decade as the founder of the Millennial Action Project in Washington DC. He told us, ""Crises like Covid-19 demand cooperative leadership that inspires hope in our future. Millennial leaders are answering that call, utilizing technology to bring thousands of university courses online, and taking to social media to educate citizens on how to vote safely in a pandemic.""
Olikara recounted how just last week a group of young elected leaders in Iowa came together across party lines to release a series of online videos through social media, aimed at motivating fellow millennials to vote and participate in other ways. It is but one among many examples of young people around the country standing up for our democracy, and reaching out to their peers.
For young men and women, in particular, Covid-19 has laid bare the incompetence and isolation of the Trump administration. Harm and fallout from this pandemic will be felt everywhere in the nation regardless of party. The upcoming election and its aftermath could resemble 1932 -- a realigning shift. Past crises have catalyzed significant political change, and there is strong reason to expect Covid-19 to have a similar transformative effect. This is not a good time to be a Republican incumbent. 
The most important political fact of our times is that our nation's young citizens are at home in larger numbers than ever before in the last century. They are widely connected to one another, and they are looking to make their voices heard. Young Americans have sparked real change before, and they are largely empathetic and open pragmatists. Despite physical distancing restrictions, they have the tools and motivation to connect, organize, and become real agents of change. The youth earthquake is just beginning."

That is, until Covid-19.
Since late March, the White House has been on virtual lockdown. This week, however, party preparation began anew. Tables popped up on the South Lawn, installed by staff who had been cut back from in-person work several weeks earlier out of an abundance of caution, but who have returned this week to set up the White House July Fourth party. 
For White House social secretary Rickie Niceta and the White House team of chefs and butlers, housekeeping staff and ushers, the slow build back to normal begins with a party in the midst of a pandemic. 
The chairs for the tables, however, are not the typical eight or 10, but instead just four -- only enough to accommodate a socially distant seating plan. There will be tablecloths and flowers, some food -- including grill stations for hot dogs and hamburgers (adorned with tiny American flags attached to toothpicks) and nonalcoholic drinks -- details overseen by Niceta, herself one of the staffers who had since late March been doing her job from home. 
Waitstaff, who were typically bare-handed for previous outdoor White House events and white-gloved for more formal ones, will this July Fourth be wearing disposable rubber gloves and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-advised face masks, which will be constantly swapped out for fresh ones, a White House official told CNN.
The guest list for the picnic will reflect the health trauma the country is still grappling with. ""Guests will be made up of front-line workers and their families,"" deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN, ""including law enforcement, doctors, nurses and others, as well as members of the military and their families."" 
Members of the Trump administration will also be in attendance, Deere said. Though Deere did not specify how many guests were expected, the White House says the invitation-only event, which culminates in watching flyovers of military aircraft and a large-scale fireworks show on the National Mall, will include social distancing. 
""As President Trump has said, this year's Independence Day celebration will have a different look than 2019 to ensure the health and safety of those attending,"" Deere said. 
Yet Friday evening, Trump, with first lady Melania Trump, attended a program and fireworks display at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where several thousand were blatantly non-socially distanced, packed closely together in amphitheater-style bleacher seating. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said earlier in the week during an interview that those who didn't want to maintain the CDC guidelines of staying at least 6 feet apart were welcome to attend.
""We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home. But those who want to come and join us, we'll be giving out free face masks, if they choose to wear one. But we won't be social distancing,"" Noem said on Fox News.
Back at the White House on Thursday, boxes of face masks were being unpacked, thousands of them ready to be placed with hand wipes and sanitizer into personal pouches of protection for each guest. Passing out masks and enforcing personal space feels incongruous at the home of a President who, while publicly saying he is ""fine"" with the idea of face masks, has shunned wearing one of his own in front of press. In fact, Trump's anti-mask status has helped turn the decision to wear a mask or not into a political issue.
The Fourth of July wasn't always as politically charged as it is this year, with a country in the middle of a cultural and social reckoning, as well as a pandemic, and an election looming just four months away. Thomas Jefferson in 1801 was the first American President to hold a July Fourth celebration at the White House, complete with horse races on the North Lawn and the Marine Band (who will also play at Saturday evening's party) performing patriotic tunes in the entrance hall, according to the White House Historical Association's research. 
In 1850, though at the still-under-construction Washington Monument and not the White House, President Zachary Taylor attended Fourth of July festivities and consumed ice water and cherries and other raw fruit. Taylor died at the White House five days later from a gastrointestinal illness that historians believe to be cholera. 
Shortly thereafter, in the early 1900s, when the grounds of the White House were virtually open to anyone who wanted to stroll them, the Fourth of July made it a favorite picnic spot, kicking off the tradition of an evening on the sprawling lawn, admiring fireworks that were set off over the National Mall.
A favored photo op for many a president and first lady in more recent decades has been standing on the second-floor Truman Balcony of the White House, a spacious outdoor area commissioned by former President Harry Truman in 1947 that extends from the Executive Residence's Yellow Oval Room, looking into the distance at the fireworks.
Last year, Trump went all out for the Fourth of July, with an expansive and expensive display of patriotic firepower on the Mall. The first couple opted not to sit at the White House for the festivities, but instead watched from the Lincoln Memorial, overlooking a massive crowd who cheered in the rain as displays of military might flew overhead. 
This year, with all that coronavirus continues to rob from Americans, the celebration will likely be under the weather in a different way."

The veteran teacher moved to Des Moines, Iowa, with her young daughters to teach in a new school district -- but this is the first time she's been scared about returning to the classroom.
So, in addition to all her back-to-school preparations this summer, Backstrom wrote her own obituary and sent it to Gov. Kim Reynolds' office.
""It wasn't something at all that I took lightly. It was something that I really hoped that my governor would read and hear that if something were to happen to me, that this is who is no longer here,"" she told CNN. ""I'm hoping that she will start to realize that these are real people, and these are real lives.""
In her obituary, which she provided to CNN, she wrote, ""Sarah loved her friends and family with her whole heart. She had a laugh that was infectious and could always be counted on for an off-hand remark or a joke. She was known for finding sunshine even in the darkest of times.""
Backstrom, 43, said that she was known for her ""rainbow hair and eccentric fashion sense,"" and urged her friends and loved ones to wear leopard prints or a funny T-shirts and rainbow wigs to celebrate her life.
She will be teaching gifted students at three elementary schools, and recently found out that her work will be 100% virtual to minimize the risk of her tracking the coronavirus from building to building.
Backstrom said she loves being in the classroom and is sad that she won't be able to greet her students with hugs and enjoy the back-to-school rituals that are so important to children.
""There's really nothing that can take the place of face-to-face talking with a student,"" she said. ""There's something really magical that happens in a classroom when you're all in this space and kind of sharing energy.""
She and her ex-husband also have two daughters going into preschool and fifth grade, so she knows firsthand how tough home schooling is on parents.
""More than anything, I want to be in the classroom, and I want to be in my schools, but I also don't want to get sick and I don't want my mom to get sick,"" she said.
Gov. Reynolds released guidance July 30 that said at least half of schools' instruction must be conducted in person and that schools couldn't request online-only education unless their county's positivity rate is 15% or higher.
Iowa has reported 46,656 cases across the state and a 9.4% positivity rate as of Tuesday, according to the Iowa Department of Health.
On Tuesday, Gov. Reynolds said that school districts that hold online-only instruction without authorization would be defying state law and that those days would not be counted as instructional days.
""Children need to be in a classroom,"" she said in the news conference.
Gov. Reynolds told reporters that she appreciates educators' concerns, and that the state is doing everything it can to keep everyone safe.
""I have grandchildren that are going back to school. I would never do anything that would put them in harm's way intentionally. I don't think any of us would,"" she said, adding that her daughter, who's expecting, is a teacher in the state.
President Trump has also called for schools to reopen in the fall, but many of the country's largest districts are planning for remote learning.
Backstrom said she was inspired to write after reading an article about Sioux City teacher Jeremy Dumkrieger, who published his own obituary in the Iowa Starting Line website.
In it, he joked about his wife's cold feet and wrote that ""his only regret in life was not meeting her sooner, frozen feet and all."" He also expressed his love for their children and their dachshund Steve.
More seriously, he wrote that because of Covid-19 ""he died alone, isolated from the family who meant the world to him.""
Dumkrieger, 43, said he decided to write the obituary because he's concerned about being in a classroom full of kids -- especially since the state does not require people to wear masks. Iowa did launch an initiative last month to encourage people to wear masks.
He said putting his feelings for his wife and kids on paper was more emotional than he expected, and he got a little choked up talking about it.
""It took me a couple days to write it,"" he said. ""It was tough, and I know a lot of teachers that told me that they started writing, but then stopped because they just couldn't get through it.""
Dumkrieger said he has heard from some people who were offended by his mock obituary, but said they'll be even more upset when they start seeing real ones for teachers who actually die. 
He feels that a mask mandate would reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the community and make it easier for schools to protect their students, teachers and staff.
Dumkrieger said he considered looking for a different job, but said teaching is what he loves and it's how he serves his country.
""I'm going to go back and teach. I'm going to wear a mask and make sure I'm keeping everybody safe,"" he said.

But with the Covid-19 pandemic, more of the fall football season is getting wiped out -- and possibly will be moved to the spring.
Eight of the 13 NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) conferences have now announced that they aren't playing conference football this fall -- meaning the annual FCS playoffs to determine a national champion will not be held this fall.
The FCS is formerly known as Division I-AA and is separate from the NCAA's top tier, NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which uses the College Football Playoff.
The Big Sky Conference announced Friday that it is postponing its fall 2020 football season to spring 2021. Additionally, the Pioneer Football League announced Friday there would be no conference competition in the fall. The others that previously have announced they won't have football conference play in the fall are the Colonial Athletic Association, the Ivy League, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, the Northeast Conference, the Patriot League and the Southwestern Athletic Conference.
Per the NCAA Board of Governors guidelines announced Wednesday, if 50% or more of eligible teams in a particular sport in a division cancel or postpone their fall season, there will be no NCAA fall championship in that sport.
North Dakota State, which is part of the Missouri Valley Conference, has the most FCS championships, winning eight of the last nine titles, including in 2019.
The Big Sky said in a press release that it has begun exploring modified versions of a conference football schedule to be played in the spring and fully supports the NCAA shifting the FCS playoffs to the spring.
""This is the right decision for our member institutions, even though we realize how disappointing it will be for all who represent and care about Big Sky football,"" Big Sky commissioner Tom Wistrcill said. ""We will now shift our attention to doing everything within our power to provide our football student-athletes and coaches with a conference schedule and a championship opportunity in the spring. We already have begun actively engaging our fellow FCS conferences and the NCAA to join us then for what will be a unique opportunity to return to competition and compete for an FCS championship.""
According to the NCAA Board of Governors guidelines, if any NCAA division elects to postpone fall sports championships, the decision to conduct the championships at later dates must be based on the scientific data available at that time, as well as an assessment of the operational, logistical and financial impact of proceeding. 
When a championship is set to occur on a new date, an additional assessment must be made using the same factors (scientific data available at the time and operational, logistical and financial impact), and the division will report its determinations to the Board of Governors for its review.
On Wednesday, it was announced in separate NCAA press releases that the Division II's seven fall 2020 championships were canceled, and Division III was canceling fall sports championships for 2020-2021."

In some states, much of those gains have been erased after an abysmal July that shattered records for new cases, hospitalizations or deaths.
""I want to be very clear: What we are seeing today is different from March and April,"" Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus task force coordinator, told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday.
""It is extraordinarily widespread. This epidemic right now is different ... and it's both rural and urban."" 
In the past month, the US has seen: 
-- The highest number of new Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began.
-- Test positivity rates increasing in 32 states.
-- Record-high hospitalizations or deaths in several states.
-- 10 days with more than 1,000 new Covid-19 deaths.
Now the race is on to try to rein in Covid-19 before more classrooms reopen -- and before more states might have to shut down again. 
Almost 2 million new cases in 1 month
July saw the biggest number of new cases of any month since the pandemic began, with more than 1.9 million new cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
And that's not just due to testing.
While the number of tests performed has increased, the test positivity rate has also increased. That means a larger percentage of tests performed turn out to be positive.
Had the rise in new case numbers just been the result of increased testing, ""the percent positive line could look flat or like it is decreasing over the time period when cases increased,"" according to Johns Hopkins University. 
But that's not what's happening. As of Sunday, 32 states had higher test positivity rates over the past week compared to the previous week -- suggesting ""increased transmission,"" Johns Hopkins said on its Coronavirus Resource Center website.
""If we see the percentage of positive tests begin to rise, it indicates insufficient testing to find infections that may be occurring,"" Johns Hopkins said. ""Not finding these infections may mean that the virus is transmitting without intervention, which can lead to future case growth.""
Record hospitalizations and deaths
While some states' numbers are starting to improve, several states have recently endured their highest numbers of Covid-19 hospitalizations or deaths -- two metrics that can't be attributed to increased testing. 
-- Florida broke its daily record for new Covid-19 deaths every day for four days in a row. On Friday, the state reported 257 additional deaths, surpassing its previous record of 253 deaths on Thursday.
-- Last Wednesday, California reported 197 deaths, its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day. That shattered California's previous grim record of 159, set just a week earlier.
-- Last Tuesday, North Carolina reported a record number of 1,244 Covid-19 hospitalizations.
-- Texas broke its hospitalization record twice in two days. On July 21, the Lone Star State had 10,848 Covid-19 patients. The next day, the number jumped to 10,893 hospitalized patients. 
-- Texas also reported 197 deaths on July 23, the highest daily death toll since the beginning of the pandemic. 
-- Arizona reported 147 deaths on July 18, its highest daily number of Covid-19 deaths.
-- Tennessee reported 37 deaths on July 23, its highest number of deaths in a single day.
Why are these resurgences happening? 
Some medical experts say states reopened too early, far short of meeting national guidelines on reopening. 
Others point to a lack of personal responsibility by many Americans -- such as failing to wear a mask or ignoring social distancing after states reopened.
""There are three or four kinds of epidemics"" that are fueling the spread, said William Haseltine, chairman and president of ACCESS Health International. They include:
-- Young people who are socializing and ignoring physical distancing.
-- Essential workers who are in frequent contact with members of the public.
-- People who live in crowded living conditions.
-- People in nursing homes or correctional facilities where the virus can easily spread.
""But there's another one which I am very worried about, which is our schools,"" Haseltine said. 
""The latest data just shows that children under five have 10 to 100 times as much virus in their nose"" compared to older children and adults. 
Yes. Some states have decreasing rates of infection, hospitalizations and deaths -- paving the way for full economic reopenings.
The most successful states mandated face masks early, started reopening later than others and found innovative solutions to fight the virus.
And while the US still struggles with testing shortages and delays -- making it difficult to isolate those infected -- many of the steps needed to quash Covid-19 are actually pretty easy. 
The two most important steps are social distancing and wearing a face mask when you might come in contact with others, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
""It's not rocket science,"" he told CNN in late July. ""If we all did (both) uniformly, I believe that we could turn things around.""

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
 (The Conversation)With the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic getting worse in most of the country, a growing number of school districts from San Francisco to Atlanta have determined that a return to daily in-person instruction isn't yet safe or viable. They aim to to stick with remote learning as the school year gets underway.
Based on my research about the psychological effects of digital technology, I've seen that when children and teens spend a great deal of time isolated at home and gazing at screens their social skills and self-esteem can suffer and they may become lonelier. Fortunately, there are ways to lower those risks while young people spend way more time than usual at home.
1. Practice paying attention to other people
One important social skill is the ability to pay attention to another person while you're interacting with them. A long-term study of more than 300 teenagers found that those with the heaviest screen use were also the most likely to focus on their own needs, instead of those of the other people they were interacting with. Other research indicates that this self-centered behavior tends to lead to more social problems with friends.
The good news is that regular, daily activities apart from technology can help kids focus in general and pay attention to other people. For example, when families do things together, such as cooking meals and gardening, or have a designated time when everyone reads at the same time, it can help children maintain the social skill of paying attention to others. A large study found that both adults and children engaged in these kinds of activities felt better about their relationships.
Kids find it easier to focus on their friends when they play together in person -- something that is harder to do while social distancing. And when children play outdoors, or even just spend time outdoors, they become more able to pay attention to their friends and, later on, focus on schoolwork. In addition, yoga and other relaxation exercises, such as breathing exercises, can help children practice focusing in general.
2. Foster the give-and-take of conversation
Interactions at school help children learn to read facial expressions and body language, the give-and-take of conversations and how to change or initiate topics of conversation. Having these informal encounters regularly are one way that kids learn how to meet and greet people. While there's no perfect substitute online, there are steps parents and other guardians can take to help preserve a child's social skills.
Some online activities can help kids practice perceiving others' emotions by looking at their faces. One example is the ""Eyes In the Mind Test,"" in which people look at a picture of someone's eyes and guesses the emotion that person is experiencing.
Family time can potentially make the biggest contribution to conversational and social skills. Plan to eat dinner together, without the distraction of any screens or phones because kids who eat dinner with their families tend to form stronger relationships with their peers, marked by less fighting and bullying.
Writing letters by hand, instead of relying on electronic devices for written communication are helpful, too. Parents can encourage kids to find new friends in faraway places through ""snail mail,"" by taking advantage of a pen pal website. Exchanging letters with a stranger builds conversational skills, since writing a letter to get to know someone involves posing questions such as asking about favorite activities and foods.
Parents of homebound kids may need to look for creative ways to keep school friendships going. Apps like Skype, Zoom and FaceTime can be useful but children -- like adults -- can grow tired of them. Fortunately, there are alternatives.
Remind your kids about the difference between brief messages or posts and longer communications. Through my research, I've found that children generally see the differences between brief but fun interactions versus feeling a deep connection to a good friend. Encourage kids to write longer, but less frequent, messages to their friends because it may help keep those relationships strong.
Despite having to socially distance, don't forget that children of all ages can also connect with others outdoors, which is safer than being together indoors. Set up outdoor visits that keep children and teens and their friends 6 feet apart from each other and make sure everyone wears masks. Consider playing croquet or other games that can work with these circumstances or just having them run through sprinklers. Even just a small group of friends hanging out while social distancing can preserve friendships.
Last but not least, encourage teachers to break classes into small groups while they're learning online. Kids can still learn how to study together, practice skills together and talk and socialize while they learn outside the classroom.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The PGA Tour's CJ Cup has been switched to Las Vegas from South Korea because of travel restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tour said in a statement here on Tuesday. 
The $9.75 million tournament, which has been staged at Nine Bridges on Jeju Island for the past three years, will now be held at the Shadow Creek course in Las Vegas from Oct. 15-18. 
South Korea has been one of the biggest success stories in reining in the coronavirus but recent rises have seen the total number of cases rise to more than 17,900, prompting the country to tighten curbs. 
The United States has by far the world’s highest number of infections at more than 5.75 million. Nevada, home to Las Vegas, alone accounts for more than 65,000 cases, according to a Reuters tally. 
“While our players have always looked forward to visiting Korea, the current circumstances provided this new opportunity to bring the event to Las Vegas,” PGA Tour executive vice-president, international Ty Votaw said. 
Justin Thomas sealed a playoff win over Marc Leishman in the inaugural event and prevailed again last year. Brooks Koepka won by four shots in 2018. 
The CJ Cup is part of the PGA Tour’s three-event Asian swing which also includes the Zozo Championship in Japan and the WGC-HSBC Champions in China. (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford and Nick Macfie )"

In an effort to ensure the credibility of health and safety information in its App Store, Apple is tightening requirements for all coronavirus-focused apps, TechCrunch reports. The company posted a note on its developer blog Saturday that outlines the review process for apps related to the virus. 
Were evaluating apps critically to ensure data sources are reputable and that developers presenting these apps are from recognized entities such as government organizations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions, the post states. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19.
Apple also is banning entertainment apps and games that are COVID-19 or coronavirus-themed, the post states.
Developers should choose the time-sensitive event option when submitting a permissible COVID-19 related app to the App Store to expedite the process, since many are focused on alleviating crisis situations. Membership fees for non-profit organizations and government agencies developing apps related to the pandemic will be waived, according to the post.

PARIS, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Ligue 1’s opening match of the new season has been postponed from Friday night after Olympique de Marseille said they had confirmed four cases of COVID-19, French professional soccer’s governing body the LFP said on Tuesday. 
“In view of medical results passed on by Olympique Marseille (...) the LFP has decided to postpone the Olympique de Marseille/AS Saint-Etienne game to Sept 16 or Sept 17”, the LFP said in statement. 
The game was the only fixture set for Friday, with the rest of Ligue 1’s first round of 2020/21 matches spread out over Saturday and Sunday. 
The LFP told clubs last week it had set up a “COVID committee” to advise on whether to postpone matches. When a club reports more than three coronavirus cases postponement is likely, based on the “COVID protocol” the LFP sent out to the clubs. 
Among the “Big Five” European soccer nations, France was the only one to end its season prematurely due to the pandemic. Paris St Germain were awarded the Ligue 1 title. 
The Parisian club and Olympique Lyonnais have reached the semi-finals of the reformatted Champions League, the first time that two French teams will compete at that level. Olympique Marseille is France’s only winner of the biggest prize in European football. 
Almost 40 players from 11 Ligue 1 clubs out of 20 have tested positive for COVID-19, including some at Saint-Etienne. 
Spain’s Mediapro, which holds the rights to air top Ligue 1 matches for the 2020/2021 to 2023/2024 seasons, agreed in early June with TF1, France’s biggest private TV operator, to form a new channel to air top Ligue 1 league matches in the country.

12,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Timothy Aeppel,Work-from-home boom is a bust for big office furniture makers - Reuters India,America's biggest office furniture manufacturers got the rug pulled out from under them by the COVID-19 pandemic.,https://in.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-office-furniture-anal-idINKCN25E1F7,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200818&t=2&i=1530045826&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7H0T7,2020-08-18T11:26:00Z,"(Reuters) - America’s biggest office furniture manufacturers got the rug pulled out from under them by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For decades, producers like Herman Miller Inc (MLHR.O) and Steelcase Inc (SCS.N) focused on selling through their own dealers to companies that bought ergonomic chairs and desks by the truckload and employed teams of designers and technicians to deliver and install them. None of them were prepared for a flood of orders for a single adjustable desk from stay-at-home workers suddenly trying to figure out how to conduct Zoom meetings from spare bedrooms. 
Early in the pandemic in late April, 52% of employed Americans said they were always working from home to avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus, while another 18% reported sometimes working from home, according to a survey by Gallup. A later survey found half said they’d like to continue doing this permanentlyincluding 27% who cited both a preference for remote work and fear of the coronavirus. 
When Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google told employees in May the company would reimburse up to $1,000 to outfit home offices, most of the options they found were inexpensive imports sold by big box stores or Amazon. 
“A Tsunami hit this industry with this pandemic,” said Ron Wiener, chief executive of iMovR, a maker of adjustable desks in Seattle. “The big companies simply weren’t structured to serve people from home.” 
Steelcase, the largest U.S. office furniture maker, and Herman Miller, the No. 2 producer, both reported steep losses and double-digit sales declines in the three months ending in May. For Steelcase, sales of about $483 million were the lowest since its initial public offering in 1998. 
Investors have figured out just how dire their situations have become as some experts predict the virus will largely kill off large offices as more companies find they can operate with workers dispersed, saving on costly real estate. 
Even as the wider stock market has nearly recovered all of its losses from the early days of the outbreak, shares of Steelcase and Herman Miller remain deep in the red. Steelcase shares fell 69% from their 52-week high after the pandemic hit - and are still off 51%. Shares of Herman Miller fell over 71% and are still down over 50%. 
Herman Miller and others say they’ve made strides in expanding their online options since the pandemic hit and have found other ways to sell to individuals. 
Lori Gee, vice president of workplace performance services at the Zeeland, Michigan-based company, said they quickly set up a way for Google employees to buy directly from the company, for instance. 
“Part of this has been an acceleration of what we were already doing - to make it easier to get the best set up,” regardless of where the furniture would go or the size of the order. 
HIGH PRICES, LOGISTICS CHALLENGES 
Manufacturers of many other goods have pivoted to new products, including things needed to fight the pandemic, or stepped up services to make up for other lost business. 
Office furniture makers have had a harder time, in large part because of logistical challenges. The average work-at-home customer, for instance, wants a product that can be sent by a delivery service in a single box and can be easily assembled - ideally without needing special tools. 
Price is also a factor. An Aeron chair, a classic design sold by Herman Miller, comes in versions that can easily cost $1,000. Workstations in offices can cost even more, depending on their complexity and added features, such as adjustable desktops and built-in arms to hold computer monitors. Workers stuck at home are far less likely to splurge on such expensive options, at least in part because many are worried about keeping their jobs. 
The way big companies make their products is a complicating factor. Many producers have outsourced component production, buying bases from one company, for instance, desktops from another, and assembling them into configurations according to the design laid out for a large operation. 
“We’re not used to dealing with the end user - if we get a call from a customer about a missing screw, we’re not set up to handle that,” said Soren Stig-Nielsen, president of LINAK U.S. Inc., the U.S. division of a Danish company that makes many of the world’s actuators for lifting bases on desks to adjust height. The company has a large factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and sells its equipment to most of the big domestic furniture companies, including Steelcase. 
“COVID has created huge demand in the home office area,” said Stig-Nielsen, “and traditionally we have not been a big player in that market.” 
Meanwhile, the industry is not giving up on actual offices. 
Herman Miller’s Gee said it is unclear how long the slump in building new centralized offices will continue. But she said the company’s designers are already working on concepts for a new style of working, including more “small, satellite offices” that they believe companies will want to set up to serve workers more widely dispersed than in the past. 
“We think there will always be the need for a physical workplace - places where you go for collaboration and bring to life the corporate culture,” Gee said.

The man who said he knew more about ISIS than the generals and claimed to have stunned dumfounded aides with his scientific acuity prides himself on a mystical instinct to make right calls. 
Yet Trump's leadership in the worst domestic crisis since World War II has consistently featured wrong, ill-informed and dangerous decisions, omissions and politically fueled pivots.
""Many very good experts, very good people too, said this would never affect the United States,"" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday. ""The experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong and a lot of people didn't know it would be this serious."" 
Such comments are typical of Trump's consistent habit of blaming others for his own poor judgments. For the record, senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official Nancy Messonnier warned on February 27 that it was inevitable the disease would reach the US and could be ""bad."" 
The President's deflections on Tuesday are typical of his wider political method of evading responsibility by bending the truth and of creating distractions. They play into what is apparently his most pressing concern -- massaging his own reputation. Such tactics helped him ride out the Russia scandal and impeachment.
But in the depths of the current disorientating times, the deeper liabilities of the President's political approach are being exposed. A hostility to details, a resistance to accepting the advice of experts and for learning the messy intricacies of a crisis that interrupted his own narrative in election year. Bolstering such an impression, the Washington Post reported for instance that multiple references to the threat from the novel coronavirus were embedded into Trump's classified briefings. Either he didn't read them or he chose to ignore them.
Trump's initial failure was to downplay the seriousness of the crisis. But his management of the situation ever since then has raised questions about the extent to which the President has appreciated the multi-front challenge facing the United States and the world.
Humanity is facing three crises at the very least -- medical, economic and social -- that will cause financial and geopolitical reverberations for years. Yet Trump says he sees ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and acts as if America is nearly home free.
Doubts about the seriousness of the administration's response were also revealed in a more trivial, yet still telling, episode on Tuesday when Vice President Mike Pence flouted CDC guidance and chose not to wear a facemask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Pence explained that he is frequently tested for Covid-19 so was unlikely to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
But he missed a chance to set an example to the rest of the country.
Trump's comments contradict his own experts
Trump's comments on injecting disinfectant last week were ridiculed. But they were a sign of something more than the usual Trumpian storm. They were remarks of a President who often appears unprepared, riffs on intricate issues and hasn't done the homework to master details of a complicated emergency. 
Similarly, Trump urged governors on Monday to seriously consider reopening schools, CNN reported. But he didn't appear to have considered implications of millions of kids gathering, spreading the virus and infecting older, more vulnerable family members in a manner that could fuel the pandemic. His comment was consistent with an apparent conclusion that the worst of the pandemic has passed and that the virus, which scientists say is lying in wait for reopening, is simply gone. 
Even if the looming clutch of state openings do not cause a second spike in the virus, public health experts fear that in the absence of a vaccine it will return with a vengeance later in the year. Not Trump.
""I think what happens is it's going to go away. This is going to go away. And whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we'll be able to handle it,"" he said in remarks that may again amount to underestimating a potential threat.
One of Trump's top medical experts, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been far less enthusiastic than Trump about the lackluster US testing effort appears far less optimistic.
""If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well. If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter,"" Fauci said on Tuesday during an Economic Club of Washington webinar. 
The President is again pushing aggressively for states to get back to business quickly -- despite balking at Georgia's aggressive plan last week. 
""Many States moving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday, showing little appreciation of the huge gamble with health and lives governors are taking without the safety net of a blanket testing program Trump has declined to provide.
The terrible choice facing political leaders 
A wrenching national conversation is needed, ideally led by the President, about the relative impact of the pandemic and the job destroying lockdowns ordered to stop its spread. Political leaders must consider what level of infection and ultimately death is acceptable in a modern society in order to protect basic levels of economic viability. These are crushingly difficult issues that no official expected to face when they ran for office.
But there is no sign that Trump is about to engage on that issue with the public whose confidence will be needed to make any economic rebound sustainable. Every world and local leader is facing these agonizing choices. But given US power, influence and historic leadership of the Western world, a special burden of responsibility is often seen to rest on the shoulders of the man in the Oval Office.
Any normal President who made a prediction that a miracle would sweep a pandemic away, only to see it infect a million Americans over a couple of months, would be politically shattered. President George W. Bush's failures over Hurricane Katrina look trivial by comparison. Yet Trump is protected in his bubble of unknowingness by a conservative media machine that attacks anyone who contradicts his comments. 
The administration's questionable commitment to addressing the nuts and bolts of the emergency have been evident in its repeated promises and failures to scale up the kind of massive testing effort that could help pry open the economy without the risk of a major resurgence. 
Trump appears to have convinced himself that the lack of tests that his own experts and governors say are needed to trace and isolate new infections to stop a resurgence are mere distractions.
""There are big believers in testing, and then there are some governors that don't feel as strongly about it at all,"" Trump, said Monday. 
Such comments make it seem unlikely the President has read the multiple think tank studies or expert opinions that millions of tests per day are needed to beat the pandemic or is interested in guidance that contradicts his pre-cooked view of the pandemic being close to its end. 
Trump prefers to boast about the true fact that the US has tested more people than any other nation. But his sincerity is undermined by the reality that other smaller countries have tested far more people per capita. The US has tested 16.4 tests per 1,000 people, according to the a new Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development report, below the OECD member average of 23.1 tests per 1,000 people and trails Spain and Italy. America does, however, lead the UK and France.
The President's forecasts for the economy also don't seem to appreciate the depth of the slide. His predictions of ""spectacular"" growth in the next few quarters and an economy that will take off like a ""rocket"" sit uneasily with warnings by a top adviser, Kevin Hassett, that the country could be heading for Great Depression levels of unemployment.
There is also debate about the President's observance of another aspect of his role as head of state -- his willingness to console the country at a time of mourning. Trump usually mentions those who died and says they will not be forgotten during his scripted remarks at the start of press conferences. But he most often talks about the dead in terms of what he says are lower than projected final death toll models after the pandemic. And he has taken to arguing that his efforts -- which were belated -- might have saved a million lives. 
There are no guarantees another president of either party would have done a better job in this time of testing than the unconventional Trump.
But it's almost certain that he or she would have made a far greater show of mastering the details and would -- even for their own political protection if nothing else -- have done far more to prepare the country for the trial ahead."

Dr. Rick Bright had led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has been central to the response to the coronavirus outbreak, since 2016. But his departure Tuesday, he believes, stems in part from his resistance to efforts to widen the availability of a coronavirus treatment pushed by President Donald Trump. Bright will now lead a public-private partnership on vaccine development and treatment, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN. 
As BARDA's director, Bright oversaw ""the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures against an array of threats to national security and the public's health, including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear threats and pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases,"" according to an archived webpage of his official biography. 
Bright said in a statement issued Wednesday that he believes his transfer was owed to his ""insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit."" He also announced he will file a whistleblower complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general.
While testifying before Congress in 2018 on BARDA's fight against the flu, Bright had touted the effectiveness of his former agency, saying, ""No one can rival BARDA's success in expanding capacity and pushing new products to the marketplace."" 
Prior to serving as director of the agency, Bright, who had been with BARDA since 2010, served as the director of its Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division, ""where he was responsible for preparing the nation for influenza pandemics,"" according to the World Health Organization. 
But Bright, who holds a Ph.D. in immunology and virology from Emory University, has shared his expertise beyond the US, serving as an adviser to the World Health Organization, according to its website, which said he has also advised the US Department of Defense.
The doctor began his career with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to his biography, where he focused on influenza viruses and antiviral drugs, among other things.
Bright has also held a number of stints in the private sector where he worked on vaccine developments, according to the WHO, and is the recipient of the prestigious Charles C. Shepard Science Award for Scientific Excellence."

She's a vocal Joe Biden supporter -- and one of a growing number of people globally who say they wouldn't take a coronavirus vaccine even if one becomes available soon.
""I'm not anti-vaccine. My kids were both vaccinated with everything, but I would not take a Covid vaccine today,"" Bailey told CNN. 
""I have underlying health issues ... I would want to see enough studies in a long-term period of what the ramifications are for the vaccine.""
Bailey said she doesn't trust US President Donald Trump, and that consensus around a vaccine among the world's top scientists and at least six months of testing would be just ""a start"" in persuading her to take it. ""It's much too soon for me, I'd have to say, 18 months.""
Her trepidation is echoed by a significant proportion of adults all over the world, who reject the extreme views of the anti-vaccine community, but say they have major concerns about a coronavirus jab. 
Neil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University who is studying vaccine skepticism on social media, told CNN the four most common objections are: safety; whether a vaccine is needed; trust of the establishment and pharmaceutical companies; and perceived uncertainty in the science. 
To see how widespread hesitancy is, he suggests asking your family and friends whether they would take a Covid-19 vaccine if one were available now.
""I would be surprised if you ask 10 people and you get all 10 jumping and saying yes without adding any caveats,"" he said.
Doubts over Covid-19 vaccine
Scientists say vaccines are our most effective tool in combating infectious diseases, preventing 6 million deaths every year. Numerous studies have proven that they are safe. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, said that widespread uptake of a coronavirus vaccine could end the pandemic and a study in The Lancet medical journal found that it was the only way to fully end lockdowns.
Yet an Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs online poll from May indicated half of Americans would hesitate to take or refuse a vaccine, and a study by King's College London last week found similar results in the UK.
The polling varies. A CNN poll from May found two-thirds of Americans would personally try to get a vaccine if one were widely available at a low cost. Preliminary results of a 19-country survey by campaign group Convince (Covid-19 New Vaccine Information, Communication and Education) show that about 70% of British and US respondents would take one, according to Scott Ratzan, co-leader of Convince and Distinguished Lecturer at City University of New York School of Public Health.
Yet the ultimate goal of vaccines is to create herd immunity, meaning that enough of the population is immune to make the spread of infection rare. A vaccine could be 70% to 75% effective, Fauci said in June, but if only two-thirds of the population were vaccinated, it is ""unlikely"" that herd immunity would be achieved.
A study published by the University of Hamburg in June found that 71-74% of people in Europe and the US would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity -- observing that ""current willingness levels in France, Germany and the Netherlands, in particular, may prove insufficient to reach this threshold."" 
Johnson said this was a ""massive issue"" -- and possibly an even bigger one than the polls indicate. 
""What the question probably should have said is, will you have the Covid vaccine, will you be first to have it? And of course, I think that the answer for that will be no, I'll wait 'til everyone else has had it. 
""There's always doubt among the anti-vax[xers], but there's now a sufficient doubt among this undecided population.
""I'm very, very concerned, I don't think public health has had this challenge [before] ... because there haven't been social media and these kinds of online influences.""
Global spread of vaccine hesitancy
While vaccine skepticism has historically been an issue in Europe and the US, there are signs of doubts spreading. In Brazil -- where British, Chinese and US firms are conducting trials -- a small fringe of dissenters railed on social media against the ""China vaccine."" Protests also took place against trials in South Africa, Reuters reported.
Johnson told CNN that in Africa, misinformation is spreading about the program being used as a cover to sterilize swathes of the population. ""The fear about that is actually huge in developing countries now,"" he said.
Opinions are shifting across the globe. A 2018 survey by the Wellcome Global Monitor found that 95% of people in South Asia believe vaccines to be safe, higher than any other region. But there have been recent controversies. In the Philippines, a measles outbreak last year was linked to a sharp decline in vaccination uptake after the 2017 suspension of a dengue vaccine program when it was found that it could have had potential adverse effects.
An April report in The Lancet said that Japan's 2013 decision to stop recommending the HPV vaccine could result in almost 11,000 preventable deaths from cervical cancer. The World Health Organization said in 2017 that ""unsubstantiated allegations"" about the vaccine were affecting coverage in several countries and could ""result in real harm.""
In a 2016 survey by the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, just 3% of Indonesians thoughts vaccines were unsafe. But a regional survey in January showed 15% of parents would be reluctant to take a Zika vaccine. Research led by Auliya Suwantika, a pharmacology professor at Padjadjaran University, found that national immunization coverage had declined in recent years, with just 58% of children fully vaccinated, well below the government's 93% target. 
The Covid-19 pandemic has seen a reduction in vaccinations worldwide, largely attributed to school closures and fears of visiting clinics, but the researchers said ""vaccine hesitancy may present a next obstacle."" 
Countering the objections
Several polls and surveys, including a US Reuters/IPOS poll in May, found that the speed of development was the biggest concern with the coronavirus vaccine. Most vaccines take 10 to 15 years to develop. 
""There's clearly cause for concern; the emphasis on speed, on rushing a new vaccine,"" Jeremy Ward, who published a study on vaccine hesitancy with French research consortium Coconel in The Lancet in May, told CNN.
France saw a surge in vaccine skepticism in 2009, with only 8% uptake during the swine flu epidemic. The top concern was speed, despite the fact there was existing knowledge around flu vaccines, said Ward. In May -- when France was in lockdown and its outbreak escalating -- Coconel found that around a quarter of the population would still refuse to take a vaccine.
""I think the main factor is trust in institutions,"" said Ward. He said coronavirus debates in France had become highly politicized. Coconel's study found that those who had voted for a far-left or far-right candidate, or didn't vote at all, were much more likely to say that they would refuse a vaccine.
Russia this week rubber-stamped its Sputnik V vaccine -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite -- before it had even started a Phase 3 trial, in which a vaccine is tested on thousands of people. China also skipped Phase 3, approving an experimental vaccine for military use in June.
Ratzan told CNN the skepticism was ""not helped at all by the 'warp speed' proclamations by President Trump or now the Sputnik 'Space Race' vaccine.""
His research suggests that Russia could have more vaccine refusers than any other country. 
The US Food and Drug Administration said this week that it will not cut corners in vaccine development, and France's health minister said the country would not approve one that has not passed Phase 3 trials. The UK government told CNN that its trials follow a predefined pathway with high standards, and the speed was down to extra investment and support.
With some vaccines, development has been sped up by combining stages. Some have been safety tested on animals and humans in parallel and others undergone simultaneous Phase 1/2 trials, meaning they're tested for the first time on hundreds of people instead of smaller groups.
Mistrust often stems from misinformation disseminated by anti-vaxxers -- or even Russia, according to the US State Department and the European Union. This filters out through all kinds of communities, from wellness to parenting to political groups. 
Ratzan said the issue isn't just the inaccurate information, it's the growing lack of trust in institutions. ""I think we're starting to see these two factors really wear down the public psyche and vaccine acceptance along with it, which is a huge concern,"" he said.
An earlier CUNY School of Public Health Covid-19 study found that just 42% of likely vaccine refusers in New York would be swayed by approval from the FDA or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Several surveys and reports found hesitancy among Black and ethnic minority communities, which are disproportionately affected by the virus.
A survey by Northeastern, Harvard, Rutgers and Northwestern Universities found that 52% of African American respondents are likely to seek a vaccine, compared with 67% of whites. 
""Looking at our community surveys in New York City, Black Americans are more distrustful, and with good reason,"" said Ratzan. He highlighted the infamous Tuskegee case, in which Black men were unknowingly made part of an 40-year experiment from 1932 in which they were not told they had syphilis or given sufficient treatment. 
He also referred to fears around sterilization. Reports indicate people with Mexican-sounding names were more likely to face forced sterilization in California between 1909 and 1979.
Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said in a Thursday briefing: ""People need to be allowed to have a conversation about vaccines, and have a proper conversation. It's not a one-way street. It's not about shoving things down people's throats. It's about having a proper discussion, good information, good discussion on this -- and people will make up their own minds.""
 ""I think science and government have a job to do that is to make the case. I think communities and people have a job to do, which is to listen to that case, and hopefully the result of that will be a widely accepted successful vaccine that could bring this pandemic to an end,"" Ryan said.
Experts say we need a strategy for when a vaccine is produced, covering who will receive one first, how and where it will be distributed, possible different options, and how concerns will be addressed.
In June, Fauci said there was an extensive plan for reaching out to the community, but details have not been released.
Ward emphasized that this is not just about convincing people a vaccine is safe but about doing everything possible to ensure it really is. ""When you produce a new vaccine with such speed, it's not just communication, it's also transparency and making the right decisions,"" he said.
Johns Hopkins University has produced a plan for readying populations for a vaccine, which covers informing expectations; earning public confidence; ensuring availability; communicating in personal terms; and establishing independent bodies to ensure public ownership.
Community groups including the National Black Church Initiative have been working to ensure sufficient numbers of African Americans participate in vaccine trials. Ratzan said involvement from respected community members was vital to ensure people feel ""they're being listened to, their concerns are met, and that the vaccine they are getting is held to the highest standards of safety and efficacy.""
The timeline is vital. Ratzan added that with a new medicine, 18 months could be spent working with companies, medical groups and doctors and thinking about branding, social media or text campaigns. ""We don't have any of that now,"" he said."

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorization to Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect COVID-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. 
SalivaDirect, the fifth saliva test approved by the FDA for the disease, requires no swab or collection device and uses spit from people suspected of having the coronavirus, the agency said bit.ly/3fZyX30.
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn called the test “groundbreaking” in its efficiency and in being unaffected by crucial component shortages. 
SalivaDirect is seen as a cheap, simpler and less invasive testing method that requires no extraction of nucleic acid and can use several readily available reagents. 
The NBA has used the test in a program involving asymptomatic players, coaches and staff from various teams, after partnering with Yale in June, the school said bit.ly/3iOlYmf in a separate statement. 
“We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,” Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health, said. 
One of the goals of the research team was to eliminate the need for expensive saliva collection tubes, and a separate study found that the virus is stable in saliva for prolonged periods at warm temperatures, and that preservatives or special test tubes were not necessary, Yale said. 
The FDA said the test could lower the risk to healthcare workers from collecting samples as it is self-collected under the observation of a healthcare professional. (Reporting by Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Chang and Will Dunham)"

For decades, producers like Herman Miller Inc and Steelcase Inc focused on selling through their own dealers to companies that bought ergonomic chairs and desks by the truckload and employed teams of designers and technicians to deliver and install them. None of them were prepared for a flood of orders for a single adjustable desk from stay-at-home workers suddenly trying to figure out how to conduct Zoom meetings from spare bedrooms. 
Early in the pandemic in late April, 52% of employed Americans said they were always working from home to avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus, while another 18% reported sometimes working from home, according to a survey by Gallup. A later survey found half said they’d like to continue doing this permanentlyincluding 27% who cited both a preference for remote work and fear of the coronavirus. 
When Alphabet Inc’s Google told employees in May the company would reimburse up to $1,000 to outfit home offices, most of the options they found were inexpensive imports sold by big box stores or Amazon. 
“A Tsunami hit this industry with this pandemic,” said Ron Wiener, chief executive of iMovR, a maker of adjustable desks in Seattle. “The big companies simply weren’t structured to serve people from home.” 
Steelcase, the largest U.S. office furniture maker, and Herman Miller, the No. 2 producer, both reported steep losses and double-digit sales declines in the three months ending in May. For Steelcase, sales of about $483 million were the lowest since its initial public offering in 1998. 
Investors have figured out just how dire their situations have become as some experts predict the virus will largely kill off large offices as more companies find they can operate with workers dispersed, saving on costly real estate. 
Even as the wider stock market has nearly recovered all of its losses from the early days of the outbreak, shares of Steelcase and Herman Miller remain deep in the red. Steelcase shares fell 69% from their 52-week high after the pandemic hit - and are still off 51%. Shares of Herman Miller fell over 71% and are still down over 50%. 
Herman Miller and others say they’ve made strides in expanding their online options since the pandemic hit and have found other ways to sell to individuals. 
Lori Gee, vice president of workplace performance services at the Zeeland, Michigan-based company, said they quickly set up a way for Google employees to buy directly from the company, for instance. 
“Part of this has been an acceleration of what we were already doing - to make it easier to get the best set up,” regardless of where the furniture would go or the size of the order. 
HIGH PRICES, LOGISTICS CHALLENGES 
Manufacturers of many other goods have pivoted to new products, including things needed to fight the pandemic, or stepped up services to make up for other lost business. 
Office furniture makers have had a harder time, in large part because of logistical challenges. The average work-at-home customer, for instance, wants a product that can be sent by a delivery service in a single box and can be easily assembled - ideally without needing special tools. 
Price is also a factor. An Aeron chair, a classic design sold by Herman Miller, comes in versions that can easily cost $1,000. Workstations in offices can cost even more, depending on their complexity and added features, such as adjustable desktops and built-in arms to hold computer monitors. Workers stuck at home are far less likely to splurge on such expensive options, at least in part because many are worried about keeping their jobs. 
The way big companies make their products is a complicating factor. Many producers have outsourced component production, buying bases from one company, for instance, desktops from another, and assembling them into configurations according to the design laid out for a large operation. 
“We’re not used to dealing with the end user - if we get a call from a customer about a missing screw, we’re not set up to handle that,” said Soren Stig-Nielsen, president of LINAK U.S. Inc., the U.S. division of a Danish company that makes many of the world’s actuators for lifting bases on desks to adjust height. The company has a large factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and sells its equipment to most of the big domestic furniture companies, including Steelcase. 
“COVID has created huge demand in the home office area,” said Stig-Nielsen, “and traditionally we have not been a big player in that market.” 
Meanwhile, the industry is not giving up on actual offices. 
Herman Miller’s Gee said it is unclear how long the slump in building new centralized offices will continue. But she said the company’s designers are already working on concepts for a new style of working, including more “small, satellite offices” that they believe companies will want to set up to serve workers more widely dispersed than in the past. 
“We think there will always be the need for a physical workplace - places where you go for collaboration and bring to life the corporate culture,” Gee said. (Reporting by Tim Aeppel; Editing by Dan Burns and Diane Craft)"

Police in Miami, Florida -- what experts call the country's coronavirus epicenter -- issued more than 300 citations in 10 days to individuals and businesses that aren't abiding by the local mask order. 
""The growth rate (of cases) has shown flattening since we implemented the masks in public rule and we're following the advice of our health care professionals and our hospital administrators who are telling us that what we have to do now is focus on enforcement,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez told CNN Sunday. ""We created a special task force just for that and we've been issuing hundreds of tickets over the course of the week.""
The county has reported more than 100,000 coronavirus cases -- more cases than all but 12 states. Over the weekend, ICUs were at 137% capacity and there were about 334 patients on ventilators, about a 64% increase in two weeks, according to county data. 
While Florida's governor hasn't ordered a statewide mandate, Miami-Dade County announced earlier this month it was tightening restrictions around its order on face coverings by punishing violators with a $100 fine. About 150 citations have gone to businesses and 174 citations to individuals, said Miami-Dade Police Department Detective Alvaro Zabaleta. 
In Indiana, where a statewide mask order went into effect Monday morning, sheriffs in at least four counties said they wouldn't enforce the mandate, according to CNN affiliate WXIN. 
""If a disturbance or other issue were to develop, deputies would respond as always; however, we will not respond solely for allegations of a violation of the executive order,"" said Johnson County Sheriff Duane Burgess, according to the affiliate. 
In Ohio, where the governor issued a statewide mask order last week, one sheriff already said earlier this month he wouldn't be enforcing any sort of mandate, according to CNN affiliate WLWT.
""I can tell you this -- I am not the mask police. I am not going to enforce any mask-wearing. That is not my responsibility. That is not my job. People should be able to make those choices themselves,"" said Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones. 
And even major retailers, like Walmart, who made headlines last week for new mask requirements for their customers, now says it won't prohibit anyone who refuses to wear a face covering from shopping in their stores. 
But public health experts have highlighted that if Americans wore face masks and practiced consistent social distancing the effects could be drastic: Cases could begin to slow in a matter of weeks and the impact of both precautions could be nearly as effective as another round of lockdowns. 
12 states report more than 100,000 cases
With a continuing upward trend, California is leading the country with the highest number of total infections -- more than 452,280 --- followed by Florida, New York and Texas. 
At least 36 counties are on California's watch list and have been ordered to close many of their indoor operations. More than 8,100 deaths across the state have so far been linked to the virus and at least 6,912 people are hospitalized with 1,993 people in ICUs. Health officials said that the state's positivity rate, a key indicator in how fast the virus is spreading within a community, is on the rise. 
That positivity rate -- the number of people testing positive compared to how many are getting tested -- is at about 7.5%, according to state data. For comparison, New York has brought its rate down to about 1%, a statistic the governor touted as ""really great, great news."" Miami-Dade County's positivity rate is at about 18%, according to county data. 
In Texas, the death toll surpassed 5,000 Sunday, after the state reported 153 fatalities in a day. Across the state, at least 10,075 people are in hospitals. 
In Louisiana, which has reported more than 107,500 infections, health officials said Sunday about 94% of the 3,840 new cases reported Sunday were tied to community spread, rather than places were residents congregated together.
The US currently has 4.2 million coronavirus cases, a fourth of the global total of 16.2 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. There have been more than 146,000 deaths in the US. Globally, the death toll is more than 648,000.
Communities will have to decide school openings
With just several days left in July, educators across the country are working to determine what happens when it's time for students to return to class. 
Guidelines released from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week came down hard in favor of reopening schools, saying children don't suffer much from the virus and are less likely to spread it than adults. The guidelines recommend local officials keep schools closed if there is substantial, uncontrolled transmission of the virus in an area. 
There won't be a uniform threshold for when schools should reopen, Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. 
""Each community is going to have to make the determination about the circumstances for reopening, and what steps they take for reopening,"" Azar said. ""But the presumption should be that we get out kids back to school and figure out how to make that happen."" 
Echoing that claim Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House's Coronavirus task force told CNN that while the presumption is that children need to be in school, some communities may have to tamper with their reopening strategies if virus transmission is too high. 
""There is no one size that fits all,"" he said.
While the Trump administration has remained steady in its message in recent weeks that it wants schools to reopen, educators have protested a return to school next month, arguing that even if children don't experience the virus in the same ways, the decision to return could be deadly for teachers and staff.
Phase 3 of vaccine trial starts this week
While much of the world has pinned its hopes on a vaccine to help combat the virus, at least one vaccine trial in the US is moving to the third phase of testing this week. 
The vaccine is being developed at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in partnership with the biotechnology company Moderna. Phase 3 of the trial is expected to involve 30,000 volunteers and will test whether the vaccine protects people against the coronavirus.
Early results from the Phase 1 study showed that the vaccine, given at three different doses, triggered an immune response in the people who received it (the higher the dose, the higher the immune response). More than half of the participants experienced side effects including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain and pain at the injection site. 
Former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden highlighted the importance of public trust in the vaccine process. 
""There are no secrets here, it's very important that we maintain, gain, increase trust in this whole process or people are going to be confused, concerned and they're not going to take the vaccine,"" he said on Sunday.
His comment comes about a week after former US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said that about half of Americans would likely not get the coronavirus vaccine if it was available because of a lack of trust.

Two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), have a list of 147 nursing homes where at least one resident has contracted COVID-19. But The Washington Post reports that the agencies are refusing to release this list to the public.
""According to CDC data shared with CMS, 147 nursing homes across 27 states have at least one resident with COVID-19,"" the CMS wrote in the sixth paragraph of a Monday press release about increased nursing home inspections. But when the Post asked the CMS for the list, the agency referred the paper to the CDC. A CDC spokesman told the Post that he was ""not sure"" the list would be ""released at this time.""
""It's terriblepeople have a right to know where this is happening,"" nursing professor Charlene Harrington told the paper. ""These nursing homes should be made public so that people have the option to take people out.""
Nursing homes are a particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic because elderly people are at much higher risk of dying from the coronavirus. It's difficult to quarantine residents in nursing homes because most have staff that care for patients and then return home.
Some nursing homes have publicly announced when residents or staff contract COVID-19. A public announcement allows anyone who lives, works, or visits the facility to take added precautions. It's not clear how many of the 147 facilities on the CDC list have been disclosed publicly.
The Post notes that Florida officials have also come under pressure to release a list of 19 Florida nursing homes with COVID-19 outbreaks. Florida officials have declined to provide the list, citing privacy laws."

As with previous pandemics that attack the lungs, one of the biggest worries about COVID-19 is that we simply won't have enough ventilators to treat critically ill patients. It's a valid concern, based on reports from Italy. The US government has confirmed that the nation has a stockpile of more than 10,000 ventilators, but President Trump also recently told Twitter that it should be the states' responsibility to buy these vital life-saving devices.
Over the past few days, there have been growing calls to mobilize advanced manufacturing industries to meet this need, and on Wednesday night, Elon Musk replied to a fan on twitter that his companies ""will make ventilators if there is a shortage.""
We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2020
However, the rocket and electric car billionaire also used the social media platform to downplay the seriousness of the situation, despite increasingly scary predictions from public health experts that appear to have woken the US government from its complacency.
Over in the UK, where there are fewer than 6,000 ventilators available to its National Health Service, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already called for industrial mobilization. Companies including Rolls-Royce (the jet engine maker, not the car company), Airbus, and Jaguar Land Rover have been asked if they can help address the pending shortage, and blueprints have been sent to more than 60 firms, according to The Guardian.
Meanwhile in Italy, supply chain issues and the lack of a critical part has seen at least one hospital turn to 3D printing to keep the machines running. Since no good deed goes unpunished, the original manufacturer of the vital valvewhich it could not supplyhas threatened to sue the printer."

But as an avid movie buff, will he be returning to movie theaters -- which already were in crisis -- amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic even if they institute social distancing practices?",https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/opinions/movie-theaters-covid-19-social-distancing-wellness/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200824165957-paris-theater-new-york-restricted-super-tease.jpg,2020-08-25T08:20:46Z,"(CNN)I admit it. I miss going to movies as opposed to just watching them at home. When the pandemic closed down theaters and multiplexes, I thought: big deal. Screens are screens. Movies are movies. I'll be OK. 
And I have been more than OK: What's the problem with going through a few more loops in my life of, say, ""Chinatown,"" ""Beat the Devil,"" ""Repo Man"" or ""The Godfather: Part II""? 
Or, for that matter, downloading such first-run movies as ""Da 5 Bloods,"" ""First Cow,"" ""Emma,"" ""Shirley,"" ""Crip Camp"" and so many other award-worthy made-for-TV series such as ""I Know This Much Is True,"" ""Unorthodox"" and the so-far-remarkable ""Lovecraft Country.""
As I say: That's more than OK. 
Now there is talk of reopening theaters for business. I don't know about this. But just the implication of this prospect that's stirring something deep within me; a kind of singular romance that has little to do with dinner-and-a-movie dates. 
This is what I'm talking about: Back in 1989, the New York writer Phillip Lopate published an essay looking back almost 30 years earlier to what he recalled as a ""heroic age of moviegoing."" 
It was the hinge of the 1960s when landmark films by such foreign directors as Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, Francois Truffaut, Akira Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman and others were arriving fresh on America's doorstep to ignite in the imaginations of young film lovers bold and stirring possibilities for the art form. 
At the same time, there was similar excitement for those same film lovers in rediscovering the hidden glories of vintage Hollywood movies made by such myriad directors as Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, John Ford, William Wellman and Alfred Hitchcock. 
It was all the same to Lopate, at the time a Brooklyn high school student and budding film buff, who set off in determined, near-quixotic pursuit of obscure, undervalued or challenging movies in small theaters and repertory houses all over Manhattan.
""Whether the film had been glorious or dull barely mattered, so long as I could cross it off my list. The development of a taste of any sort requires plodding through the overrated as well as uncovering the sublime. If the movie had been genuinely great, I would leave the screening place inspired and pleasantly conscious of my isolation and wander the streets for a while before taking the subway home. 
""I came to love the way the gray city streets looked after a movie, the cinematic blush they seemed to wear. When the film had been a disappointment well then, all the more was it a joy to get back the true world, with its variety and uncanny compositions.""
It's a long way from 1959 and for that matter, 1989, when Lopate wrote that essay, and 1999, which I remember as one of the very best years for going to big dark rooms with big white screens. ""The Matrix"" came out that year and so did ""All About My Mother,"" ""The Iron Giant,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Election,"" ""The Insider,"" ""Office Space,"" ""Galaxy Quest,"" ""Three Kings"" even ones I didn't like as much like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""American Beauty,"" ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace."" You get the idea. Pretty good year, no? 
Lopate's kind of romanticism and most of the intimate movie houses that nurtured it now seem as out of reach to contemporary minds as rotary phones and rabbit-eared TV antennae.
But I'm still the kind of fool for film who at odd hours of the day likes running off by myself to dark rooms that smell like buttered popcorn just to see movies that don't get the kind of noisy hype as a superhero tentpole extravaganza. 
I'm not the only one, either. There are several of us who yearn for low-budget gems that follow us home to give us something new to dream about. It doesn't matter to us whether the movie talks, or, depending on the mood we're in, makes much sense. 
""The fact is I am quite happy in a movie, even a bad movie,"" said Binx Bolling, the New Orleans stockbroker and title character of Walker Percy's 1961 novel, ""The Moviegoer."" 
""Other people, so I have read, treasure memorable moments in their lives. ... What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men as he was falling to the dusty street in Stagecoach and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway of The Third Man.""
Understand? The thing about moviegoers like Binx and me is that social distancing in a movie theater isn't a problem: It's the whole point.
So, you'd think movie lovers like me would be over the moon over the prospect of movie theaters reopening after months of Covid-19-related inactivity.
Let's think this through.
One hears that the seating arrangements even in multiplexes will keep viewers farther apart from each other. Screened-off areas, tightly controlled movements ... It all sounds ... familiar. 
Even before the pandemic, it was hard to find any multiscreen complex in New York City and elsewhere that didn't require you to reserve your seat, or seats, in case you brought dates, spouses, children, friends and others. At first it was a hassle, but if audiences wanted to see ""Black Panther"" or ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" badly enough, it was an adjustment they were willing to make.
And I wanted to see them badly, too. As hopelessly romantic about arcane and vintage cinema as I am. I know life isn't all Godard revivals and indie documentaries. But as with everybody else these days, I can get those more easily on streaming networks than in a theater. I can make my own popcorn and find my own seat without stumbling. 
As quiet as it's kept, theaters were in trouble before Covid-19 placed them on lockdown. Back when I was a full-time film reviewer in this century's first decade, my peers and I would notice that another movie exhibitor had gone out of business and not just one of those aforementioned repertory houses, but a once-prosperous first-run commercial theater complex. 
News came this past week of the permanent closure of The Landmark at 57 West in Manhattan, an eight-theater movie complex with luxury seating that offered such ""prestige"" product as Netflix's ""Roma"" and ""Marriage Story"" to its Upper West Side clientele. 
Two years before, the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, which likewise offered diverse and critically acclaimed fare to movie lovers a few blocks north, shut its doors for good. 
The same almost happened to the beloved Paris Theater near the Plaza Hotel at 58th Street near Fifth Avenue before it was saved and purchased by ... Netflix, which has proven so far to be just as romantic about the old movie theater experience of discovery as cine geeks like me. 
But the Paris has been closed since March like other bigger theater complexes. Will I go if it opens again? Maybe, if for no other reason than curiosity as to how a Covid-era movie theater experience will work.
Let's put it this way: Few living Americans are bigger movie geeks than Spike Lee and he's on record saying that if there is no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, he's not going to a movie house. Any movie house. Anywhere. At all.
I guess I'm with him because, fundamentally as a movie buff, he's with me. And one has to wonder after all this shakes out, whenever or however it does, whether the movies need the moviegoing experience to survive and thrive as an art form. 
On the one hand, I hate forsaking what was once a beautiful dream life. One the other, there are many ways to dream moviegoing and many ways to love Fellini. Or ""Wonder Woman 1984.""

As the new coronavirus sweeps the US, federal regulators this week began cracking down on companies fraudulently claiming that their products prevent or treat COVID-19.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent joint warning letters to seven companies making false claims.
There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus, FTC Chairperson Joe Simons said in a statement. What we dont need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims.
These warning letters are just the first step, he said. Were prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam.
Collectively, the companies have suggested that colloidal silver, essential oils, herbal tinctures, and teas can prevent or treat COVID-19. As the FDA and FTC point out, they have used a potpourri of terms and pseudoscientific explanations to make their fraudulent claims.
Herbal Amy Inc., for instance, wrote on its website, Corona virus treatment. Stephen Buhner [a self-proclaimed herbal medicine expert] has analyzed how corona viruses infect tissues, what tissues they infect, and the herbs that are useful to interrupt that process, as well as the herbs useful to shut down the cytokine cascade they create.
Herbal Amy sells the three-tincture Buhner Coronavirus Kit for $155 on its website. It is currently said to be sold out on the site.
A company called Xephyr, LLC dba N-Ergetics wrote on its website that its colloidal silver product can treat Coronavirus 2019-NCoVat [sic]... This Chinese Wuhan Flu Pneumonia has a non-traditional remedy that has successfully killed coronaviruses from the flu virus to pandemic diseases, in vitro, for over 100 years.
As the FDA notes, there are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19.
Although there are investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development, these investigational products are in the early stages of product development and have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness, the agency says."

Three New Hampshire residents have sued Gov. Chris Sununu arguing that a ban on gatherings larger than 50 people in the state violates their constitutional rights.

""Anyone can choose not to exercise their God-given unalienable rights, Couture said. We can choose not to assemble if that is our desire. What cannot occur is one man in a position of power deciding to strip us of our rights in the name of safety and without due process.
Another plaintiff, former Republican State Representative David W. Binford, said the order would prevent him from attending meetings of the Grafton County Republican Committee.
The AP reports that a judge on Wednesday denied the plaintiffs' request for an immediate injunction against the governor's order. A hearing is scheduled for Friday at the Merrimack County Superior Court.
""A spokesman for Sununu said Thursday that the emergency order is consistent with actions taken across the country and is clearly within the governors authority,"" the AP reports.
New Hampshire has 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Nationally, there are more than 14,000 confirmed casesup from about 100 at the start of the month.
New Hampshire's response to the coronavirus, of course, is not unusual. Across the country, cities, counties, and states have issued orders banning large gatherings, shutting down schools and restaurants, and in some cases ordering people to stay in their homes aside from a few essential activities."

On May 9th, basic (aka free) accounts will need to use passwords for all meetings. Waiting rooms and host-only screen sharing will be on by default for these free users, too.
These changes come well into lockdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic, and too late for a host of teachers, businesses and personal users who’ve had to deal with trolls and and pranksters interrupting their video chats. Still, it’s an important step that could reassure those relying on Zoom — not to mention reduce incentives to consider alternatives like Google Meet."

Google Meet, Google's newest video chat service, will soon be free for everyone. The service, which was previously locked behind G Suite, is opening up to anyone with a Google account.
Users will be able to access the service at meet.google.com or through the iOS and Android apps. While the service is free now, it won't be free forever. Google says that, after September 30, meetings will be limited to 60 minutes.
If you've never heard of ""Google Meet"" before, don't feel bad. The branding only popped up earlier this month, when Google quietly renamed ""Google Hangouts Meet"" to ""Google Meet."" Hangouts Meet is something we've written about before, and it launched in 2017 as a reboot to Google's enterprise messaging suite, which consisted of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Both of these 2017 enterprise ""Hangouts"" products have no relation to the widely-used consumer-focused ""Google Hangouts"" chat app from 2013, which is still part of Gmail and was a default Android app for a long time. Google claims it wants to merge all the ""Hangouts"" products together, but you can never be sure what the future of Google's disorganized messaging strategy will hold.Just like with its instant messaging strategy over the years, Google has really dropped the ball when it comes to video conferencing apps. Google's first efforts in video chat started with a Gmail video chat in 2008 and peaked with Google Hangouts video chat in 2013. Google has been in video chat for longer than most of its contemporary competition (other than Skype), but a lack of focus and a continual need to shut down one product and then launch a similar product under a different name left the company spinning its wheels for years. If Google could focus and put the company's massive resources behind a single communication suite that is continually updated and maintained, it could have been an industry leader by now. Instead, Google Meet will be Google's third video chat service in the market, after Google Hangouts and Google Duo.
Employees inside the company are apparently frustrated with Google's market position, too. A recent article from The New York Times details how tech giants like Google and Facebook are chasing Zoom, and it ends with a great anecdote:
Late last month, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, held a videoconference with thousands of the search giant's employees using Google Meet, three people who attended the call said. During the session, one employee asked why Zoom was reaping the biggest benefits even though Google had long offered Meet.
Mr. Schindler tried placating the engineer's concerns, the people said. Then his young son stumbled into view of the camera and asked if his father was talking to his co-workers on Zoom. Mr. Schindler tried correcting him, but the boy went on to say how much he and his friends loved using Zoom.
COVID-19's shelter-in-place requirements made millions people turn to working from home. That led to a huge spike in video chat users, but this general availability of Google Meet already seems like it was too late to ride this wave of users. The work-from-home trend started two months ago when Google Meet was still locked behind the GSuite paywall. Zoom was ready and burst into the public consciousness as a result. By now, it seems like most of the people who were going to transition to a video chat app have already done so, and they picked Zoom.
Google doesn't have a strong argument for why someone would switch from Zoom, either. Google alludes to better security in its blog post, but neither Zoom nor Google Meet is end-to-end encrypted. Both are only ""encrypted in transit,"" which anyone who uses an HTTPS connection can claim. Your conversation might be private from the wider Internet, but it's possible that the service provider can view your meeting data. Participating in a meeting also requires a Google account, while Zoom makes it possible to join a meeting without any account at all. Zoom can secure a meeting with only a password, giving it a much lower barrier to entry.
Like most Google launches, not everyone will get access to Google Meet immediately. Google says that availability for Google Meet will slowly roll out to users ""over the following weeks."""

But some experts say asymptomatic infections are common, presenting a huge challenge in the control of the disease. 
WHAT IS ASYMPTOMATIC AND PRE-SYMPTOMATIC? 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines here asymptomatic cases as those who don't show symptoms but have been confirmed infected through a lab test. WHO notes there are few reports of truly asymptomatic cases. 
The incubation period, or the time a person takes to show symptoms after getting infected, is the pre-symptomatic phase, the WHO says. Carriers can infect others during this period. 
Health experts are not yet sure whether asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases are infectious. Some say data so far suggests those cases are probably equally likely to be able to spread infection. 
The WHO agrees that pre-symptomatic carriers are infectious, and adds that there is also a possibility - although little evidence so far - that people who are asymptomatic may also transmit the virus. The WHO had said in early April that there had been no documented asymptomatic transmissions. 
WHAT ELSE DOES CHINA SAY? 
China has reported around 83,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It does not include asymptomatic cases in that total official count, but began reporting them separately on a daily basis on March 31. 
That has raised concerns about Beijing’s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also paint a misleading picture of how the virus spreads. 
“If you watch (such asymptomatic cases) really closely, you would see something ... that probably fits with a more realistic mild disease than a complete asymptomatic,” Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland said. 
“But the term is around now and it’s going to stick. It’s a nice piece of theatre, but I don’t think it’s going to give useful information.” 
Asymptomatic cases under medical observation in China dropped to 357 as of Tuesday from 1,541 as of March 30. 
Wuhan has tested almost its entire population of 11 million and found no new COVID-19 cases. 
Wuhan’s low rate of symptomless carriers is in line with China’s previous reporting, said Zhong Nanshan, the government’s senior medical adviser, adding that the result showed that the country didn’t cover up the epidemic as some U.S. politicians claimed. 
HOW ABOUT REST OF ASIA? 
Some countries in Asia include asymptomatic carriers in their total confirmed cases. 
In Vietnam, which has just over 300 COVID-19 cases, almost 37% were symptomless, according to health ministry data. 
Researchers concluded that asymptomatic infection was common and found two asymptomatic patients had infected at least four other people. 
South Korea, which had early success in taming the outbreak through aggressive testing, said 20%-30% were asymptomatic. A senior health official said the virus could be widely transmitted during the incubation period, but asymptomatic patients were less likely to transmit it. 
Singapore, which has the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia, does not give data on asymptomatic cases but has said an overwhelming majority of positive cases in its crowded migrant workers’ dormitories show mild or no symptoms. 
The Philippines said about 13% of its nearly 19,000 cases were asymptomatic. In India, some 28% of 40,184 people who tested positive between Jan. 22 and April 30 were asymptomatic, according to a study.

The U.S. firm with roots in France, which has long carved out a niche advising states on their debt restructurings, is pitching for more mandates after adding clients including Argentina and Lebanon this year. 
“Countries that have borrowed in a currency that is not their own and don’t have a central bank that can help are being choked,” Pierre Cailleteau, managing director in Lazard’s Paris-based sovereign advisory team, told Reuters. 
“There are going to be many situations of financial distress.” 
Emerging market debt was sold heavily in March as lockdowns were put in place to halt the pandemic but has recovered some lost ground as economies restart and after G20 governments suspended payments owed by some of the poorest countries. 
Lazard executives declined to comment on which countries might be close to needing sovereign debt overhauls involving private creditors. 
Falling prices for raw materials and especially oil major foreign currency earners are among potential triggers for debt restructurings, according to Lazard’s head of France, Jean-Louis Girodolle. 
“The ingredients for there to be other situations of difficulties on the sovereign debt front are there,” he said. 
Belize said recently that it would ask holders of its U.S. dollar bond due in 2034 to agree a deferral of interest payments for six months, citing a devastating collapse in tourism revenues because of the pandemic. [nL1N2DV0RN] 
Falling tourism and textiles earnings are also straining Sri Lanka’s public finances, although its central bank said in May the island would honour all its debt service obligations. [nL8N2D43V9] 
Debt restructurings are likely to be more complex than ever, Cailleteau said, citing increasingly assertive bondholders, the rise of China as a creditor and questions over the approach index-tracking funds might take. 
    “It’s very, very rare that we are going to have situations where you can just open the rulebook and go to chapter one,” he said. 
LAZARD UP FRONT 
A wave of sovereign restructurings could be a potential boon for Lazard and its handful of competitors as the coronavirus outbreak derails company mergers and acquisitions, their other main area of expertise. 
Lazard’s team of 20 sovereign specialists has also been hired by Zambia and Ecuador this year. 
Some of the firm’s star bankers have left, including to competitors vying for the same business, with sovereign debt specialist Eric Lalo jumping ship to Rothschild and former French CEO Mathieu Pigasse joining U.S. boutique Centerview. 
Despite the merry-go-round, one restructuring banker who has pitched for business against Lazard said states were often keen to play it safe, one advantage for the firm. The Lebanese government for example had been reassured to see the bank hired by an “experienced defaulter” like Argentina, he said. 
The fact that Lazard does not lend meanwhile lessens any perception that its advice might be influenced by the potential for underwriting fees, according to David Fanger, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. 
Debt restructurings can be especially drawn-out affairs for advisors, which are mostly paid through success fees. 
Talks in Lebanon, which involve the International Monetary Fund, have been bogged down by internal disagreements, including between the government and the central bank. [nL8N2E72Y4] 
Lazard executives declined to comment on the outlook for Lebanon.

They are interlinked: we will either win on all fronts or fail on all fronts,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told an ILO summit that will be addressed by dozens of heads of state and government via recorded messages.

“Together we have a duty to protect those who protect us,” he said. 
The outlook for the global labour market in the second half of 2020 is “highly uncertain” and the forecast recovery will not be enough for employment to return to pre-pandemic levels this year, the ILO said last week.

The Abidjan-based regional bourse trades shares of 46 companies, including Senegalese telecoms company Sonatel , Burkina Faso’s main telecoms operator, Onatel , and lender Societe Generale Cote d’Ivoire. The bonds of several companies and countries are also listed on the exchange. 
Before the COVID-19 crisis, the equity market had always been bigger. But by end-June the bonds market’s total value had reached over 5.1 trillion CFA francs versus the equity market’s 4 trillion CFA francs. 
In January to June, as the coronavirus epidemic prompted lockdowns around the world, the bond market grew around 20% in value, while the equities market lost 13%. 
“The bond market served as a refuge for investors in the most difficult period that was marked by great uncertainties,” BRVM Chief Executive Edoh Kossi Amenounve told Reuters. 
In the first quarter, the BRVM recorded 1.07 million securities traded on its bonds market - nearly three-times as many as were traded in the same period in 2019. 
Amenounve said one lesson from the crisis was that the bond market could become more and more active over the next decade, including via innovative instruments such as diaspora bonds, green bonds, climate bonds, social bonds and basket bonds. 
The exchange is seeking to accelerate the development of green exchanges with a sustainability and climate focus, as well as improving digital technologies to facilitate cyber trading, he said.

About 24% of the patients given hydroxychloroquine in the study had persisting symptoms over a 14-day period, while roughly 30% of the group given a placebo were determined to have persistent symptoms over the same period. 
The difference was not statistically significant, the researchers said. 
“Hydroxychloroquine did not substantially reduce symptom severity or prevalence over time in non-hospitalized persons with early COVID-19,” the researchers wrote in an article to be published by Annals of Internal Medicine on Thursday. 
The randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 491 non-hospitalized patients. Owing to test shortages in the United States, only 58% of participants were tested for the disease. 
The study “provides strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine offers no benefit in patients with mild illness”, Dr. Neil Schluger, of New York Medical College, said in an editorial on the study, also scheduled to be published on Thursday.

Full dexamethasone trial results released 
The full results of a large randomized clinical trial in Britain - the gold-standard of tests - looking at the steroid dexamethasone confirm the benefits in its use in COVID-19 patients that were hinted at in early findings issued last month. The results, released on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed benefits for people with advanced or moderate disease. Overall, 2,104 COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4,321 to receive usual care. Four weeks later, dexamethasone had reduced the risk of death by 36% among patients who needed mechanical ventilation when they entered the study, and by 18% among those who were receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The drug did not improve survival among patients who were not using oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In an editorial, Dr. H. Clifford Lane and Dr. Anthony Fauci from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the results show the crucial importance of large, well-designed, carefully run, randomized controlled trials. Even during a pandemic, they said, when it might be tempting to simply ""give all therapies a chance,"" in order for patients' outcomes to improve ""there will need to be fewer small or inconclusive studies and more studies such as the dexamethasone trial.""

Immune cells may recognize the coronavirus years later 
Researchers in Singapore are not worried that antibodies to the novel coronavirus fade quickly. More important, they said, is that immune system cells called T cells and B cells ""remember"" the virus and can trigger an immune response. As reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the researchers looked for ""memory"" T cells in 36 COVID-19 survivors, 23 survivors of the 2003 coronavirus that caused SARS, and 37 people who never had either illness. All COVID-19 survivors had T cells that recognized the novel coronavirus. The SARS survivors all had T cells that remembered the 2003 virus - and their T cells also recognized the new coronavirus. Furthermore, more than half of those who were never infected with either coronavirus had protective T cells, suggesting they may have encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and there may be some pre-existing immunity to the new coronavirus in the general population. ""We find the present discussion about 'antibodies are fading away' a little pointless,"" three of the researchers told Reuters in a joint email. ""What is important is that a level of B and T cell memory remain to be present to quickly start an effective immune response able to stop viral spread,"" said Anthony Tanoto Tan of Duke-NUS Medical School, along with colleagues Nina Le Bert and Antonio Bertoletti. T cells can kill infected cells to slow the virus down, and they also help instruct B cells to produce antibodies, the researchers said. (go.nature.com/2OwM9B5) 
Low interferon levels identify high-risk COVID-19 
Low blood levels of a type of interferon (IFN) could identify COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interferons are naturally occurring proteins that help the body's immune system fight infection. In a study published on Wednesday in the journal Science, researchers found that severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients had severely impaired production of IFN type I, persistent virus in the blood and an excessive inflammatory response. They said the findings support the potential value of treating these patients early on with IFN, combined with anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids such as dexamethasone in the most severely ill people. They also found that low plasma levels of type-I IFN were seen before patients began to deteriorate and require intensive care. ""Levels of circulating Type 1 IFN could even characterize each stage of disease, with the lowest levels observed in the most severe patients,"" they said in a news release. (bit.ly/398r4Xe) 
Heart disease may underlie mysterious blood findings in COVID-19 patients 
Severe COVID-19 predominantly affects the lungs, but elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein released during heart injury, also are common. To learn more, cardiologists in London performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans in COVID-19 survivors who had at least mildly elevated troponin levels while hospitalized. Among 29 people with no obvious reason for elevated troponin, such as a heart attack, they found two patterns of myocarditis, or heart muscle inflammation. In patients with one pattern, heart function seemed unaffected. These patients should undergo cardiology follow-up to monitor for any potential long-term consequences, Dr. Dan Knight of the Royal Free Hospital told Reuters. The other pattern, seen in roughly a third of patients, was associated with reduced blood supply to the heart, or ischemic heart disease. Many patients in this group ""had important coronary artery disease which was previously unknown but required further treatment"" that would not have been offered had troponin levels not been investigated, Knight said. The main message, Knight added, is that when troponin levels are elevated in COVID-19 patients with no apparent reason, further workup could reveal undiagnosed heart disease. (bit.ly/3958hfc)

A hypothetical scenario presented in the report is that a player could contract the virus during practice or a game and then be placed on the NFI. That designation would mean the team is not required to pay the player. 
While the non-football injury designation is the most pressing concern, the report also said the NFLPA has made other requests of the NFL, such as daily virus testing, the elimination of preseason games and compensation for players who opt out of the upcoming season for COVID-19-related reasons. The NFLPA also wants assurances that the 2021 salary cap will not be reduced because of potential lost revenue in 2020.

A rehabilitation centre will work similar to the government’s health-focused COVID-19 administration, but its task will be addressing economic issues, said Kobsak Pootrakool, deputy secretary-general of the Prime Minister’s Office. 
“From now on, it must be a balance between disease issues and the mouth and stomach of the people,” he told reporters. 
The government plans to extend debt moratoria for small-and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from October as the pandemic is likely to continue for a while, he said after meeting the prime minister, economic agencies and the private sector. 
Although Thailand has had relatively few cases and no domestic transmissions for more than one month, the global impacts of the pandemic have hit the economy badly. 
The central bank predicts the economy will shrink by a record 8.1% this year. 
A planned 50 billion baht ($1.6 billion) fund to aid SMEs will be considered by the state planning agency, which is supervising some spending under the government’s 1 trillion baht of borrowing to help recovery from the pandemic. 
Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana said he had asked to increase credit guarantees to help more than 40,000 small firms borrow 45 billion baht from banks. 
“The most urgent issue for SMEs is liquidity because it directly affects jobs,” he said, adding SMEs employed 80% of the total workforce.

Remdesivir has become the treatment of choice for many countries against severely ill COVID-19 patients after the intravenously-administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial. 
The Australian approval broadens the use of remdesivir around the world - the United States has cleared it for emergency use and the European Commission has conditionally approved the treatment. 
It is also approved as a COVID-19 therapy in Japan, Taiwan, India, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. 
Australia has been struggling to contain a COVID-19 outbreak in the country’s second most populous city and on Friday said it would halve the number of citizens allowed to return home from overseas each week.

The matches, played without spectators, were preceded by a minute’s applause for medical workers. The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 22,000 people and killed 188 in the Central Asian country. 
Kairat moved two points clear at the top of the standings after goals by Armenian midfielder Kamo Hovhannisyan, Polish midfielder Konrad Wrzesinski and striker Artur Shushenachev secured a 3-0 win over Zhetysu. 
The two-times Kazakh champions are top with nine points from four games, two points ahead of Astana, who won six titles in a row from 2014-19, and Tobol. 
Kostanay-based Tobol beat Caspiy 2-0 with late goals from Azat Nurgaliev and Oralkhan Omirtayev, both sides fielding second-string teams due to a number of positive coronavirus tests. 
Caspuy coach Srdjan Blagoevich also stayed home because of the virus. 
“Both teams were in a difficult situation,” said Tobol coach Grigori Babayan. “We have about 10 people missing the game, the opponents have the same problems. 
“We need the support of our fans but we understand that the health of Kostanay people and all Kazakhstan people is more important.” 
Kaisar’s Bulgarian coach Stoycho Mladenov announced on Monday that 10 senior players and 15 juniors had tested positive for the coronavirus but the club said all senior players had registered negative results on re-testing.

That’s a problem for the “Gabola” church the name means ‘drinking’ in the local Tswana language for whom a tipple is an integral part of their religious worship. 
Founded just two years ago, the church tried to hold its usual meetings in local bars, called shebeens, to praise God while downing whisky, but they soon got arrested, its leader and self-styled ‘pope’ Tsietsi Makiti, 55, told Reuters. 
“They can arrest us until Jesus comes back,” said Makiti, wearing a bishop’s mitre with a miniature bottle of spirits hanging off it. 
But he added they had been moving services from place to place to avoid a run-in with the authorities. 
On Sunday worshippers met in a rubbish-strewn field in Evaton, south of Johannesburg. As the service started, the ‘clergy’ blessed some beer bottles in prayer. 
“At Gabola church you (bring)... the liquor of your choice... and the pastor will bless the liquor so that it will not be poisonous to your body,” Makiti said. 
Wearing flowing black robes and coloured scarves, Makiti and five ‘clergymen’ - none of them are ordained - sat before a table strewn with empty bottles of alcohol. 
Makiti’s sermon included such proclamations as: “We are a church that will remake the world.” 
“People call me a drunkard,” said one worshipper, Nthabiseng Kotope, 38, who said she joined the church in March. 
“I agree with them. I do God’s work while drinking.” 
Apart from the ban on alcohol, the congregants observe all other coronavirus rules, including the limit of 50 people, the spacing out of chairs and use of hand sanitisers. 
While some Protestant sects teach that alcohol is sinful and to be avoided, most mainstream Christian churches are not opposed to moderate drinking, citing such Biblical stories as Jesus turning water into wine at a wedding feast.

The state recorded 74 cases new cases on Sunday, after Saturday’s 108 cases prompted Premier Daniel Andrews to order about 3,000 people not to leave their homes for at least five days and to place police to guard the buildings. 
“This is not going to be a pleasant experience for those residents, but I have a message for those residents: this is not about punishment but protection,” Andrews said in a televised conference. 
Promising two weeks of free rent and hardship payments to the residents, Andrews said public health workers would test every resident of the buildings, except those who have previously tested positive. 
The communal nature of the facilities, which house people on low incomes, has “genuinely explosive potential for the spread of the virus,” said Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton. 
In addition to the complete lockdown orders, more than 30 Melbourne suburbs are also under strict social-distancing orders, but people there can leave their houses to go to work, school or to buy groceries. 
Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, reported 14 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, all returning travellers from overseas. 
Overall, Australia has weathered the coronavirus pandemic better than most other nations, with just over 8,400 cases and 104 deaths so far, but the recent spike in Victoria is being closely watched by the rest of the country, which has moved to ease restrictions.

“I have tested positive for COVID-19. Under (medical) advice I have isolated myself at home &amp; taking all precautions. I have mild symptoms. Please keep me in your kind prayers,” State Minister of Health Zafar Mirza said on Twitter. 
Pakistan has so far confirmed more than 229,831 cases with 4,762 deaths, according to government figures. The country has continued to confirm around 4,000 new cases per day, despite daily testing numbers falling. 
A number of high level officials have tested positive in Pakistan, including Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi who announced he had the virus on Friday, just days after meeting with U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad. 
The Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed and the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Asad Qaiser have also contracted the virus. 
On Monday, 48 doctors resigned in the eastern city of Lahore, one of the hardest hit areas by the virus. Salman Haseeb, president of the Young Doctors Association for Punjab, said the resignations were due to low morale in the stretched health system due to poor working conditions. 
“See the lack of seriousness of the government during the deadly pandemic that it is accepting resignations instead of addressing the doctors’ problems at this critical time when more doctors are much needed in Pakistan,” he said. The spokesman for the Punjab Health Department, Syed Hammad Raza, told Reuters that the resignations were not related to COVID-19 and were due to personal reasons, and that doctors had enough protective equipment and received extra bonuses for working during the pandemic.

“Credit spreads have narrowed for both investment-grade and high-yield bonds, markets are functioning in an orderly manner, and credit provision to the economy has held up,” Quarles told an event in Washington. 
“The next phase will inevitably involve an increase in non-performing loans and provisions as demand falls and some borrowers fail,” said Quarles, who is also vice chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
The FSB coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20). 
The FSB needs to respond to how the financial sector is changing, with share of bank assets as a percentage of total financial assets dropping from 46% in 2008 to 39% in 2018, Quarles said. 
“As non-bank financial institutions increase their market share, risks have moved outside the banking system,” he said. 
“There may be lessons for us to learn about the framework that we need to apply to this sector, which is different from and less developed than the one used for banks.” 
The FSB will evaluate the rules introduced after the last financial crisis for money market funds, which were once again “front and center in the COVID event,” Quarles said.

According to NFL.com, the Monday meeting centered around economic issues with the league’s finances likely to take a hit this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even if fans are allowed to return to stadiums this fall, the venues likely will be limited to partial capacity. 
The sides are set to talk again Tuesday regarding health-and-safety protocols involving the preseason, daily testing, and players opting out of their contracts due to COVID-19, per NFL.com.

The 32-year-old Jansen said he believes he caught the coronavirus from his 4-year-old son, Kaden, about three weeks ago. Kenley Jansen initially tested negative before testing positive in a follow-up exam. 
Jansen said his wife and his two other children also caught the coronavirus after Kaden was diagnosed with COVID-19. Kenley Jansen said he began feeling better on his fourth day with the illness. 
“It’s definitely scary and definitely a disappointment,” Jansen told reporters during a video teleconference. “When my son had it, it was more the disappointment of, ‘Why does my son have it and why not me?’ You just don’t want that to happen to one of your kids. Next thing you know, we all got it. It is scary, man. But at the same time, you have to keep the faith and just fight it.” 
Jansen also had a message for the public during a time when the pandemic is raging out of control in many states and the nation’s death toll exceeds 135,000. 
“It is real,” Jansen said. “Everyone in the world, take it serious. Wear your mask at all times, if you can. Because, trust me, it happens so fast. Once my son got it, I’ve seen how fast it can spread. We tried to do everything, but we all got it in the house.” 
Jansen said he was worried about catching the virus from the outset due to his history of heart issues. 
Jansen underwent a 5 1/2-hour ablation procedure in November of 2018 to fix a defect that triggered an irregular heartbeat issue in the high altitude of Denver, Colo., three months earlier. 
Jansen also underwent an ablation after the 2012 campaign after experiencing irregular and rapid heartbeat issues. 
“I tried to be careful, do everything we could do to try to avoid this virus,” Jansen said. “It happened so fast.” 
All through his family’s fight, Jansen knew he wanted to play this season and the three-time All-Star said he didn’t consider opting out. 
“I always wanted to play,” Jansen said. “I love this game. I wanted to do it for the fans. We’re all going through a tough time right now in this world together. I think this is a good thing, not only for Dodger fans but all baseball fans around the world who have something to watch on TV.” 
Jansen has recorded more than 30 saves in six straight seasons and has 301 in his 10 campaigns, all spent with the Dodgers. He was 5-3 with a 3.71 ERA and 33 saves in 2019. 
The Dodgers are slated to open the season on July 23 against the visiting San Francisco Giants.

With growing fears of a second coronavirus wave nationally, two states extended border restrictions and Australia’s most populous state imposed limits on the number of people allowed in large pubs. 
The changes come as scores of new cases were uncovered in Victoria, the country’s COVID-19 hotspot, despite a return to lockdown last week for nearly 5 million people in state capital Melbourne. 
Active cases in the state rose to nearly 2,000 after another 270 infections were detected in the past 24 hours, authorities said, taking Australia’s total number of cases to about 10,000, with 107 deaths. 
“We haven’t turned the corner yet. I hope to see that this week, but there are no guarantees,” Brett Sutton, Victoria’s Chief Medical Officer told reporters in Melbourne. 
Australia avoided the high COVID-19 casualty numbers of other nations with swift and strict measures, but a spike in community-transmitted cases in Victoria and a rise in new cases in New South Wales has worried other states. 
South Australia cancelled plans to reopen its border to New South Wales on July 20, while Queensland introduced a mandatory two-week quarantine for people who have visited two areas in Sydney’s western suburbs. 
“Our primary responsibility in South Australia is to the health, safety and welfare of all South Australians,” Premier Steven Marshall told reporters in Adelaide. 
New South Wales, which has seen several dozen cases linked to the outbreak in Victoria, said pubs will now be limited to no more than 300 people, responding to an outbreak centred at a large hotel in southwestern Sydney. 
Authorities believe 600 people visited the Crossroads Hotel on July 3, when the outbreak is believed to have begun. 
“Indoor activity, where people aren’t seated is a huge health risk. It increases the chance of transmission,” state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.

There are countless reasons to detest this sub-microscopic parasite that has upended almost every aspect of our lives. But the push to innovate catalysed by this virus could be it’s one saving grace.  
“COVID-19 has accelerated change and is spurring innovation,” says Adrian Tan, partner and head of IP &amp; TMT at TSMP Law Corporation. “A big reset will demand big ideas and those big ideas require IP protection.” 
The Big Reset 
Around the world, hundreds of companies are inventing new ways to beat the virus or to hold it at bay. From vaccines, to temperature surveillance systems or protective gear, the world is racing against this deathly speck. But for innovation to be as productive as possible, intellectual property is key. The best way to harness creativity and enable innovative enterprises to grow is through a reliable IP framework.   
“COVID-19 focused our minds on new, alternative and innovative ways to leverage our IP assets and our brand,” said Choo Wei-Pin, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer at Razer. Typically, Razer is known among gamers for its hardware, but since the pandemic, the company was able to pivot and start a mask production line in just 24 days.(1)  
“If we didn’t have a solid IP portfolio, it would have been difficult for us to do all these things off the back of the Razer brand so quickly,” says Choo, whose company has over 1000 patent and registered designs and about 2000 trademark applications and registrations.  
Aside from thinking of unconventional ways to leverage IP, Choo mentions that in general due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, companies are looking at more collaborative IP strategies. Rather than traditional unilateral IP registration strategies,  companies are engaging more in technology sharing and licensing arrangements.   
With so much sharing of knowledge, contracts that clearly define IP rights between companies help lay out what each party can contribute and how the outcomes of any efforts can be shared. 
Rethinking Business Models 
COVID-19 and its changes to the operating environment (in particular the introduction of safe distancing measures) as a whole is fast tracking digital transformation. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella remarked recently that two years’ worth of digital transformation has taken place in two months.(2) 
And as the world races along this digitisation path, IP’s role in the global economy is becoming more significant. Many of the companies allowing us to carry on in this new normal do not trade in goods but in services, ideas, technology and data.  
Unsurprisingly, as offices remain empty, usage of Microsoft’s Virtual Desktop has grown more than three times(3)  and Zoom’s customer base has spiked by 354% year-on-year(4) It may not be obvious as one joins their fifth Zoom meeting of the day but for that interaction to take place, that technology needed to be protected through IP such as patents. 
As the economy pivots away from traditional brick and mortar platforms, a new consumer has emerged that is focussed on convenience through online retail. Gone are the days where people casually pop into a shop to get their retail fix. This means that businesses need to have a serious rethink about how they engage with their customers and clients. Brands need to make sure they have a robust digital brand protection strategy.(5) 
“During this pandemic, we’ve seen new business models being adopted,” said Andy Lek, Principal and head of the IP practice at Baker McKenzie Wong &amp; Leow “It’s been a challenge for many traditional industries to market their brands and create a buzz. But with these challenges comes new opportunities and with new ideas come IP opportunities too.” 
As businesses adapt to new ways of operating and serving customers, they are using their brands in new ways and need protection for those uses, for example by registering a trade mark.  
Even in the realm of entertainment, musicians and artists that are usually dependent on live audiences are moving into the digital space. In order to help many of these, IPOS recently published a set of FAQs to help content owners understand the IP hurdles relating to distribution of digital content. 
In anticipation of increased demand for IP assistance during the pandemic, IPOS doubled the frequency of its complimentary IP business and Legal Clinics and moved it onto a virtual platform. 
IPOS also launched the SG Patent Fast Track programme in May to accelerate patent applications to just six months, creating the world’s fastest application-to-grant process of its kind. 
No Turning Back 
“COVID-19 is a gamechanger that has pushed us to realise just how hungry we are for technology,” says Adrian Tan. “We wouldn’t have made these changes without the pandemic and there is no turning back.” ”COVID-19 is a gamechanger that has pushed us to realise just how hungry we are for technology,” says Adrian Tan. “We wouldn’t have made these changes without the pandemic and there is no turning back.”  
Companies need to jump on the bandwagon and embrace innovation as opportunities continue to exist in this COVID-19 economy.  As the pandemic corners the world into embracing digitalisation, this is accompanied by a heightened importance of IP in today’s COVID-19 economy.

Preliminary studies in China, Germany, Britain and elsewhere have found that patients infected with the novel coronavirus make protective antibodies as part of their immune system’s defences, but these appear to last only a few months. 
“Most people make them (antibodies), but often they can wane rather rapidly, suggesting there could be little immunity,” said Daniel Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. 
That raises big problems for developers of potential COVID-19 vaccines, experts say - and for public health authorities seeking to deploy them to protect populations from future waves of the pandemic. 
“It does mean that the over-reliance on a vaccine (to control the pandemic) is not wise,” said Stephen Griffin, a Leeds University associate professor of medicine. 
To be truly effective, COVID-19 vaccines “will either need to generate stronger and longer lasting protection ... or they may need to be given regularly”, he said. 
“And those things are not trivial.” 
More than 100 research teams and companies around the world are seeking to develop vaccines against COVID-19, and at least 17 are already in human trials to test efficacy. 
A preclinical trial in pigs of AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine, known as AZD1222, showed that two doses produced a greater antibody response than a single dose. 
So far, however, there is no data from any human trials showing whether any protective antibody immune response would be strong- and long-lasting enough. 
BOOSTER SHOTS 
Jeffrey Arnold, a visiting professor of microbiology at Britain’s Oxford University and a former expert at Sanofi Pasteur, said one reason for the lack of data is simply time: 
The high-speed development and testing of potential coronavirus vaccines has been underway for barely six months - not long enough to show longevity of any protection they offer. 
He and other vaccine and immunology experts also said it does not necessarily follow that waning immunity in natural cases of COVID-19 infection would be the same with vaccine-induced immune response: 
“If we can, we’d want to improve on nature,” he said in a telephone interview. “With vaccines, of course, we’re not infecting with the virus directly, but we’re presenting the surface protein delivered by a different vector, or made in the laboratory and injected into the arm ... so the ideal goal is to do better than infection itself by making the vaccine immunity even stronger than the natural one.” 
Griffin said one approach could be that when viable vaccines are developed, authorities should reckon with getting booster shots to millions of people at regular intervals, or even combining two or more types of vaccine in each person to elicit the best possible protection. 
Practically, however, that presents a vast challenge. “Giving the entire world even one dose of a vaccine is one thing,” he said. “Giving them multiple doses is quite another.”

Nicklaus also said his wife Barbara contracted the coronavirus and added that both of them have recovered. 
“We were very, very fortunate, we were very, very lucky,” Jack Nicklaus said on CBS. “Barbara and I are both of the age both 80 years old that is at-risk age.” 
Jack Nicklaus shared his experiences with COVID-19 during the broadcast of the Memorial Tournament, an event he founded. CBS golf announcer Jim Nantz interviewed Nicklaus during a rain delay. 
Jack Nicklaus said he and his wife were in self-isolation in Florida from March 13 to April 20. 
“Barbara was asymptomatic. I had a sore throat and a cough. It didn’t last long,” Jack Nicklaus said. 
Overall, Jack Nicklaus tested positive four times for the coronavirus and Barbara had three positive tests. 
Jack Nicklaus, who recently tested positive for the antibody, said it would depend on the golfer on whether there is a handshake after Sunday’s round. 
“If the winner wants to shake hands fine,” Nicklaus said. “But I wouldn’t want to put him in that position. I can’t give it to him so we’ll see what he wants to do.” 
Jack Nicklaus won a record 18 Grand Slam events during his Hall of Fame career.

The government on Thursday accelerated plans to make it compulsory to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces amid concerns about renewed flare-ups of COVID-19, especially in areas in western and southern France that had been relatively spared during the height of the outbreak between March and May. 
According to data released on Friday, the disease’s reproduction rate, known as the R0, in Brittany had risen from 0.92 to 2.62 between July 10 and July 14. 
The number is one of several indicators authorities are watching when deciding on whether to reimpose tougher restrictions after ending the country’s lockdown in May. 
A reproduction rate of 2.62 means that each COVID-19 infected person is, on average, passing the disease on to between 2 and 3 other people. A rate of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. 
“It’s a worrying number because it means the epidemic is taking off again,” Eric Caumes, an infectious disease specialist at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris told BFM TV. 
The disease has killed more than 30,000 people in France. While it has been under control with fatalities and number of people in intensive care falling, daily cases have increased ahead of the summer holiday season, where people are gathering in larger groups and travellers from abroad have been allowed back into France. 
Caumes said Paris hospitals in June had not seen any new virus cases, but that since the start of July, people were beginning to trickle back in similar numbers to February with two or three sick people a day. 
“It is possible that what is happening in Paris is nothing compared to what is happening in other regions of France which were not hit by the first epidemic wave and risk facing an epidemic wave,” he said.

Unlike some of its neighbours, Germany has, rather than locking down its citizens, so far managed the pandemic with less intrusive measures such as closing schools and bars and banning large gatherings. 
Last month, there was public outcry when an outbreak at a meatpacking plant in western Germany led to restrictions being imposed on two districts that are home to around 650,000 people. 
With the summer holiday season just starting, residents were allowed to leave the area, however, though hotels in some other German regions turned them away as high-risk. 
Under the new strategy announced by federal and regional governments, areas with localised coronavirus outbreaks will be closed off more fully, with residents prohibited from travelling beyond their borders. 
But the closures will be enforceable on individual districts rather than only on larger administrative zones, as was the case until now. 
The threshold for localised curbs remains at 50 new infections per 100,000 residents over a one-week period, but local authorities can now restrict non-essential travel into and out of affected areas if that rate is reached or if the extent of the virus’ spread is uncertain. 
To help enforce and police limits on travel, hotels and B&amp;Bs will be prohibited from taking in guests from coronavirus “hotspots” who do not have an up-to-date COVID-19 test showing they have not been infected.

The vaccine, originally known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, was originally developed by scientists at the University of Oxford, and they are now working with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) on development and production. 
It is already in human trials, with preliminary trials on pigs and monkeys showing some encouraging signs for the experimental vaccine, which is also known as AZD1222, in giving protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
William, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson and second-in-line to the throne, met researchers working for the Oxford Vaccine Group, including the vaccine’s developer Sarah Gilbert and the leader of the clinical trial team Andrew Pollard. 
He also spoke to AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, and officials from Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and international vaccine alliance Gavi via a video call. 
AstraZeneca has signed deals with Britain, the United States and European countries to supply the vaccine. 
Soriot has said that trial clinical results are expected in August or September, with deliveries possible from October, adding that he expects the vaccine, if it works, to protect against COVID-19 for about a year.

FIFA’s plan means world soccer’s governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits. 
FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its ‘Forward’ projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women’s football. 
The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a ‘universal solidarity grant’ of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women’s football. 
Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million. 
FA’s will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million. 
“Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions. 
Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds. 
The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations’ desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches. 
Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America. 
The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a ‘test event’ for the 2022 World Cup. 
The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only. 
The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar’s World Cup organising committee.

Dinwiddie told the publication he may not be able to play when the NBA season is scheduled to resume July 30 in the Orlando, Fla., area. 
“Over the past few months, I have been diligent about protecting myself and others from COVID-19 by following all designated protocol and quarantining,” Dinwiddie said in a statement. “I was ready and prepared to rejoin my teammates. ... I flew private to return to New York, passed multiple COVID-19 tests over my first several days in New York and was able to participate in a couple practices within the first week. 
“Originally, we were supposed to be one of the teams to enter into the Orlando bubble early, but training camp got switched back to New York and unfortunately I am now positive. Given that I have experienced symptoms, including fever and chest tightness, it is unclear on whether or not I’ll be able to participate in Orlando.” 
Dinwiddie told The Athletic he will remain in quarantine and be re-evaluated in 14 days. 
The 27-year-old is averaging career bests of 20.6 points, 6.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 64 games (49 starts) during his sixth NBA season. 
In March, four Nets tested positive for the coronavirus, with injured star forward Kevin Durant confirming he was one of the quartet. 
The Nets (30-34) are in seventh place in the Eastern Conference and are solidly positioned for one of the conference’s eight playoff spots. Brooklyn has eight games remaining and is a half-game ahead of eighth-place Orlando and six ahead of the ninth-place Washington Wizards. 
The news about Dinwiddle comes one day after Brooklyn forward Wilson Chandler announced he won’t play in the restarted season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando. Chandler cited a desire to remain with his family. Guard Kyrie Irving (shoulder surgery) and Durant (Achilles) also won’t participate."

Ottawa is usually home to the country’s largest Canada Day party, with tens of thousands of foreign and domestic tourists descending on the capital to celebrate with live music and family fun, capped off with a dazzling fireworks show. 
But in-person festivities have been canceled amid COVID-19 restrictions, with organizers instead offering an online show featuring Canadian pop stars including Alanis Morissette and Avril Lavigne, along with other artists. 
The night will end with Canadians holding their mobile devices to the sky to watch a virtual fireworks show. 
“Canada Day won’t look like previous Canada Days, but there are fun ways to get out and celebrate,” said Jantine Van Kregten, director of communications for Tourism Ottawa. 
Bike paths and beaches have opened in many regions, and Canadians are encouraged to have barbecues within their social bubbles and even a drink on a restaurant patio, while being mindful of social distancing guidelines, Van Kregten said. 
“Everybody wants to do this in a safe way, so we can get back to a more regular way of life sooner rather than later,” she said. 
Cities across the country are adding their own flair to online Canada Day, from social media pancake breakfasts and live-stream magic shows to virtual dog parades and fun runs. 
But Canada Day is facing push back from Indigenous groups, which have organized #CancelCanadaDay marches across the country and will host an online counter-celebration on Wednesday featuring indigenous artists and activists.

Germany has successfully managed to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control with far fewer deaths than most other large European nations despite relatively softer lockdown measures that allowed some social and economic life to continue. 
But an outbreak this month at an abattoir in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia affecting more than 1,500 workers has forced a lockdown for 600,000 people and raised fears that Germany remains vulnerable despite its early success. 
Under current rules, free tests are available for people who have symptoms such as fever and Germany’s 16 states carry out frequent tests among high-risk groups in, for example, retirement homes, hospitals and daycare centres. 
“Corona is still breathing down our necks,” Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder told a news conference, saying the planned universal testing would be “faster, for free and for everybody”. 
The plan has faced criticism that it could overwhelm testing centres and deny higher-risk groups access to testing. 
“Test, test, test, - but make it targeted,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn tweeted about the Bavarian plan. “Simply carrying out a lot of tests sounds good, but without a systematic approach it is not expedient.” 
The state of Berlin has indicated it will follow Bavaria’s decision to diverge from the national testing strategy agreed with the government and the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. 
But North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany’s most populous state - and Baden Wuerttemberg have said they prefer to stick with a targeted approach. 
“For me it is particularly important that we do compulsory (testing) where the fire is,” said Armin Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia."

Campbell joins compatriots Harris English, Denny McCarthy, Cameron Champ and Nick Watney, as well as South African Dylan Frittelli, on the list of PGA Tour players who have tested positive in recent weeks since the Tour resumed earlier this month. 
Three Korn Ferry Tour players, Brandon Wu, Tayloy Montgomery and Jonathan Hodge, also tested positive and have all pulled out of this week’s TPC Colorado Championship as a result. 
The first round of the Rocket Mortgage Classic begins Thursday.

The British Chamber of Commerce said on Wednesday its quarterly survey of 7,700 firms found the share of companies reporting growth in sales was far below even the low point of the global financial crisis of 2007-08. 
“Our results demonstrate the need for swift and substantial action,” the BCC’s director general Adam Marshall said. “The UK cannot meander its way back to success in this era of uncertainty.”  
Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Tuesday to fast-track infrastructure investment and slash property planning rules. The spending announcement of 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) amounted to around 5% of gross public sector investment last year, most of which had already been announced. 
Sunak is due to announce more details of the government’s plans next week, on top of the 133 billion pounds of emergency measures he has rushed out mostly to keep people in their jobs. 
However, Sunak has so far opted not to bring forward a major budget statement which is due in the autumn. 
The BCC said its survey showed orders and investment intentions at record lows for services firms and manufacturers.  
Marshall called on the government to cut employers’ social security contributions and take other measures to help companies keep workers on their books after Britain’s huge state furlough scheme expires at the end of October. 
Companies would need extra investment incentives and help to survive cashflow crunches in the form of wider relief from property taxes and more grants. The government should also take measures to stimulate consumer demand, Marshall said.

Several state lab directors and the director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories also told Reuters that supplies were short. 
Widespread testing is one of the core requirements necessary for controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus, and delays in tests raise the likelihood of transmission. 
“The nascent federal supply effort for COVID-19 testing has been beset by logistical problems that impede our pandemic response and undermine our shared goals,” Washington state Secretary of Health John Wiesman said in his June 30 letter to U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir. 
The supply chain problem ""threatens to limit our overall testing capacity at a critical time in the pandemic response,"" he said. (For a copy of the letter, see: tmsnrt.rs/38uOkyg) 
Two months ago, seeking to address problems in the national supply chain, the federal government started sending states weekly shipments of swabs and chemicals used to gather and preserve specimens for testing. Wiesman thanked Giroir for the help. 
But he said that system is beset with problems, including swabs that have had to be re-sterilized and shipments delayed without temperature control. 
Addressing the state’s concerns about poorly packaged swabs and chemicals specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services said that beginning in July it will provide states with individually wrapped sterile swabs. 
“We are in constant contact with states to overcome any issues with testing supplies and reagents and are working with states to ensure they have testing materials,” said agency spokeswoman Mia Heck in a statement. 
Corporate test makers also are not meeting demand. 
Scott Shone, the director of North Carolina’s public health laboratory, said he had been told by the federal government and clinical labs in his state that Roche would not be able to ramp up production of reagents, chemicals used in tests, until later this year, and that Danaher’s Cepheid would not be able to ramp up supplies until early 2021. 
“The supply chain is just not there to support the growing demand for testing,” he said. 
The concerns about strains in the testing supply chain have emerged in the last two weeks as COVID-19 cases have surged in Texas, Florida, Arizona and California. 
Roche, Cepheid, and every other supplier reached by Reuters acknowledged that demand for tests exceeds supply. All are working to boost production, but none said when they expect to be able to meet demand. 
Joe Saad, chairman of pathology with the Methodist Health System in Dallas, said Texas, a hot spot, does not appear to be receiving priority supplies. “How they’re allocated is a complete mystery to us,” he said. 
Methodist relies more heavily on outside labs when it is short on supply, and tests it can do in six hours in house are taking four to six days from the outside lab, he said. 
Quest Diagnostics, a national independent lab, said on Monday that for all but its highest priority patients, results were taking three to five days because of “surging demand.” Customers had previously told Reuters that their turnaround was usually two to three days. 
Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, says he has heard from a handful of state health laboratories in the last two weeks that they are short on reagents or other supplies they need to do COVID testing. 
He is worried that testing may have to be limited to people showing symptoms, as it was early in the pandemic. “I’m concerned that we are going to be forced to go a little bit backwards.”

In an Instagram post, Robin Duran wrote that his 69-year-old father recently tested positive after originally believing that he had merely the common cold. 
The younger Duran added, as translated from Spanish, “He is not in intensive care or on a ventilator, he is still under observation. We just talked to the doctor and he tells us that the lungs are fine and there is no indication of seriousness. Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well. I’ll keep you informed. Regards!” 
Duran, a Panamanian nicknamed “Manos de Piedra” (Hands of Stone), earned championships in the lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight divisions while compiling a 103-16 record with 70 knockouts. He is widely viewed as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of all time, and the Associated Press ranked him the best lightweight of the 20th century. 
He might be best remembered for a pair of fights against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980. Duran won the world welterweight championship by earning a unanimous-decision victory over Leonard at Montreal in June. Five months later, Leonard won back his title with an eighth-round technical knockout in New Orleans, when Duran was heard by the referee to say “No mas” (“No more”). 
The result ended Duran’s 41-match winning streak. 
In 1989, Leonard beat Duran by unanimous decision at Las Vegas to win the WBC super middleweight championship. 
Duran began his boxing career in 1968 at age 16, and he kept fighting until he was 50 years old, when he lost a unanimous decision to Hector Camacho in 2001. 
He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007."

Vibrations travel through the earth like waves, creating seismic noise from earthquakes, volcanoes, wind and rivers as well as human actions such as travel and industry. 
In the study, published in the journal Science and conducted using international seismometer networks, scientists found that human-linked earth vibrations dropped by an average of 50% between March and May this year. 
“The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record,” they wrote. The work was co-led by the Royal Observatory of Belgium and five other institutions using data from 268 monitoring stations in 117 countries. 
Beginning in China in late January, and followed by Europe and the rest of the world in March to April, researchers saw “a wave of quietening” as worldwide lockdown measures to slow the coronavirus pandemic took hold. 
Travel and tourism were all but halted, millions of schools and industries closed, and many people were confined to their homes. 
The relative quiet allowed scientists to “listen in” in more detail on the earth’s natural vibrations, said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College London who co-led the work. 
“It has yielded a new window on the natural seismic signals, and could let us see more clearly than ever what differentiates human and natural noise,” he said. 
The study said its findings also showed that seismologists can help establish how long people take to react to the imposition and lifting of lockdown measures. 
The largest drops in human-induced vibrations were seen in densely populated areas like Singapore and New York City, but drops were also seen in remote areas like Germany’s Black Forest and Rundu in Namibia. Barbados, where lockdown coincided with the tourist season, saw a 50% drop in seismic noise.

Nordea said the decision to drop JBS from its portfolio was taken after a period of engagement with the company, which is the world’s largest meat producer, that in the end did not produce a satisfactory outcome. 
“We always say that we prefer to engage with the company rather than just begin excluding everything,” Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments, told Reuters by telephone. 
Nordea, which he said has roughly 215 billion euros of assets under management, also has small holdings in two other Brazilian meatpackers, Marfrig (MRFG3.SA) and Minerva (BEEF3.SA). While these companies would not be Nordea’s preferred types of investment, its funds invest in them because they are part of the benchmark in Brazil, according to the executive. 
JBS declined to comment on Nordea’s decision, but said it regrets that it was not contacted by the referred fund recently so that it could present direct evidence of transparency of its relations and of the sustainability of its operations. 
According to Nordea, talks with JBS ahead of the move’s announcement covered issues including risk of deforestation in JBS’ supply chain, corporate governance and the handling of corruption charges, and employee health and safety with regard to COVID-19. 
“It is the weight of all of the issues together,” Pedersen said, referring to fresh claims JBS was “laundering” cattle allegedly sourced from areas of deforestation and failing to protect the workforce amid the COVID-19 pandemic in production plants. 
Another issue is a company of JBS’ size lacking an independent board, Nordea’s Pedersen said.

The potential vaccine - based on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) - is expected to enter clinical trials in mid-August, Biocad chief executive Dmitry Morozov said. The vaccine is one of six vaccine prototypes the Vector Institute is developing, a World Health Organization list showed. 
Biocad is gearing up to produce 4-5 million doses per month of the VSV-based vaccine by the end of this year, if early-stage trials prove it to be safe and effective, Morozov said. 
Biocad plans to handle industrial scale production of the vaccine entirely in-house, from manufacturing the virus strain in its bioreactors to dealing with registration and packaging, Morozov said. 
“We can do it all at our current facilities,” Morozov said, adding there was no need to expand their production capacity to meet output targets. 
“We have received requests about deliveries for export based on the potential success of this vaccine ... on the level of countries as well as private companies,” Morozov said, adding that Biocad had received requests from Egypt, South Africa and Thailand. 
Biocad is in discussions about producing the Vector VSV vaccine in China, where it has a joint venture with Shanghai Pharma launched in September last year. Shanghai Pharma was not immediately available for comment. 
Clinical trials on another of the Vector Institute’s prototypes began on Monday, the state consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said, without providing further details. 
The agency was also not immediately available for comment on Biocad’s role in Vector’s vaccine developments. 
A separate state research facility in Moscow, the Gamaleya Institute, completed early human trials of an adenovirus-based vaccine earlier this month and expects to enter large-scale trials in August. 
More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed to try to stop the coronavirus pandemic. At least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to WHO data - including three developed in China and another in Britain. 
Biocad hopes to set a price of between $10-$15 per dose, Morozov said, both domestically and for export. 
Mass production could begin in late November or early December, if clinical trial results are positive, Morozov said, though the first group to receive the jab would initially remain quite limited before being gradually widened.

Dubbed ‘COVID cards’ by regional government leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who wants to introduce them as a pilot project in September, they would identify holders as coronavirus-free, granting them access to high-risk infection zones including gyms, museums and bars. 
“The key is letting people who are not infectious continue to live a normal life and focusing the precautions on the vulnerable,” Ayuso said on Tuesday. “We are asking for the card to be studied so we can identify who cannot infect or be infected right now.” 
However, at a time when countries are struggling to strike a balance between fighting the virus and respecting civil liberties, experts have questioned the scientific validity of such a system and say it could infringe on privacy rights. 
“A positive COVID-19 antibody result does not necessarily mean you have ‘functional’ antibodies that will protect you from another infection,” Liverpool University epidemiologist Raquel Medialdea tweeted. 
The World Health Organisation has discouraged the use of immunity passports on those grounds, and a large Spanish study into immunity showed 14% of participants with antibodies had lost them when tested again three months later. 
The country has been gripped by a surge in new infections with 13,116 diagnosed in the last seven days, prompting some other regions to re-introduce curbs on movement and gatherings, and the UK government to impose a quarantine on returnees from Spain. 
Madrid, which bore the brunt of the virus’s early April peak but has since managed to keep a lid on new infections, is the first Spanish region to consider a card system. 
Ruben Sanchez, a spokesman for the FACUA consumer-rights group called the idea “ridiculous”, saying it would violate data-protection laws by obliging the bearer to hand over sensitive medical information. 
Iñigo Errejon, leader of the left-wing Mas Madrid party, said Ayuso had failed to hire sufficient virus trackers and been slow to introduce mandatory mask use. He also criticised the card scheme, whose name Rocio Monasterio, a lawmaker with the far-right Vox party, said called to mind post-war ration books. 
There was some support for Ayuso amid all the criticism.

The striking divide in the fortunes of the country’s key tourism industry stems from the distortions in international travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Dubrovnik, the country’s top tourism destination, has become one of the weakest spots on the Croatian coast this year since it is heavily dependent on visitors arriving by air or on cruise ships and those attending conferences and staying in hotels. 
“We hoped to reach some 20-25% in turnover compared to last season,” said Tiffany Cvjetkovic Rudenjak, a member of the family which owns the downtown Lanii restaurant. “We’re still not there, but we hope August can change things.” 
According to Ana Hrnic, director of the city tourist board, at the end of July Dubrovnik saw just 30% of last year’s tourist numbers. For the first seven months of this year the figure is even lower, 13% compared to the same period last year. 
Hrnic said guest numbers had risen since mid-June when air traffic within Europe began to resume and had picked up more since mid-July when Britain eased its travel restrictions since the city is particularly popular among Britons. 
“So far domestic guests and Germans have been among the most numerous, but we expect an increase in arrivals from the United Kingdom in the next few weeks,” Hrnic said. Some 60% of hotels were now open and she said she hoped more would open in August. 
Ivan Maslac, commercial director of Dubrovnik airport, said that in the last two weeks, flights from the UK had been quite packed in the circumstances. The airport offered discounts to airlines on take-off and landing fees and an incentive payment of two euros per passenger, he said. 
Almost 20% percent of Croatia’s economic output depends on tourism and the country hopes that this year it can earn around a third of last year’s tourism receipts which amounted to some 12 billion euros ($14.11 billion). 
At the moment there are some 600,000 foreign guests on the Croatian coast, many of whom are visiting northern Istrian peninsula where the number of guests from Germany and Slovenia exceeded 80% of last year’s figure. 
Easy accessibility by car and accommodation in camp sites and private houses are major factors behind their numbers, said Denis Ivosevic from the Istrian Tourist Board. 
Despite an increase in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks in Croatia, which mostly hit the capital Zagreb and the east of the country, visitors do not seem overly worried. 
Bence Smid, an IT consultant visiting Dubrovnik, had driven from Hungary, crossing a moveable bridge to the island of Murter in the central Adriatic. 
“I wouldn’t say it is dangerous to be here,” he said.

“I waited so long for a job and now I have to start all over again,” he said, wearing a black cap and a broad smile in Berlin’s poor district of Neukoelln. “It’s tough but I’m trying to stay positive.” 
Anakua, who is 46 and has three children, considered himself fortunate because his wife’s job as a security guard at a supermarket was not affected by coronavirus lockdowns. Her wages combined with the unemployment benefits he received were sufficient for them to get by on. 
The pandemic is pushing up unemployment among migrants at a faster rate than among German citizens, hampering the country’s previously successful push to integrate into its labour market the record 1.1 million people who arrived in 2015 seeking asylum. 
Unemployment among migrants, who are largely employed in the services sector that was crippled during a six-week lockdown, rose by 27% from March to June, Federal Labour Office data show. This compares with a 20% increase among Germans. 
“Migrants are more affected by the crisis because they largely occupy jobs that can’t be done from home,” said Herbert Bruecker of Humboldt University of Berlin. “We are talking about jobs in restaurants, hotels, cleaning, transport, and security.” 
With relatively low education levels and language skills, migrants are over-represented in the services sector. The sector is slowly reviving, but is still held back by weak demand. 
About 28% of asylum seekers and refugees were employed either in hospitality or through temporary employment agencies last year, compared with 4% of Germans, a study by the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW Koeln) shows. 
“Migrants are also disproportionately employed in small companies, where employment protection is weaker so layoffs are easier and cheaper,” said Bruecker. “There is also the rule of ‘last in, first out’. All this puts migrants at a disadvantage.” 
GENEROUS SPENDING 
Since 2015, Germany has spent tens of billions of euros on an integration strategy focused on language and vocational training, hoping to get the newcomers off welfare and into work. 
This effort was helped by an economy that had been in its 11th straight year of growth before the pandemic, and by a labour market hamstrung by chronic shortages. 
Almost 40% of migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea, Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia, who make up the bulk of asylum applicants, were employed at the start of the year, up from 16.4% in January 2016. 
Experts had been expecting this figure to hit or even surpass 50% by the end of the year. 
But the pandemic is undoing those gains. 
LOST SOCIAL CONTACT 
The crisis is making integration difficult in other ways. 
As mandatory integration and language courses were moved from classrooms to home-based e-learning and social interactions were limited, migrants lost contact with native speakers. 
“The closure of schools also has an adverse effect on migrant children, whose parents often struggle with home schooling because of weak language skills,” said Wido Geis-Thoene of the economic institute IW Koeln. 
Despite the setbacks, the outlook for migrants remains broadly positive, especially as the economy appears to be on the mend and the fast-ageing population means labour shortages are set to increase, creating more opportunities for migrants. 
“The employment perspective for migrants will be unfavourable for a year or two,” said Geis-Thoene. “But the big picture remains favourable because of the negative demographic development.” 
Germany’s working-age population shrank by 360,000 last year and the trend is forecast to accelerate. 
“We had a surge in migrants coming to us seeking advice after they had lost their jobs in March and April,” said Olga Klus, a consultant with Work and Live, a charity funded by the government’s IQ Network Fair Integration project to assist migrants. 
“It is very sad to see that most have no idea about their rights under German labour laws,” added Klus. “But the situation is starting to stabilise.” 
Almost four months after he had lost his job as a welder, Nigerian Anakua received a call from his former employment agency last week asking him if he would like to come back. 
“I couldn’t believe it. They said their clients are coming back asking for welders and they were satisfied with my work and wanted me back,” he said. “I’m very happy.”

Under pressure from European industry groups, the European Commission last month changed the rules - which Britain still follows during its Brexit transition period - to allow more small firms to receive help. 
“We have stood by business throughout this crisis, and today’s announcement will mean that even more small firms will be able to access much-needed financial support,” small business minister Paul Scully said. 
The state aid rules originally prevented many loss-making companies from accessing government help, a measure that in normal times stops governments from propping up uncompetitive companies to the detriment of firms in other countries. 
Britain’s finance ministry said the changes to the state aid rules would “make sure that small businesses who are not insolvent or receiving rescue aid can benefit, enabling them to bounce back and kickstart our economy”. 
More than 57,000 companies have borrowed 12.65 billion pounds of government-backed loans worth up to 5 million pounds each via the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which is aimed at small and medium-sized businesses. 
CBILS is open to businesses with annual sales of up to 45 million pounds. The expansion of the scheme to include ‘businesses in difficulty’ - a category that includes those with heavy losses - applies to firms with sales of up to 9 million pounds and no more than 50 staff. 
Smaller businesses eligible for the government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which has lent 33.68 billion pounds, were already exempt from the bar on firms in financial trouble.

At least 41 passengers and crew from the MS Roald Amundsen have so far tested positive for the coronavirus, while hundreds more have been told to self-isolate for 10 days, public health officials said. 
“A preliminary evaluation shows a breakdown in several of our internal procedures,” Chief Executive Daniel Skjeldam said in a statement. 
“Our own failure, as well as the recent rise in infections internationally, has led us to halt all expedition cruises in Norwegian and international waters,” he said. 
Norwegian police said they would investigate whether any laws had been broken. 
“We have found grounds to open a case,” Troms Police Lawyer Thomas Rye-Holmboe told Reuters. 
Four of the MS Roald Amundsen’s crew members were hospitalised on Friday when the ship arrived at the port of Tromsoe, and later diagnosed with COVID-19. Tests showed another 32 of the 158 staff were also infected. 
Among the infected crew, 32 were from the Philippines while the rest were of Norwegian, French and German nationality. The foreign crew had been tested for the coronavirus before leaving their home countries but did not quarantine before starting work on the ship, the company said. 
Passengers were allowed to disembark before anyone had been diagnosed, triggering a complex operation to locate them. 
So far, five of the combined 387 passengers travelling on the ship on two separate cruises since July 17 have been found to carry the virus, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Tromsoe municipality said. 
Hurtigruten touted reduced passenger capacity, social distancing and strict rules on hygiene as it became the first operator to return an oceangoing cruise ship to service in mid-June. 
The MS Roald Amundsen had been scheduled to sail around the British Isles in September. Trips with two other vessels have also been suspended, the company said, adding its business shipping goods between Norwegian ports would continue.

“We would like to recognise the efforts of the tournament organisers who have gone to great lengths in exploring all options to run this year’s tournament, despite the many challenges presented by COVID-19,” they said in a statement.

A state research facility in Moscow - the Gamaleya Institute - completed early human trials of the adenovirus-based vaccine this month and expects to begin large-scale trials in August. 
The vaccine will win regulatory approval from authorities in Russia while that large-scale trial continues, the source said, highlighting Moscow’s determination to be the first country in the world to approve a vaccine. 
The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out the vaccine has prompted some Western media to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before solid science and safety. 
“(Regulatory) approval will be in the first two weeks of August,” the development source said. “August 10 is the expected date, but it will definitely be before August 15. All (trial) results so far are highly positive.” 
The source added that Russian health workers treating COVID-19 patients will be offered the chance of volunteering to be vaccinated soon after the vaccine receives the regulatory approval. 
Separately, Russia’s Interfax news agency cited “an informed source” as saying the vaccine would be registered from Aug. 10-12 and be administered from Aug. 15 onwards. 
The press service of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is coordinating and funding Russia’s vaccine development efforts, declined to comment, but its head, Kirill Dmitriev, has denied that Russia’s vaccine push is compromising safety. 
“The Ministry of Health in Russia is following all necessary strict procedures. No corners are being cut,” Dmitriev said on Tuesday. 
Dmitriev likened what he said was Russia’s success in developing a vaccine to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world’s first satellite. 
“Just as Sputnik was the result of very talented Russian scientists ... our vaccine research is based on the work of great Russian scientists,” he said. 
Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre said this month that hackers backed by the Russian state were trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions around the world. The allegations have been denied by Moscow. 
More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. At least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to WHO data, including three developed in China and another in Britain.

Data on children as sources of coronavirus spread are sparse, and early reports did not find strong evidence of children as major contributors to the deadly virus that has killed 669,632 people globally. 
Understanding the transmission potential in children will be key to developing public health guidelines, said the researchers who published the study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. 
Between March 23 and April 27, 2020, a research team from Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital and Northwestern University tested swab collections from inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and drive-through testing sites in Chicago, Illinois. 
The study included 145 individuals aged between one month and 65 years with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were studied in three groups - children younger than five years, children 5 to 17 years, and adults 18 to 65 years. 
Their analysis suggests the young children had a viral load 10-fold to 100-fold greater than adults in their upper respiratory tracts. 
Viral loads in older children with COVID-19 are similar to levels in adults. This study found greater amounts of viral nucleic acid the genetic codes for proteins to produce new viruses - in children younger than 5 years. 
The study only looked at viral nucleic acid and not infectious virus, meaning it is not clear if the children would spread the virus. 
Still, the prevalence in young children raise concerns about their behavioral habits, and their proximity in schools and day care centers as public health restrictions are eased, researchers said. 
In addition to public health implications, the researchers said the results could help put the focus on this population while targeting immunization efforts when COVID-19 vaccines become available.

One leading federation of laboratories said an abrupt July 25 decree to make testing free-of-charge and without prescription piled pressure on at a time many staff go on holiday. Political opponents lampooned a policy in disarray. 
“Testing anyone achieves nothing. You have to be targeted,” epidemiologist Didier Pittet, who heads a government-appointed task force monitoring the handling of COVID-19, told Europe 1 radio. 
France, like many of its European neighbours, is witnessing a mushrooming of new coronavirus clusters. 
The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care rose for the second straight day on Tuesday, reversing a 16-week downward trend. The disease has killed more than 30,000 people in France. 
France is now testing some 576,000 people per week, an Health Ministry spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday, compared with 200,000 when President Emmanuel Macron began easing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. 
The strategy is working, health minister Olivier Veran said over the weekend. “The virus is no longer tracking us, we are tracking it,” he told Le Parisien. 
The ministry’s spokesman acknowledged “localized problems” but was adamant that France had chosen the right strategy. 
But Lionel Barrand, who heads the Syndicat National des Jeunes Biologistes federation, said the open testing strategy amounted to hunting for a needle in a haystack and put laboratories under strain. 
“The government threw sand in our wheels. It sent a lot of people to labs without prior warning,” Barrand told Reuters. 
Frustrated by the reluctance of some laboratories to invest in the manpower and operational changes needed to conduct testing, the government had considered requisitioning some of them, one government official said.

His death underscores the threat that Brazil’s indigenous people are facing from the novel coronavirus pandemic that has spread to their vulnerable communities, infected thousands and killed hundreds. 
Aritana, 71, was rushed to a Goiânia hospital two weeks ago in a risky 9-hour drive from the western state of Mato Grosso, breathing with the aid of oxygen tanks so that he could get to an intensive care unit. He died at the hospital from lung complications caused by the disease. 
His doctor Celso Correia Batista, who serves the indigenous people in the Xingu region, first drove Aritana 10 hours to the small Mato Grosso town of Canarana, where his lung condition deteriorated. 
With no ICU and unable to find a doctor willing to transport Aritana by air, Batista decided to drive on to Goiânia. 
One of the most traditional indigenous leaders in Central Brazil, Aritana led the people of the Upper Xingu and was one of the last speakers of the language of his tribe, Yawalapiti. 
Aritana worked with the Villas-Bôas brothers to create the Xingu National Park, the first vast protected indigenous area in the Amazon where 16 tribes live. 
According to Brazil’s largest indigenous umbrella organization APIB, 631 indigenous people have died from COVID-19 and there have been 22,325 confirmed cases in the community so far. 
The Ministry of Health reports a smaller number of 294 deaths among indigenous people and 16,509 confirmed cases, because it does not count indigenous people who have left their lands and moved to urban areas. 
Half of Brazil’s 300 indigenous tribes have confirmed infections.

A slew of generic drug manufacturers including Cipla Ltd , Sun Pharma and Hetero Labs have been developing favipiravir after India approved it as an as emergency treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19. 
Indian hospitals have suffered a shortage of critical COVID-19 drugs such as remdesivir in recent weeks, but the bottlenecks are expected to ease soon as manufacturers ramp up production. 
Favipiravir has shown promise in clinical trials in India and Russia, but faces uncertain prospects in Japan, where it was originally developed by Fujifilm Holdings, after disappointing clinical studies. 
Lupin’s version of the drug, called Covihalt, will be priced at 49 rupees (65 cents) per 200 mg-tablet, it said. Sun Pharma on Tuesday launched its own version, at 35 rupees, so far the cheapest in India.

The need to run separate and different systems in different jurisdictions is a long-standing complaint of banks and asset managers, particularly in Asia where many operate in several markets. 
This fragmentation has been thrown into sharp relief by the COVID-19 pandemic as it could limit banks ability to lend to companies in countries hard hit by the virus, said the Asia Securities and Financial Markets Association, which represents some of the world’s largest banks and asset managers. 
Global economic losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic are expected to run to trillions of dollars. 
“Before the pandemic, there was an arms race between jurisdictions to ringfence capital in their markets,” said Matthew Chan, an author of the report, which cites regulation in India and Singapore as examples. 
Regulators typically imposed these rules after the global financial crisis requiring banks to keep certain levels of funds within markets so failing institutions could be more easily managed, but the report says this has consequences. 
“As governments reduce economic support there will be a requirement for banks to lend, but if international firms can’t deploy capital across borders because they must hold it in one market, you might see more fragility in the international economic system,” said Chan. 
The report said regulators’ responses to the crisis had also caused some fragmentation as they adopted different rules - for example about short selling and handling of documents - making life difficult for bankers working remotely and sometimes across borders. 
However, it welcomed the decision by standard setting bodies to collectively delay implementation of some other major global regulatory initiatives. (Reporting by Alun John; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)"

Confronting its most lethal outbreak since the Spanish flu a century ago, Brazil reported its first cases of the novel coronavirus at the end of February. The virus took three months to kill 50,000 people, and just 50 days to kill the next 50,000. 
Led by President Jair Bolsonaro, who has played down the gravity of the epidemic and fought lockdowns by local officials, Brazilians who protested nightly from their windows in the first months of the outbreak have met the grim milestone with a shrug. 
“We should be living in despair, because this is a tragedy like a world war. But Brazil is under collective anesthesia,” said Dr. José Davi Urbaez, a senior member of the Infectious Diseases Society. 
He and other pubic health experts have raised the alarm that Brazil still has no coordinated plan to fight the pandemic, as many officials focus on “reopening,” which is likely to boost circulation and worsen the outbreak. 
Two health ministers, both trained doctors, have resigned over differences with Bolsonaro. The acting minister is an army general who has abandoned the call for social distancing, which experts says is essential but the president opposes. 
Bolsonaro, who has called COVID-19 a “little flu,” says he recovered from his own infection thanks to hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that remains unproven against the coronavirus. 
“We don’t know where it will stop, maybe at 150,000 or 200,000 deaths. Only time will show the full impact of COVID-19 here,” said Alexandre Naime, head of the Sao Paulo State University’s department of infectious diseases. 
He said the only comparison may be diseases brought by colonizers, such as smallpox, that decimated indigenous populations when Europeans first arrived in the Americas. 
While that history is long past, Urbaez said Brazil today seems equally resigned to the COVID-19 deaths to come. 
“The government’s message today is: ‘Catch your coronavirus and if it’s serious, there is intensive care.’ That sums up our policy today,” Urbaez said.

Anchorage city officials this week sued to halt indoor dining service at one eatery, Kriner’s Diner, that defied an emergency order issued on July 31 prohibiting the practice after coronavirus infections jumped sharply. 
On Friday, following two days of court hearings, state Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth sided with city officials and issued a temporary restraining order against the restaurant. 
“The restrictions on indoor restaurant dining are undeniably difficult for affected businesses, but they are medically necessary for the health of our entire community,” the municipality had said in its motion. 
The diner’s defiance won them hundreds of supporters. Customers packed the restaurant for days, rallied outside the eatery and distributed “We Support Kriner’s Diner” bumper stickers. 
“We have so much support we are absolutely blown away and we feel your love!” the diner said in a Facebook post on Thursday. 
A handful of other restaurants followed Kriner’s example, and the city has sued a second diner. 
The spread of COVID-19 in Alaska, which seemed to be in check, surged in midsummer. Anchorage, home to about 40 percent of Alaskans, now accounts for more than half of the state’s 4,200-plus confirmed cases. 
Nearly 86% of Anchorage’s hospital beds were occupied as of Friday, state data showed, and city officials say medical services are on the brink of being overwhelmed. Anchorage hospitals serve patients from across the state. 
Tourism to Alaska remains hard hit. The first and only Alaska cruise ship of the season was forced to return to its port in Juneau, the state capital, earlier this week because a passenger came down with COVID-19.

St Johnstone confirmed the postponement on the club’s website. 
“The club is disappointed at the news of this postponement but the health and wellbeing of everybody is of paramount importance in this situation,” a statement said. 
It is a blow for the Scottish Premiership which kicked off the new season last week, having had last season curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Speaking ahead of Friday’s meeting, Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said the positive tests at Aberdeen were “deeply disturbing”.

The ministry said new cases had risen to 1,453 as of Aug. 6, a new daily high since the start of epidemic. Ukraine reported 1,318 cases on Aug. 5 and 1,271 on Aug. 4. It also reported an increase in the death toll. 
“The numbers are impressive and every day we set records. We have increasing numbers of complex cases, numbers of deaths. What numbers do we need to reach in order to think about compliance with the rules?” health minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing. 
He said the total number of infections had reached 78,261, including 1,852 deaths and 43,055 recoveries. Most cases were recorded in western Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv. 
Ukraine imposed tough restrictions in March, halting transport, closing cafes and restaurants and banning public events, but eased the curbs in May to allow the economy to recover from a lockdown-induced recession.

The team announced Aug. 2 that Pederson had tested positive, though the coach was initially asymptomatic. NFL rules require people who test positive and are asymptomatic to quarantine for 10 days or to test negative twice in a five-day span. 
“I was ready to be back here and on the grass with the players,” Pederson said Wednesday. 
Assistant coach Duce Staley acted as head coach during Pederson’s absence. Pederson said he later had minor symptoms, but he was able to run team meetings remotely, while Staley directed things at the team’s facility. 
Pederson said he has no catch-up period given the team hasn’t been on the field besides the allowed “acclimation period.” 
He viewed workouts from home and was able to guide the team remotely. He said the entire offense and defense was installed in the past two weeks thanks to time with players virtually. 
“(Thursday) would have been our first preseason game. We’ve got everything that we need in if we were to play a game tomorrow,” Pederson said. 
With Week 1 about one month away, Pederson said getting players in pads next week and learning about his new players will be critical over the next four weeks. 
Pederson is one of three NFL head coaches known to have tested positive. New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton revealed his diagnosis in March, while HBO’s “Hard Knocks” showed Los Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn telling his players recently that he had tested positive earlier this summer. 
Pederson is entering his fifth season as head coach in Philadelphia. He is 38-26 through four seasons, making the playoffs the past three years, including a Super Bowl victory in the 2017 season.

Lynn, 51, is the third coach in the National Football League (NFL) known to have been infected with the novel coronavirus after the New Orleans Saints’ Sean Payton and Philadelphia Eagles’ Doug Pederson. 
“This year is not like any year we’ve ever had in the NFL,” Lynn said during the opening scene of HBO’s ‘Hard Knocks: Los Angeles’ docuseries. “I can’t promise you you’re not going to get infected. I got infected.” 
Lynn, who is entering his fourth season with the Chargers, said he decided to get tested after seeing a golfer withdraw from a competition due to similar symptoms. 
“If I hadn’t been watching that golf event and saw that golfer complain about back aches and soreness, I never would’ve gotten tested,” he said. 
“I would’ve had this and never even known it.”

An agreement signed between British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the biotechnology company mAbxience of the INSUD Group includes transfer of technology to initially produce 150 million doses of the vaccine to supply all of Latin America with the exception of Brazil, the Argentine government said. 
“Latin American production will be handled in Argentina and Mexico and that will allow timely and efficient access for all countries in the region,” Fernandez said. 
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said later on Twitter that the deal had been pushed by Fernandez and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He said output of the vaccine could extend to 250 million doses. 
AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drugmaker, has long operations in Argentina. The company signed a deal with the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim for production of the vaccine, which is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2021, pending Phase III studies and regulatory approvals. 
Mexico would provide more details on the agreement on Thursday, said Ebrard, who thanked the Slim foundation for financing production. 
Fernandez said the deal “gives Argentina the peace of mind of being able to have the vaccine when required and at a reasonable price.” 
Argentina, which has passed 5,000 coronavirus fatalities, posted a record daily number of COVID-19 infections on Wednesday with 7,663 new cases. There were more than 200 fatalities over the previous 24-hour period. 
“This will provide great relief in the future, but it is not a solution for the present,” added Fernandez, pointing to the growing numbers of infections and fatalities.

Russia said on Tuesday it had granted approval to the vaccine after less than two months of human testing although it had not yet completed final trials, a move that prompted expressions of caution as well as interest worldwide. 
Only about 10% of clinical trials are successful. 
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, told Cuban state news agency Prensa Latina that Cuba could be one of the places it could choose to produce the vaccine from November onwards given its strong biopharmaceutical sector. 
Duran did not comment on this possibility at Cuba’s daily coronavirus briefing, when asked about the Russian vaccine, talking instead more generally about the likelihood of any vaccine. 
“I continue to think that a vaccine will be available to the world and us as part of it from 2021, during 2021, likely in the first months,” Duran said, noting a roundtable on state television would elaborate further on the topic. 
“There are people who say that sometimes I’m a bit pessimistic, but it’s not that I am pessimistic, but you have to be realistic.” 
Cuba, which prides itself on its biopharmaceutical sector developed despite obstacles posed by the U.S. trade embargo, is also researching a possible vaccine. 
The head of Cuba’s state-run biopharmaceutical corporation BioCubaFarma, Eduardo Martínez Díaz, said on Monday scientists were advancing fast in their research.

The case also provides an insider account of the dysfunction critics say paralyzed the Department of Health and Human Services at the dawn of the COVID-19 response. 
The complaint by Dr. Rick Bright, who headed a federal agency called the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, until April 20, says HHS Secretary Alex Azar and his top aides dismissed experts’ warnings about the impending epidemic, failed to implement vital procedures and got sidetracked with political backbiting. 
Bright’s complaint, filed Tuesday, was the subject of media reports for its description of the administration’s scramble to make malaria drugs available at President Trump’s behest. However, the complaint also offers fresh details that haven’t been highlighted. They show how tensions between public health agencies likely delayed a more aggressive early government response. 
When Bright pushed top management in late January to move aggressively, the complaint said, HHS leaders “responded with surprise at Dr. Bright’s dire predictions and urgency, and asserted that the United States would be able to contain the virus and keep it out of the United States.” 
As Reuters reported last month, Azar in January tapped a 37-year-old political appointee with minimal public health or administrative experience to coordinate the agency’s day-to-day response to COVID-19. For six years before joining the Trump Administration, the aide, Brian Harrison, had been a professional labradoodle breeder. 
To read the earlier Reuters report, click reut.rs/2VtT2aA
The whistleblower complaint asserts Harrison and Deputy Chief of Staff Judy Stecker blocked Bright, the government’s top vaccine expert, from key HHS meetings in January. “The decision to eliminate BARDA was made by Brian Harrison, Secretary Azar’s Chief of Staff, and Ms. Stecker,” the complaint said. 
BARDA and Stecker referred calls to HHS, which declined comment. Bright, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. The HHS declined to arrange interviews with Azar and Harrison. 
In an email to a colleague in January, Bright wondered why his group was left out but noted that other health agencies were involved, so his was an “obvious group to cut if shrinking the table. But we have a significant role.” 
In his whistleblower complaint, he said it became clear to him why he was pushed aside. “It was obvious that Dr. Bright’s persistent demands for urgent action to respond to the pandemic had caused a ‘shit storm’ and a ‘commotion’ and were unwelcome in the office of the HHS Secretary,” he wrote. “As a result, HHS leadership excluded Dr. Bright and BARDA from these recurring meetings and from the critical discussions about addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
As Reuters earlier reported, three government sources said Harrison had also blocked the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Stephen Hahn, from a White House task force set up in January to address the public health crisis. 
Three sources say Harrison, who held previous government posts before owning the dog breeding business, kept a “white noise” machine outside his office door to prevent others from hearing his conversations. The agency earlier told Reuters the device was installed by the HHS Office of National Security. HHS also said Harrison was not the person who initially excluded the FDA commissioner, without saying who did. 
Azar earlier told Reuters Harrison has a “deep appreciation for HHS’s complex work.” Others say a chief of staff does not necessarily need healthcare expertise. “There are two important things about chiefs of staff,” said former HHS official William Pierce. “One, you trust them and, two, they make the trains run on time.” 
DELAYED DISASTER PLAN 
In his complaint, Bright also asserts the federal government didn’t initiate a key disaster procedure until the fourth week of January. The Disaster Leadership Group brought together management of key agencies. When he suggested implementing the group earlier, on January 18, Bright said his supervisor, Robert Kadlec, first said it wasn’t necessary and then that there wasn’t “urgency.” Kadlec referred questions to the HHS, which declined comment. 
The complaint also recounts a frustrating attempt to get samples of the actual virus from China, which Bright says “were critical to begin development of vaccines, diagnostics, and medicines.” He said he pushed HHS officials on January 10, 21 and 23 “to obtain sequencing and virus samples from China, to no avail.” On January 27, as Azar was scheduled to talk with China’s health minister, Bright unsuccessfully pressed again. 
The complaint said his team “feverishly emailed health officials and laboratories in Australia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and France to try to obtain samples because the CDC had refused to provide information or virus samples to them.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to HHS, which had no comment. 
Bright, whose lawyers filed the complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is expected to testify about his allegations next week to Congress.

The idea of Dutch artist Dre Wapenaar, the tree tents double as an art installation and are considered sculpture, rather than a commercially-produced tent. 
“The tents are fully booked every summer, but this year, the bookings went much faster. If we had more tents, they would also be taken every day of July and August,” said Katrien Houbey, head of tourism for the eastern town of Borgloon, which has hosted four tents along a tree-lined field since 2011. 
“I believe it’s because of the government’s guidelines to travel in your own country. So people started searching for alternatives to stay somewhere,” she said. 
At 70 euros ($79) a night, the tents sleep two people and include access to a bathroom and barbecue. 
Designed in the 1990s to support environmental activists who sought to stop trees being felled, the tree tents have been exhibited in New York and across Europe. 
“My tents are too expensive to produce (commercially),” Wapenaar told Reuters. “I should have designed it in a different way if I wanted to sell many of them ... I am not a good product designer, I am an artist.” 
Wapenaar has another four tents in the Belgian town of Bornem, near Antwerp, one in a sculpture park in the United States, another at a bed-and-breakfast in France and three at a camp site in the Netherlands.

So far, five medicines have seen their commercial launches delayed by manufacturers until later in the year or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Here are the drugs that have been delayed: 
PALFORZIA 
Aimmune Therapeutics Inc (AIMT.O) paused the launch of the first peanut allergy treatment to be approved by U.S. regulators until later this year because of the widespread closure of allergists’ practices. It is the company’s only approved product, meaning Aimmune is unlikely to make the $48 million in annual revenue some analysts had previously projected. 
ONGENTYS 
Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O) has delayed the launch of its Parkinson’s treatment, which analysts expected to generate nearly $9 million in its first year, until later this year, in part because it said neurologists had been busy helping treat COVID-19 patients. 
XIAFLEX 
Endo International PLC (ENDP.O) has delayed the launch of its drug Xiaflex as a cellulose treatment until later in 2020, even though the FDA is due to give a formal verdict on its approval in July. Xiaflex earned $89 million in the first quarter of 2020 for use in other conditions, such as painful erections. Endo executives told Reuters they expect to see a surge of patients starting new prescription drugs once social distancing measures lift. 
SARCLISA 
Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) launched its multiple myeloma treatment, Sarclisa, in March, but then paused the ramp up and delayed full commercialization until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Analysts projected the drug would earn $173 million in its first year. 
ZEPOSIA 
This treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis was approved late March and was expected by some analysts to earn as much as $91 million in 2020. Bristol Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) delayed the product, citing a slowdown in new drug starts in the early days of the pandemic, but it moved forward with the launch in June because “physicians are beginning to actively initiate new therapies,” said chief commercial officer Christopher Boerner during a recent investor call.

* Over-reliance on a vaccine is not wise, says expert 
* COVID-19 vaccines may need to be given regularly 
* Vaccines should try to “improve on nature” -microbiologist 
By Kate Kelland 
LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Emerging evidence that the body’s immune defence against COVID-19 may be short-lived makes it even harder for vaccine developers to come up with shots fully able to protect people in future waves of infection, scientists said on Tuesday. 
Preliminary studies in China, Germany, Britain and elsewhere have found that patients infected with the novel coronavirus make protective antibodies as part of their immune system’s defences, but these appear to last only a few months. 
“Most people make them (antibodies), but often they can wane rather rapidly, suggesting there could be little immunity,” said Daniel Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. 
That raises big problems for developers of potential COVID-19 vaccines, experts say - and for public health authorities seeking to deploy them to protect populations from future waves of the pandemic. 
“It does mean that the over-reliance on a vaccine (to control the pandemic) is not wise,” said Stephen Griffin, a Leeds University associate professor of medicine. 
To be truly effective, COVID-19 vaccines “will either need to generate stronger and longer lasting protection ... or they may need to be given regularly”, he said. 
“And those things are not trivial.” 
More than 100 research teams and companies around the world are seeking to develop vaccines against COVID-19, and at least 17 are already in human trials to test efficacy. 
A preclinical trial in pigs of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, known as AZD1222, showed that two doses produced a greater antibody response than a single dose. 
So far, however, there is no data from any human trials showing whether any protective antibody immune response would be strong- and long-lasting enough. 
BOOSTER SHOTS 
Jeffrey Arnold, a visiting professor of microbiology at Britain’s Oxford University and a former expert at Sanofi Pasteur, said one reason for the lack of data is simply time: 
The high-speed development and testing of potential coronavirus vaccines has been underway for barely six months - not long enough to show longevity of any protection they offer. 
He and other vaccine and immunology experts also said it does not necessarily follow that waning immunity in natural cases of COVID-19 infection would be the same with vaccine-induced immune response: 
“If we can, we’d want to improve on nature,” he said in a telephone interview. “With vaccines, of course, we’re not infecting with the virus directly, but we’re presenting the surface protein delivered by a different vector, or made in the laboratory and injected into the arm ... so the ideal goal is to do better than infection itself by making the vaccine immunity even stronger than the natural one.” 
Griffin said one approach could be that when viable vaccines are developed, authorities should reckon with getting booster shots to millions of people at regular intervals, or even combining two or more types of vaccine in each person to elicit the best possible protection. 
Practically, however, that presents a vast challenge. “Giving the entire world even one dose of a vaccine is one thing,” he said. “Giving them multiple doses is quite another.” (Reporting by Kate Kelland, Editing by William Maclean)"

Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel have been seen mixing with people outside their individual team groups. 
Leclerc returned to his Monaco home after finishing second in last Sunday’s Austrian Grand Prix while Vettel was shown on television talking to Red Bull bosses, without face masks, in the Red Bull Ring paddock. 
“Ferrari have been issued with a reminder and warned that any further breaches of the COVID-19 code could be referred to the stewards,” said an FIA spokesman. 
He added that the warning was about respecting the group system and need for social distancing rather than Leclerc’s travel movements. 
The FIA’s COVID-19 code states that any time spent outside the closed venue “must be spent with other members of the same group, keeping interaction with persons outside that group to a minimum.” 
Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas, who won last Sunday, also went home to Monaco after the opening race but remained within his ‘bubble’ by seeing only those within his existing group his girlfriend and trainer. 
Some team bosses also left the Red Bull ring, including McLaren’s Zak Brown. 
“We have rules of engagement for the senior members of the team... at the same time, that was planned from the beginning,” McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl said of Brown’s absence. 
“Zak had to fly back for business reasons but he was following all the necessary measures which are in place in terms of social distancing and isolating himself... I don’t see any safety risk.”

“There are unknown effects it has on lung capacity, unknown effects it has on cardiac health,” one general manager of a team entering the NBA bubble told ESPN on the condition of anonymity. 
“What if a 24-year-old catches it in Orlando and, in 14 days, he quarantines and is fine, but then he has these everlasting heart problems? (Or he) gets winded so easily, or he becomes a little bit too susceptible to fatigue? ... These are all the unknowns.” 
The NBA is preparing to restart the season, with 22 teams reporting this week to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando for training camp. Games are scheduled to resume on July 30. 
Any player who tests positive faces a two-week quarantine period before he can be cleared to return to the court. A physician will determine when the isolation period is over, a process that will include a cardiac screening. 
Matthew Martinez, a consulting cardiologist for the NBA Players Association, stressed to ESPN that players will need time to rest after a positive test because doctors believe “the amount of cardiac damage can increase if you continue to exercise in the face of an active infection.” 
The effects of COVID-19 on cardiac health, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), are “not yet fully understood,” the league wrote in a memo sent to teams on June 15, per ESPN. 
According to the American College of Cardiology’s Sports and Exercise Cardiology Council, “Acute cardiac injury ... occur(s) in up to 22 percent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which is significantly higher compared with the approximately 1 percent prevalence in non-COVID-19 acute viral infections.” 
Myocarditis “could result in cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, and death,” the council said. 
John DiFiori, the NBA’s director of sports medicine, told ESPN he would urge any player who is diagnosed with the coronavirus to follow a physician’s advice for managing the illness. 
“If you don’t feel well, don’t try to push through this,” Fiori said. “This is not a situation where anyone, whether you’re an athlete or not, should try to push through or minimize symptoms or try to ignore symptoms and try to push through to try to continue to work or continue to play a sport.”
