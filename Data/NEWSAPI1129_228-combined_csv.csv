Microsoft's Bing team has built a tracker for COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, located at www.bing.com/covid. 
The site, launched Sunday, features a live map and tracks total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as cases per country. Click on a country and you'll get more information about the virus outbreak there, with numbers of active/recovered/fatal cases, as well as news and videos. For the U.S., you'll also get a breakdown of confirmed cases per state. 
The site doesn't offer anything significantly different from similar trackers we've seen Johns Hopkins university's live map is still one of the best resources out there but it's fast, clean and mobile friendly. Also, the ""News"" tab for individual countries currently doesn't show anything.

The site was a team effort from Microsoft Bing employees working from home, and the data comes from sources such as the the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
On Monday, Alphabet's Verily launched a coronavirus screening website for the Santa Clara and San Mateo counties in California. Verily is a ""sister company"" to Google (both companies are subsidiaries of Alphabet) that's focused on life sciences and healthcare. 
Verily's coronavirus screening website is currently limited to two counties in California.

The launch follows remarks from President Donald Trump that Google is building a coronavirus test site, which seemed to have caught Google by surprise. 
The website is an ""online screener based on guidelines from public health officials,"" which will help people learn whether they qualify for testing through Verily's program. And while the site is currently very limited in scope, Verily says it's ""working to rapidly expand testing.""
""The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsoms office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks,"" Verily said in a blog post on its website.
To be eligible for the screener, users must be U.S. residents aged 18 or older, with a Google Account, and they must be willing to share health information with Google. 
The coronavirus has so far killed more than 6,500 and infected more than 169,661 people. The outbreak has been worsening in the U.S. in recent weeks, with more than 3,400 confirmed cases and 65 deaths."

As you keep up to date on the latest updates concerning the novel coronavirus, which the World Health Organization has now declared a pandemic, this simple advice stands. 
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention already has useful tips on how to wash your hands, which you should be diligently following, alongside the World Health Organization's advice for the public. 
Online, though, some people have shared their own advice. And even if you already consider yourself a handwashing expert, there's something for everyone in these fun tips going around, amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus.
For kids: 
Shared by ABC News, this six-year-old explains the handwashing advice that he learned from his doctor as a coronavirus prevention tactic. 
For each stage of the handwashing cycle, he shares some kid-friendly techniques.
For families: 
Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the TODAY Show, shared a video on her Instagram of her and her daughter singing and dancing to a made-up song that Guthrie hopes, per her caption, can help in ""making corona less scary for little ones."" 
Sample lyrics? ""We do a little dance, and we scrub our little hands. We get soap under our nails. What's it called? The corona shuffle!""

For Sailor Moon fans: 
In addition to hand washing advice, this Sailor Moon themed graphic, created by Instagram user @marcoalbieroart, breaks down all the basics for fighting coronavirus. 
For teachers: 
Good Morning America reported that a teacher in Missouri designed a simple hack to check whether or not kids have been washing their hands thoroughly enough, which she shared on Facebook: In the morning, she stamped their hands. If the stamp was gone by the end of the day, after careful handwashing, students got a prize. 
To Good Morning America, the teacher, Shauna Woods, spoke about the success of her tactic: ""Let's be honest, some student's biggest worry is if they'll get to recess on time. Providing a visual reminder and incentive has boosted their hygiene regiment. I even joined in on the fun and put a stamp on my hand to be their positive role model."" 
For lullaby lovers: 
In addition to using that viral handwashing generator, you can add another musical addition to your handwashing repertoire: Instagram user @lucyknisley shared a handwashing song to be sung to the tune of Frère Jacques. (And you can download a printable poster of the song here.) 
At the end of the day, the message is clear: Just wash your hands."

The video-sharing app is home to everything from viral anthems about being bored in the house (and in the house, bored) to quarantine-friendly workouts. 
Now, TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet company, ByteDance, is taking it a big step further with a big contribution to relief efforts aimed at the unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19. 
In a statement published on the social media company's website on April 9, TikTok President Alex Zhu announced that the company would donate $375 million to COVID-19 relief efforts. 
""The TikTok community is uplifting one another, caring for one another, and lending a hand to one another,"" Zhu said in the statement. ""We want to magnify all we are seeing across our community and translate it into concrete relief for those most affected by this crisis."" 
The majority of the company's contribution, $250 million, will be going to front-line medical workers, educational efforts, and community relief programs. 
Of that, $150 million will go to ""medical staffing, supplies, and hardship relief for health care workers,"" including a partnership with the CDC Foundation to contribute $15 million for surge staffing within local response efforts. TikTok says $40 million will go to local organizations that reflect TikTok's ""user communities,"" which includes ""musicians, artists, nurses, educators, and families,"" according to the statement. 
The donations will be spread globally, but will be given primarily to local organizations such as After-School All-Stars and MusiCares in the U.S., according to a statement from a TikTok spokesperson we received via email.
""In an emergency, speed saves lives, and we are extremely grateful to TikTok for stepping forward to support surge staffing that is needed to meet rapidly emerging demands identified by state and local health departments,"" Judy Monroe, president and CEO of the CDC Foundation, said, according to the statement.
An additional $10 million will be allotted for matching TikTok user donations, while another $50 million will support the ""TikTok Creative Learning Fund,"" through grants to educators, professional experts, and nonprofits focused on distance-learning.  
The company is also donating $100 million in ad credits to small and media-sized businesses ""to help companies get back on their feet once economies are able to restart normal activity,"" per Zhu's statement. (Pending the decisions of public health authorities on restarting business operations, the program will start its rollout in the coming months.)

Additionally, TikTok is providing $25 million ""in prominent in-feed ad space"" for NGOs, trusted health sources, and local authorities in order to allow them an avenue for informing the public on the importance of safety measures like social distancing. 
This has some precedent: Previously, the social media company partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to combat misinformation swirling around COVID-19. TikTok also donated $10 million to the WHO Solidarity Response Fund.
The TikTok spokesperson told Mashable that the company will be sharing ""many more"" details about the donations in the coming weeks."

Now the corporate jargon is coming for RollerCoaster Tycoon, too. 
Twitter user Chris Goodwin wrote up a statement from his fictional RollerCoaster Tycoon park, which assured park goers that while the park would stay open, the staff would live up to its two-time win of the Tidiest Park Award. 
SEE ALSO: Park rangers are still exposed as coronavirus spreads
""We are temporarily suspending the $5 admission fee to use our restroom facilities,"" Goodwin wrote, joking about the notorious game strategy to up park profits by decreasing attendee happiness. ""We hope that customers will use the free bathroom to wash their hands regularly throughout their stay at our park."" 
Other ""safety measures"" include adding disinfectant to the water in the log flume ride, seating every other car in the ferris wheel, and taking the ""necessary action of picking up and drowning any park patrons who show signs"" of symptoms. 
""We will also keep the rollercoaster that shoots straight up open, so that if customers wish to die at our park they can do so of their own volition,"" the statement continues. 
On the plus side, the park's food stands will provide students with a free ice cream cone to offset the financial stress for families that need to feed their children during school hours only with a valid student ID, of course. 
""We will be offering a 75 percent refund on already purchased tickets if you no longer feel comfortable joining us at the park,"" the statement concluded. 
And after all of those generous measures, who wouldn't want to visit? 
Goodwin's precautions may be harsh, but considering an Equinox employee recently tested positive for COVID-19 and the gym still isn't shutting down its nationwide locations, the fictional amusement park might be doing something right!"

She had beaten the novel coronavirus but she couldn't get dressed by herself or even raise her arms to brush her hair.
""By the grace of God I was able to get off (the ventilator),"" said the 69-year-old woman from Lorain, Ohio.
Villareal is among thousands of people who have survived after contracting Covid-19. As of Thursday, estimates indicate that more than 710,000 people have recovered from Covid-19 worldwide, according to data collected by John Hopkins University. The actual figure is likely to be higher because the data cover only confirmed cases.
The survivors are old and young, celebrities, health care workers, faith leaders and parents. They battled the virus while hospitalized or isolated at home and were able to make it through.
Here's what people on the other side of the pandemic are doing:
They are learning how to breathe and walk again
Jesse Vanderhoof could barely move with a walker around his home in Blaine County, Idaho, and going to his upstairs bedroom was out of the question.
For the 40-year-old nurse, the skiing and hiking trips with his wife feel like distant memories. Ten days after leaving the hospital, walking only a couple of blocks leaves him extremely exhausted. 
""You want to talk about humbling and challenging for a man, that's as tough as it gets right there,"" Vanderhoof said of his week on a ventilator after he contracted coronavirus while working on Covid-19 testing tents.
Vanderhoof's wife, Emily, said she's slept on the floor while he slept on the couch to help him walk to the bathroom at night and has seen him battle the ""ICU delirium,"" an acute brain condition particularly common in patients who are sedated and on a ventilator for extended periods of time.
""He didn't understand why the world was at war with (Covid-19), why health care workers were heroes, why he was involved,"" Emily, 34, said. ""We had the same conversation for four days straight.""
Some survivors, such as David Lat, say one of their biggest challenges has been learning ""how to breathe again"" after spending 17 days in a New York hospital and six days on a ventilator. 
""It's not happily ever after, but it's better than the alternative,"" the lawyer and founder of the blog ""Above the Law"" told CNN.
The ventilator may have caused some damage to his vocal chords, Lat says, noting his hoarse voice, but ""I wouldn't be here without it.""
Leah Blomberg's muscles are weak after being in a medically-induced coma and on a ventilator for nine days. She says she feels lucky to be alive, but what used to be a 15-minute shower now takes her 45 minutes.
""The recovery is probably the worst,"" Blomberg said. ""Basically it's having to learn to walk again, because your muscles ... it's like you've never used them before.""
For those who were not hospitalized, the recovery at home can vary. Some say the process is not immediate and it has taken them weeks to recover their stamina, while others say it takes from days to weeks to get past the fever.
They are reuniting with their families 
When Sandra Sandoli embraced her husband and daughters, it was a hug like no other. It was their own Easter Sunday miracle.
""I cried. It was a hug of relief and happiness but also of sadness for all we are all going through now. So many emotions at once,"" said Sandoli, 52, a retired teacher in Fair Haven, New Jersey. 
For more than a month, Sandoli was quarantined in her bedroom after falling ill while visiting her parents in Delaware and testing positive for Covid-19. She couldn't see her parents, who contracted the virus through her, or comfort her two daughters who flew home from college.
They would leave her meals and tea by the door and pick up the empty dishes, wearing a mask and gloves, by the end of the day. They'd talk over the phone with her or while standing in different rooms.
Sandoli overcame the fever and regained her strength but a lingering cough worried her. Afraid of the virus and unable to get tested again, Sandoli said she and her doctor decided she would wait indefinitely until the cough was gone.
Sandoli left her bedroom Sunday and reunited with her family. They walked side by side for a few miles.
""It felt a little surreal,"" she said. ""The simplest thing like taking a walk was the biggest deal.""
They cooked and sat together at their dinner table eating fish, mashed potatoes and vegetables. They took a Zumba class online together.
""When I hugged my daughters, I didn't want it to end. I will never take those hugs for granted,"" Sandoli added. ""We made it.""
They are actively helping others 
Nicole Chayet and her husband have been knocking on stranger's doors around New York and bringing them bags full of groceries and essentials for the past week. 
""I want to help others. I survived the virus and I feel strong,"" Chayet, 33, told CNN. ""I'm not afraid of going outside to help other people.""
When Chayet, director of media relations for the New York City Football Club, and her husband were ill, she said she was afraid of telling other people or even asking others to take care of their 22-month-old daughter while they recovered.
Now, they are splitting their time between working from home, connecting with people suffering from coronavirus or their relatives, and trying to help others.
Earlier this week, Chayet gave a blood sample to a study conducted by Mount Sinai Hospital, aiming to use antibodies to treat coronavirus patients. She said she wants to volunteer in more studies and has since received messages from people in states as far away as Arizona and California asking whether she could find a way to help their loved ones.
Other survivors are mobilizing, donating blood or planning to help as soon as they make a full recovery.
Diana Berrent, a photographer in Port Washington, New York, who recovered from Covid-19, created Survivor Corps, a Facebook group aimed at helping people post and find research and donation opportunities for survivors. The group now has more than 30,000 members. 
""I'd like to think of it as a superhero -- me and all the other survivors have these internally-built hazmat suits,"" Berrent told CNN.
Even Vanderhoof, the nurse in Idaho who is still slowly trying to regain his stamina, is looking forward to getting back to work -- even if he doesn't know when that would be possible.
""If I've learned anything in this experience with medical problems, it's that I want to help people more than I ever have before,"" Vanderhoof said. 
What has been one of his most vulnerable times has become motivation for Vanderhoof to keep living and ultimately defend others from the pandemic.
CNN's Eric Levenson, Paul Vercammen, Hollie Silverman and Holly Yan contributed to this report."

They demonstrated how the site would work on a handy flow chart. 
But if there's anything to take away from the internet, it's that holding up paper makes for prime meme material. The kind folks at Full Frontal made it even easier, posting a blank version of the meme format.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)After 50,000 Covid-19 deaths, enormous job losses and and more than a month under lockdown, stunned Americans are looking for signs of hope. And President Donald Trump has been trying to provide them. 
But Trump's evening briefings at the White House have instead produced a string of uncomfortable collisions between politics and science -- not least his suggestion Thursday that injecting disinfectant into the body could potentially kill the virus.
In another of his remarkable comments, the President had earlier touted the benefits of an unproven drug in fighting Covid-19, a fact he downplays now that research has suggested it may not work. The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, had urged caution on the drug, hydroxychloroquine, and another prominent government scientist alleged this week that he was reassigned after refusing to join in promoting its use. 
In New York magazine, Jonathan Chaitwarned that when politics steers science, you can wind up with the grotesque example of the Soviet Union's Trofim Lysenko under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. Real scientists were silenced as the regime empowered Lysenko to dispute the proven laws of genetics, Chait wrote earlier this month. Lysenko even claimed, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, ""that wheat plants raised in the appropriate environment produce seeds of rye, which is equivalent to saying that dogs living in the wild give birth to foxes."" 
""Lysenko genetics"" has long been a laughingstock. Science proceeds on its own terms and timetable; it can't be counted on to provide the solutions public officials desperately want, when they want them.
""For weeks, Trump and Fox News hosts and guests incessantly repeated unproven claims about hydroxychloroquine,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""Trump and everyone else who magnifies the President's most irresponsible exhortations bears guilt in this disaster."" 
At Thursday's briefing, Trump invited a government official to talk about research indicating the virus could be killed by sunlight and humidity, in an apparent effort to vindicate the President's controversial early prediction that the virus might disappear during the summer, which the National Academy of Sciences has questioned. And Trump suggested patients could be treated by the internal use of UV light and disinfectants, an idea that doctors immediately dismissed as ridiculous and dangerous. (On Friday he said his suggestion had been a ""sarcastic question."")
Challenged by reporters, Trump replied, ""I'm just here to present talent. I'm here to present ideas ... If heat is good, if light is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned."" His remarks reinforced Michael D'Antonio's view that ""in this time of pandemic, when unimaginable suffering has befallen our nation, he is essentially channeling not Abraham Lincoln, or Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the long-dead Johnny Carson ... Trump appears to be relying on his showman's instinct and on what he remembers of the TV star who was once his idol,"" he wrote. 
""Trump didn't invent any of this,""Jill Filipovic observed. ""A Republican Party that sowed distrust in science because the reality of climate change was financially inconvenient for fossil fuel companies, and determined that conservative, patriarchal Christian morality should take precedence over public health in how we teach our kids about sex and the human body, is exactly what brought us Trump in the first place,"" Filipovic wrote. 
""More than three years into his presidency,"" argued Garry Kasparov, ""Trump -- facing an unprecedented crisis in the form of a deadly pandemic -- has shown himself to be a dangerous pathogen. Trump has spent his time in office weakening the nation's systemic immune system -- or institutions that hold him in check -- and setting the US up for a disaster when those institutions are needed more than ever."" 
Faulting Trump for the pandemic's deadly sweep across the US is wrong, wrote Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post. ""Trump heeded the advice of our public health experts every step of the way. When Fauci and Deborah Birx recommended that he implement population mitigation measures, he did so -- shutting down a booming US economy to protect public health."" Thiessen asked, ""Why was everyone so slow to see the coming danger? Because at a time when China's government should have been alerting us to prepare for an unprecedented contagion, Chinese officials were spreading disinformation that kept the United States and the world in the dark.""
For Project Syndicate, the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten wrote that despite their failures, Trump's bashing of China and the World Health Organization is unproductive right now. ""To recover from these horrors and their aftermath, we must try to persuade China to work with us, and we must strengthen the institutions that are essential for effective international cooperation.""
Trump's Thursday briefing also featured an appearance by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield attempting a walk-back of his comments in the Washington Post that a fall wave of the disease could be even more difficult because it would coincide with a seasonal flu outbreak. The move backfired, since Redfield acknowledged he was quoted accurately. 
The CDC director is not the only one who fears the future spread of Covid-19 will be even worse. In a sobering interview with Peter Bergen, infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm said the ultimate death toll in the US could be in the range of 800,000, 16 times what it was as of Friday. 
""This first wave of illness is, in fact, just the beginning of what could very easily be 16 to 18 months of substantial activity of this virus around the world, coming and going, wave after wave,"" Osterholm said. The US desperately needs a long-term strategy to fight the virus, a middle way where ""we open our economy and everyday life in a way that is capable of rapidly detecting the emergence of new waves of infection. Then we do whatever we can again with physical distancing to limit the new infection's spread."" 
Trump has encouraged governors and protesters to push for the rapid reopening of America even when such moves violate the guidelines laid down by his own scientific advisers. And Georgia's Gov. Brian Kemp proved eager to respond, ordering that many businesses could reopen Friday. Trump at first welcomed the move, but as criticism grew, he said he was ""not happy with Brian Kemp,"" particularly for allowing spas, nail salons and tattoo parlors to be among those reopening. 
In 1918, a premature reopening by the city of Denver produced a severe outbreak of the deadly influenza, John Avlon pointed out. ""Kemp seems more intent on playing to the base than listening to scientists,"" he wrote. ""He was late to the lockdown and now wants to open up early. But then again, he's the same governor -- of the CDC's home state -- who said it was news to him that asymptomatic people could spread the disease, two months after it was common knowledge."" 
Reopening requires a careful look at the underlying health conditions that make people particularly vulnerable to the disease, wrote Dr. Eric Schulze and Madhu Vijayan. ""Rather than continuing to use a sledgehammer plan to defeat this virus, there may be wisdom in using a scalpel: a targeted approach that shelters the vulnerable and clearly delineates who is not at risk. This could create a path for reentry into normal life in a carefully structured manner."" 
""I am someone whom Covid-19 could easily kill,"" wrote Van Jones, noting that for decades he used ""social justice activism as an excuse to neglect my health ... I ate crappy food, rarely exercised, guzzled diet soda and rarely slept."" Now he struggles with high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and hypertension. 
""This virus is wiping out black people like me in hugely disproportionate numbers.
""If the African American community is going to beat this virus -- and create a pandemic-resistant black community -- we are going to have to make big changes in both our public systems and our personal lives ... Ensuring the health of African Americans means addressing the lack of access (food deserts), racial discrimination in health care and the epidemic of over-incarceration,"" along with lifestyle changes, Jones wrote. 
One of the most promising treatments for Covid-19 appears to be the use of blood plasma from recovered patients, wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. ""Strangest and most miraculous of all, convalescent plasma treatment is cheap -- no drug company, villainous hedge-fund mover and shaker or insurance company is getting a cut. Rather, plasma uses altruistic donors, an existing network of blood banks and routine hospital processes for collection and delivery."" (For a look at its use in one case, read Thomas Lake's column, ""The Distance."")
For more on Covid-19 and its impact: 
A presidential campaign like none other in US history continued to play out, with Trump using the White House briefings to sound his campaign themes and Joe Biden trying to get his message out while raising campaign funds. 
""With less than 200 days until Election Day,"" wrote Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan, ""the Trump campaign has nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on hand to spend raining down negative Biden television and digital ads on key swing states."" 
Ads from Trump and his supporters ""may not only take the lies and misinformation to a new level; they could use the latest in artificial intelligence to manipulate voice and video to make their points."" 
The other big question for Democrats is who Biden will pick as his running mate. He's promised that he will choose a woman to run for vice president. There's one outstanding choice, according to Julian Zelizer: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""She would instantly energize Biden's campaign and expand its capacity to reach a broad electoral base,"" Zelizer wrote. 
David Andelman argued for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: ""Whitmer brings her skills as a governor and public official who has unfailingly seen from the get-go what her state needs in this, its most critical hour, and with laser-like precision has gone after it. With her leadership skills, she has also shown herself prepared to do so for the nation as well."" 
Former NAACP president Ben Jealous has known Stacey Abrams for nearly 30 years and is convinced she's right for the veep role. She ""brings something to politics that is often lacking -- creative approaches to complex challenges, and given the current pandemic crisis we are facing, we need her creative thinking, now more than ever."" 
The nearest grocery store is two hours away. Wildlife photographer Kim Wolhuter and his wife and daughter know about isolation. They live with little outside human interaction on a huge wildlife reserve in Zimbabwe. 
""What we lack in material belongings, bank balances, convenience and community,"" he said in an interview with CNN's Inside Africa, ""we make up for with a deep and real connection to nature, a focus on family time (a lot of it) and a sense of peace that I think the world is missing. We live simply but fully.""
Part of that lifestyle is a closeness to nature and the local population of wild hyenas. Wolhuter said he has a problem with the way ""The Lion King ... totally vilifies hyenas."" He's working on a project ""to change the way we see hyenas so we can protect these incredible creatures and their habitat.""
The family shares some rituals ""that make the experience of isolation particularly enjoyable. One of them is sleeping out under the night sky as much as possible -- but especially when the moon is full. We wake up full of dew, to see the setting of the moon and rising of the sun.""
Asked for advice to the rest of us living in isolation, Wolhuter said: ""In this time of crisis, I ask that you give up technology for that briefest of moments and connect with nature in whatever way you can, even just peering out the window."""

Los Angeles County reported 1,491 new coronavirus cases on Monday, bringing the total to 13,816, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.
At Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, most of the people coming to the emergency room are experiencing respiratory issues.
""What we are seeing is a lot more sicker people now coming in that qualify for an inpatient stay,"" said Dr. Paryus Patel, chief medical officer of Centinela Hospital Medical Center. ""So typically, we used to see on a non-Covid day about 150, 180 patients a day. We are seeing about 90 to 100 (patients) -- averaging out. Most of them come in for an acute medical need which will require hospitalization.""
Patel is also seeing signs that people are loosening their own social distancing measures despite mandates from Garcetti and California Gov. Gavin Newsom for residents to shelter at home.
""After Easter, we got hit hard and that was because families were visiting each other,"" Patel said of Centinela Hospital where he estimates 40% to 45% of patients are Covid-19 infected. ""So they are visiting more patients and families, which they shouldn't be doing and that's why we're going to start seeing more and more.""
He warned that Los Angeles County has not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.
""We still have two to three more weeks to curtail this disease and probably plateau or flatten it out,"" Patel said. The doctor warned that if people don't continue social distancing, California's system of hospitals could be overwhelmed with patients.
Meanwhile at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the hospital has seen its patient volume drop significantly and is now at half capacity. It's Covid-19 patient volume has been stable for two weeks with about 120 to 130 patients fighting the disease. But even with the coronavirus patients, Cedars-Sinai's emergency room is seeing about half the volumes that it normally would.
""Right now, we're taking care of about 400 or so non-Covid patients,"" said Dr. Jeff Smith, chief operating officer of Cedars-Sinai Hospital. ""We're still caring for three- to four-times as many non-Covid patients as we are Covid patients but we still have a lot of capacity because patients have chosen to avoid the hospital.""
Both Centinela Hospital and Cedars-Sinai have separate areas of their facilities dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients and both hospitals want people to seek out medical attention before their health deteriorates.
""It really just comes back to if you have an urgent or an emergent need, we can care for you safely at the hospital,"" said Smith, of Cedars-Sinai. ""And you should come."""

And any other experimental drugs should only be …",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/21/health/nih-covid-19-treatment-guidelines/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200326235359-hydroxychloroquine-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-22T00:53:28Z,"(CNN)Doctors should not use a drug combination strongly pushed by President Donald Trump to treat patients with coronavirus infections, a National Institutes of Health panel says in new guidelines published Tuesday. And any other experimental drugs should only be tried as part of a clinical trial, the panel said.
The guidelines, published online, are meant to guide doctors, nurses and other medical professionals treating patients with Covid-19 and will be updated in real time as more is learned in fighting the pandemic, the NIH said.
Trump has touted an antimalarial drug known as hydroxychloroquine, especially in combination with an antibiotic azithromycin, for treating Covid-19 even though there has been no medical recommendation to use it. Although a few very small studies have suggested it might help patients recover, more and more studies have shown that the drug combination may do little or no good and may increase the rate of other complications.
Asked about the NIH guidance on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin during Tuesday's White House coronavirus task force meeting, President Trump said, ""we'll take a look at that. I'm always willing to take a look.""
The guidelines give details on which drugs should be used, but also when and how to provide extra oxygen to patients struggling to breathe, how to safely use equipment on potentially infectious patients and include what's known about heart, liver and kidney complications in patients.
The panel, made of up experts from the federal government, universities and professional medical societies, notes that no drug has yet been shown to help patients recover from Covid-19. No drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Covid-19.
""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"" one of the recommendations reads.
""If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used, clinicians should monitor the patient for adverse effects,"" it adds -- including an abnormal heart reading.
""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the group adds.
The panel also urges caution in another treatment making headlines: the use of plasma from Covid-19 survivors. ""There are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of COVID-19,"" it said.
Survivors have been clamoring to donate blood in the hope that antibodies produced by their immune systems could help new patients recover from quickly from infection, but no one has finished a clinical trial to show whether the treatment actually helps and if so, how much plasma to use or which antibodies to filter out and administer.
Likewise, the group recommends caution in the use of drugs aimed at tamping down the immune response in patients at risk of cytokine storms, and it warned against using some immune-suppressing drugs such as Janus kinase inhibitors of JAK-inhibitors, often used for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions.
The panel specifically recommends against using the combination of hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin because of potential toxic side-effects, except as part of a clinical trial. It also recommends against a combination of the HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and other HIV drugs that stop viruses from replicating.
Patients can experience septic shock and an immune overreaction known as a cytokine storm, the guidelines say. And several reports show about 20% of critically ill patients suffer an inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue known as myocarditis, as well as heart rhythm dysfunction and other injuries to the heart. Liver and kidney problems are also common among very sick patients, with one report that 15% of patients with critical disease need an intense form of dialysis known as continuous renal replacement therapy.
There are recommendations also for helping the burdened lungs of Covid-19 patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS.
""Currently there is no evidence that ventilator management of patients with ARDS due to Covid-19 should differ from management of patients with viral pneumonia due to influenza or other respiratory viruses,"" the panel said.
Despite a few reports about patients who get a treatment that uses a pump to circulate their blood through an artificial exterior lung, called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, there's not enough evidence to recommend it, the group said
And health workers should be careful to wear the correct protective gear, such as fit-tested N95 respirator masks, when performing certain procedures that can shoot tiny particles of virus-carrying material, known as aerosols, into the air.

The 11-year-old has a rare blood disease called chronic cyclic neutropenia, which causes her white cell count to drop dramatically low every three months.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/us/zoom-panel-kidscovid19-maryland/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200425183136-04-alyssa-jennings-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-26T00:10:19Z,"(CNN)Alyssa Jennings knows what it's like to be isolated, sick and self-quarantined. The 11-year-old has a rare blood disease called chronic cyclic neutropenia, which causes her white cell count to drop dramatically low every three months.
This makes her very susceptible to getting severely sick. She is a regular at Inova Fairfax Children's Hospital, where she has an excellent medical team.
In December, Alyssa spent her Christmas holiday in isolation with Influenza A and B as well as pneumonia. Her mom and grandfather set up a small Christmas tree in her room.
""The first time I got my blood drawn, I cried. I try to think about my dog Hope because she makes me happy,"" Alyssa says. ""Usually when I'm scared, I tell myself it will be all right. I color or paint and do puzzles to get my mind off being in the hospital."" 
Alyssa jokes she almost finished a 200-piece ""Frozen"" puzzle but is still looking for the one missing piece in her room. 
One hospital visit was particularly rough on her mom, Danielle Jennings.
""Once her [Aly's] heart stopped briefly. And it terrified me. We had to check for impacts of oxygen because of it. Those nights I am usually crying and frustrated and have to take a walk and chat with another parent. But Aly took it all in stride.""
Alyssa is in the highest risk group for the coronavirus because of her extremely compromised immune system. Her temperature is checked three times a day, and her doctors call in at least a couple of times a week.
But during the coronavirus pandemic, Alyssa's mind isn't just on herself. She's come up with a novel way using the internet to help her peers cope with their own experiences.
A constant battle against germs
Alyssa lives with Jennings, a government military analyst who is now working from home. She is a sixth-grade honor student in Prince George's County, Maryland. 
Before the arrival of the coronavirus, Alyssa's life looked a lot like everyone else's today. When she arrived home from school, she dropped her backpack, clothes, shoes, keys and all belongings at the front door to be disinfected each night.
Phones, remote controls and door handles were wiped down constantly. 
Alyssa always carries a mask, gloves, hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes in a little purse just in case she's confronted with a cough, sneeze or dirty area.
""Once her heart stopped briefly. And it terrified me. We had to check for impacts of oxygen because of it. Those nights I am usually crying and frustrated and have to take a walk and chat with another parent. But Aly took it all in stride.""
Alyssa often tried to explain to her classmates why she had to take so many precautions, but they often didn't understand.
'They think I'm joking about it'
""They don't really care. They think I'm joking about it,"" says Alyssa. ""Sometimes they cough on me on purpose. The last time that happened, I had to move to the back of the line. I got in trouble with the teacher because I moved out of the line and had to do lunch detention.""
As much as Alyssa's mother tries to arm her daughter with encouragement, Jennings says ""most kids think she's making it up or being 'a little extra,' as they say.""
Now Alyssa's classmates are for the first time experiencing what she has lived with since she can remember the fears around getting sick, confronting the unknown and all the necessary life restrictions to stay healthy.
""I'm beginning to feel they know it's not a game. It's a big deal,"" says Alyssa.
Alyssa wants to talk to other kids about the coronavirus to let them know that many of the things they are unfamiliar with are not cause to panic.
""I feel like some kids are scared. The news scares them, and they become terrified."" Alyssa worries.
So with the help of her mother and adult mentor Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Alyssa's vision was launched Friday through a Zoom panel called ""KidsCovid19.""
Five kids, ranging from 10 to 16, registered with their parents' permission for the Zoom discussion that was broadcast live on Facebook.
""It's important for kids to 'walk it out' as I say, for them to feel they have a voice. Sometimes we are so busy adulting we don't have time to hear what they're saying. And the news is constantly talking about the struggles of adults, the frustration around homeschooling, not what the kids are going through,"" Jennings says.
The children's stories run the gamut. 
A young girl lights up when she describes the fun she's having with her dad doing something completely new -- putting together 400-piece puzzles. Her brothers' wrestling doesn't really bother her the way it used to.
A boy laments ""it's a big bummer"" after waiting eight months to play on the school's soccer team but concedes he likes to kick the ball around with his father after he completes his schoolwork.
Another boy says ""I'm kind-of sad because Covid is stopping everything,"" especially the letters he's sending to his pen pals that are now getting delayed in transit.
An older boy tells the story about how his dad no longer works at a barbershop but at Amazon instead, and how he's fighting boredom in his house from ""seeing the same people all the time.""
Another girl has become fascinated with her parents' record player and album set she recently discovered.
Several children volunteer that they feel ""really nervous"" and ""scared"" from watching news about the coronavirus on TV.
The discussion also addresses fears around losing those closest to them, including their parents and grandparents.
'She wants to inspire hope'
Alyssa and her mother are African-American. They are both aware of the disproportionately high mortality rate of those in the black community who are infected with the coronavirus. 
Jennings says this fact makes it even more important for Alyssa and her friends, particularly those of color, to have an outlet to talk about their lives and fears around the pandemic.
""The fact that this is virtual has given Alyssa more courage to speak up about her own experience,"" Jennings says. ""She wants to inspire hope.""
""If I know I can get better each time and I can come out of the hospital, they can think that, too. They can come out and spend time with their family again,"" Alyssa says.
Alyssa was encouraged to hear several children on the KidsCovid19 chat bring up the fact that some kids have weakened immune systems so everyone should be more careful.
""I felt a bit proud,"" Alyssa says, ""because it made me feel like I wasn't alone. I wasn't the only kid chosen for this ... they know it's a real thing. It's a big deal.""
Expanding the conversation
In the weeks ahead, with adult supervision, Alyssa is hoping to expand her KidsCovid19 chat group to keep the conversations going.
In the meantime, she is super busy doing schoolwork and managing a coronavirus supply group on Facebook, which started as a social studies project and has since morphed into a volunteer organization.
In the days ahead, Alyssa has two big events unfolding: her next blood test at Inova Fairfax Children's Hospital and her birthday on May 23.
Depending on her white blood cell count, Alyssa will either be escorted directly to the hospital's isolation unit where she will face another quarantine until her immune system strengthens or be allowed to return home to celebrate her birthday.

COVID-19 is a pandemic, the World Health Organization declared in a press briefing Wednesday.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cited not just the leaping numbers of cases, deaths, and countries affected in making the determination but also the slow responses of many countries and governments.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" WHO Director-General, who goes by Dr. Tedros, said.
As of Wednesday, there are over 121,000 cases and over 4,370 deaths in at least 114 countries and territories worldwide.
We expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher, Dr. Tedros said. He urged countries to be prepared.
The declaration doesnt change WHOs response efforts or the recommendations already in place for countries, Dr. Tedros said. And it doesnt mean that containment is a lost cause, he emphasized. It would be a mistake to abandon the containment strategy for countries seeing few or no cases.
Rather, this should be seen as a trigger for more aggressive action and responses, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, added in the briefing. We need to focus on the job at hand, he said, referencing outbreak and emergency responses.
In the past weeks, Drs. Tedros and Ryan have bristled at reporters repeated questions about when or if a pandemic would be declared over the spread of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
There has been so much attention on one word, Dr. Tedros said Wednesday. Its not a word to use lightly. But he gave us some other important terms to focus on: preparedness, public health, political leadership, and people. Were all in this together."

An Amazon worker at a warehouse in Queens, New York, has been infected by the coronavirus, Amazon acknowledged in an email to Ars Technica. ""We are supporting the individual who is now in quarantine,"" a spokesperson wrote.
This appears to be the first Amazon warehouse worker to contract the virus in the United States. Multiple workers have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in Europe.
Amazon says that after learning about the infected worker, the company sent employees home with pay and performed a deep cleaning of the facility. The warehouse has now been re-opened.
""Were following all guidelines from local officials about the operations of our buildings,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees including increased cleaning at all facilities, maintaining social distance, and adding distance between drivers and customers when making deliveries.""
The coronavirus pandemic has only increased the importance of Amazon to the American economy. As customers have grown fearful of catching the virus in brick-and-mortar stores, they've been placing more orders with Amazon. Amazon said this week that it plans to hire an extra 100,000 people to help cope with the surging demand.
However, there's a risk that more Amazon warehouse workers could catch the coronavirus.
Amazon says that it's taking a number of precautions to protect workers. The company says it is maintaining a three-foot separation between workers and has eliminated stand-up meetings during workers' shifts. The company has staggered break times and spread out the chairs in break rooms to minimize contact between employees.
Workers also have unlimited paid sick time through the end of the month, and Amazon says it's requiring workers to stay home if they feel unwell."

While scientists are working to contain the outbreak and come up with effective treatments, health experts say people can still prepare and guard against infection. ABC News spoke with health experts to provide the latest information on how to stay safe as the disease spreads.
1. What are the symptoms?
Novel coronavirus can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe, including cough, fever and shortness of breath. Since the symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, influenza and the common cold, only a diagnostic test can confirm whether an individual has coronavirus.
2. How is it transmitted?
The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.
Person-to-person transmission is mostly likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.
While it's possible the virus could be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.
3. I live in the United States. What should I do?
While there are no clusters of COVID-19 in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans should prepare for transmission of the virus within some communities in the near future, potentially leading to a significant disruption in citizens' daily lives.
The CDC advises making a plan, telling schools and businesses to have systems in place for teleschooling and working remotely if face-to-face interactions must be restricted.
Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.
Call schools and ask if there are plans for teleschooling. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about teleworking options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later.
For now, the CDC recommends Americans uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home from work if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.
4. Should I wear a face mask?
Not unless you are the one who is sick.
The CDC doesnt currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.
""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.
While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.
""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

5. Should I be tested for the virus?
It's probably not up to you.
While the CDC is trying to roll out testing capabilities to states, we're not at that point. If you have symptoms, such as a cough or fever, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.
If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. Few people are expected to fall into that category.
6. Should I cancel my upcoming trip to Europe or Asia?
That depends. How risk averse are you?
The U.S. State Department provides travel advisories that include up-to-date recommendations about which countries have reported cases of COVID-19 and how widespread disease transmissions have been. The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check back often and use that information to inform what's essentially a personal decision.
In addition to considering whether the country in question has seen a significant influx of COVID-19 cases, think about the situation on ground. Has travel within the country been disrupted? How would you feel about the potential of being quarantined upon your return to the United States? If it's a work trip, would the situation on the ground make it difficult to be productive?
The answer may be different for different people. Schaffner, for example, noted that Italy is a big country and that he would feel comfortable traveling to Rome, since the epicenter of Italy's COVID-19 outbreak has is clustered in the northern part of the country. His wife, on the other hand, would not.
""She doesn't have that risk tolerance,"" he said.

7. Do quarantines work?
""The short answer is apparently, yes, and better than we thought,"" Schaffner said.
After China imposed strict quarantine and lockdown measures in hard-hit Hubei province, new cases of COVID-19 appeared to decline, Schaffner explained.
It's too soon to know the full effect of that quarantine, which is essentially an unprecedented public health experiment. And imposing strict quarantine measures on an entire community may not be replicable outside of China.
""Try doing that in New York,"" Schaffner added. ""Ain't gonna happen.""
8. Will the outbreak turn into a pandemic?
The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and with clusters of COVID-19 in countries around the world, including extensive transmission in a number of them, we're certainly on the precipice of that reality.
For the United States, more transmissions in more countries raises the possibility that there will be similar local transmission of the virus here.
""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.
""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss. Widespread transmission is making threat of a pandemic more real.
""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention.""

9. How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?
Concerned enough to pay attention. Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.
Even the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.
""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son earlier in the day that asked whether he should stock up on canned goods.
""I would be included not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""
COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with COVID-19's fatality rate believed to be around 2%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.
""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added.
10. Is there a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19? 
No. There are trials underway in China and elsewhere, but because the virus is new, there's no approved treatment for COVID-19 and a vaccine is likely more than a year away."

But most notable is the gap between what Trump is saying and doing. 
On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted the phrase ""social distancing,"" a measure recommended by the World Health Organization recommends to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aside from staying at home as much as possible, it involves giving yourself at least three feet of distance from others in public. 
You would assume that this tweet means Trump is advising the practice for the American people and would follow it himself. Right?
Wrong.
Hours after typing that tweet with his hopefully well-washed fingers, Trump appeared in the cramped confines of the White House press room (which is even smaller than it looks on TV), closely surrounded by members of his administration and journalists.
Cool cool cool cool cool.

Trump was in front of the podium for around fifteen minutes, dropping several telling bits of information. One of them being that he was tested for coronavirus himself last night, which comes directly after his doctor said he did not need to be tested. 
Trump said he did not know the test results yet. But don't worry, he reassured those in the room by saying he, like everyone else who had entered, has his temperature taken. (Symptoms of the virus can include fever, but also may not be present in an infected person for many days.) 
But it isn't just the lack of social distancing; it's also the handshaking. When asked about the fact that he was still shaking hands at yesterday's press conference, Trump said it was out of a habit that politicians have.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence revealed further developments on how the administration is handling the spread. Effective midnight Monday, the United States will suspend all travel from the UK and Ireland, adding to the list of countries currently barred from travel. Trump remarked that domestic restrictions could be next, but what that means remains to be seen.
After weeks of relative inaction, the Trump administration has spent the past few days rapidly changing course. Only time will tell what the next move is and, more importantly, whether it will actually be effective in this crisis."

We see our friends on Zoom, and treat our Hinge matches like we're in some Austenian courtship. 
After a while, though, video chats and sexts just don't cut it. Many of us turn to masturbating to not only to relieve our newfound horniness (even for a brief time), but also just to give us something to do. Even New York City knows that: In the city government's handout about having sex
 during this time, it says that, ""You are your safest sex partner.""
Given endless boredom and loneliness and New York City's blessing, we are buying sex toys. Lots of sex toys so much so that the industry is booming. 
Sex toy site Adam &amp; Eve, which claims to be the #1 adult toy superstore, has seen a sales spike of over 30% each day for the past week (over numbers from 2019), according to their spokesperson. Some top-sellers include the Satisfyer Pro 2 vibrator, Adam &amp; Eve's g-spot vibrator, and Adam &amp; Eve's rabbit vibrator.  
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus anxiety has exes sliding into the DMs
The spike may not just be from singles, either. In fact, another one of the site's top sellers right now are couple rings. We all have more time on our hands, including couples quarantining together so more the opportunity to buy a new sex toy. Adam &amp; Eve's resident sex therapist, Dr. Jenni Skyler gave Mashable three tips for couples during this time: make a short term list of goals; enlist a daily check-in; and to actually have sex.
It's not just superstores seeing a sales bump from self-isolation, either. 
From the first week of March to the second, Emojibator
 saw a 225 percent increase in overall sales (which includes wholesale, Amazon, and online stores), and a 345 percent increase in online store sales alone. They also sold out two of their signature toys, the original Eggplant Emojibator and their dual clitoral-suction vibrator The Chickie.
""The demand for our products have skyrocketed this past week, in part due to everyone stocking up on their favorite stay-at-home activities with Coronamania,"" said Emojibator co-founder and CMO Kristin Fretz in an emailed statement. Before people in the U.S. began to self-quarantine, they already felt the coronavirus impact in terms of longer shipment wait times, but they were able to restock without significant delays. 
""Exploring your pleasure is really a great way to feel alive during this strange time.""
Dame Products reported a 30 percent increase in sales since February, seeing spikes in certain major cities like New York and Los Angeles. ""So many aspects of our daily life that make us feel human are not accessible right now,"" Alexandra Fine, CEO and co-founder of Dame, told Mashable. ""Exploring your pleasure is really a great way to feel alive during this strange time. More pleasure means better sleep, less stress, and overall improved wellbeing."" 
To keep up with demand, Emojibator will debut limited-edition styles for their toys in the upcoming weeks. Fretz said, ""With the same brand of shame-free wellness our brand was built on, we have been encouraging customers to stay in for a night of self-love to help avoid the pandemic!

Notably, the CEO invited everyone to follow along at home via shared Google Doc. At the time of this writing, the document suggests that $100,000 was given to America's Food Fund on April 2 though the ""link"" field, presumably where proof of the transfer will live, was blank. 
Image: screenshot / google doc
We attempted to reach Dorsey in order to determine both the timeline of the transfer and who will oversee the Start Small fund, but Square declined to comment on those questions. 
""Per the spreadsheet Jack shared in his tweets, you can see transfers and donations already,"" wrote Aaron Zamost, Square's head of communications and policy, over email. ""We'll decline to comment on other procedural details at this time."" 
The CEO did provide some additional, albeit limited, insight into the Start Small LLC, however. 
""Why is #startsmall a LLC,"" he wrote. ""This segments and dedicates my shares to these causes, and provides flexibility. Grants will be made from Start Small Foundation or the LLC directly based on the beneficiary org.""

Notably, moving his equity to an LLC and not, say, an established 501(c)(3) non-profit allows Dorsey an added level of control over how the funds are allocated. It follows in the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg, who in 2015 pledged to ""give"" 99 percent of his Facebook shares to an LLC of his creation over the course of his life. 
Why pull just from Square and not Twitter? Simply: I own a lot more Square. And Ill need to pace the sales over some time. The impact this money will have should benefit both companies over the long-term because its helping the people we want to serve.

They labeled this group as ""higher risk."" 
However, another group of people could be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and hasn't received as much attention: people who smoke, vape or have substance use disorders. 
""[T]he research community should be alert to the possibility that [Covid-19] could hit some populations with substance use disorders particularly hard,"" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote in a blog post published last week. 
Because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape may be especially threatened, Volkow said. 
""When someone's lungs are exposed to flu or other infections the adverse effects of smoking or vaping are much more serious than among people who do not smoke or vape,"" Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control &amp; Education at University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a blog post updated Tuesday.
""Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia which push foreign things out...[T]he ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,"" Glantz said in a phone interview.
The CDC reported on Wednesday that young adults under age 44 make up a big part of Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US, and Glantz questions whether the vaping epidemic might have contributed to this.
""Some of my pulmonary [colleagues] have noted people under 30 [with Covid-19] ending up in hospitals and a couple were vapors,"" Glantz said. However, he said, there hasn't been enough research or evidence to support whether there's a link.
People who smoke are generally at an increased risk of serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, when they have a severe infection.
The odds of a Covid-19 case becoming more severe -- and at the most extreme, leading to death -- were 14 times higher among people who had a history of smoking compared to those who did not smoke, Glantz said, citing a study from China published in the peer-reviewed Chinese Medical Journal in February. The study also found those with a history of smoking had a 14% higher risk of developing pneumonia. 
Concerns about other drugs
Besides smoking and e-cigarettes, Volkow wrote that people who abuse opioids and methamphetamine may be at risk for serious complications of Covid-19 because of the effects these drugs have on respiratory and pulmonary health.
Opioids slow breathing and have already been shown to increase mortality in people with respiratory diseases, according to Volkow. ""[T]hus diminished lung capacity from COVID-19 could similarly endanger this population,"" she said.
Methamphetamine has been shown to produce significant pulmonary damage since it binds heavily to pulmonary tissue, Volkow explained in a phone interview. This will likely increase the risk of negative outcomes if used during a Covid-19 infection. 
People with substance use disorders also rely on treatment that traditionally involves human interaction, such as therapy sessions or methadone clinics, which will be challenging in the setting of wide-spread social distancing, according to Dr. Allison Lin, assistant professor in psychiatry and the addiction center at the University of Michigan.
Lin said it's important for everyone to quit smoking due to its unknown -- but potentially serious -- effects on Covid-19 patients. This is particularly important for people with substance use disorders since they are more likely to smoke, she said.
For everyone infected with Covid-19, one thing people can do now to reduce the risk of serious illness is quitting smoking, according to Glantz. 
""At a time when people are looking to reduce risk, it's very sensible to stop insulting your lungs,"" he said.

In 2017, she was distinguished as CNN Hero of the Year. The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)While the shutdown of routine daily life, including the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 outbreak, is like nothing most of us have ever experienced, I can't help feeling a little bit of déjà vu. 
When I was 15 and living in what was then my home in Aman, Jordan, my school closed for three months during the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War. I was terrified. Even though we were living through a war Jordan had sided with Iraq it was hard for me to imagine that it would come to this; school closures, not being able to see friends and constant worry about what would happen next. 
Today, I lead schools for refugee children in grades six to 12 near Atlanta, Georgia, and in Columbus, Ohio. And, as you can imagine, this isn't the first time my students have faced disruptions in their education. So, while I know this is tough for families I'm a mom to three young children myself parents should take comfort in knowing that kids are resilient, and we will get through this. 
I do think there are steps we can take, though, to ensure we do so as smoothly as possible.
Prioritize mental and physical health
First, I think it's important to remember that families' mental and physical health needs to be our top priority. Kids can't learn if they're hungry or sick. I know from working with my students at Fugees Academy schools that we can help kids catch up academically. But overcoming trauma and families will face trauma in the current environment will take more time.
We need to make sure those who are food insecure or facing urgent health care needs are getting access to meals and services. Communities that have activated their bus routes to deliver meals to those in need are setting a great example. And we need to ensure everyone is taking the time to exercise, get outdoors safely and connect by calling, texting and using social media tools. 
For example, the teachers at Fugees Academy schools are having morning check-ins using the Zoom videoconference service with 10 to 15 students at a time. Each day, they pose a question to their students to try to spark a conversation that will help them process their feelings. One of the questions we ask is, ""What are you afraid of?"" This lets us know if there are families in crisis that we need to try to help.
Time to bridge the digital divide
It's vital to be honest about the fact that connecting this way means ensuring all students have access to the internet and computer devices, which is not the reality for many kids. A Pew Research Center analysis of 2015 US Census Bureau data showed that 15% of households with school-age children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home. The center's analysis also found that 12% of teens in the country do not have a computer at home, adding to the burden of what has come to be known as the ""homework gap.""
At our tuition-free independent schools, we've made computers available to our students. Thankfully, internet providers in our communities are giving free service to those in need at this time. That should happen broadly, and any government relief efforts around the current crisis ought to tackle bridging the digital divide.
Build routine and support teachers
It's not by chance we're having our teachers check in with students at 10 a.m. every day. Kids need routine and structure, and we've generally asked them to make 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. traditional learning time with breaks for lunch and exercise. 
Schools and school systems need to support teachers, who are being asked to do something entirely new. We first took a week for teacher training and then put class structures in place using tools like Zoom, ClassDojo and Google Classroom. We're being creative about using a private Facebook group to run soccer practices remotely. We can't debate who gets the corner kick, but we can run sprint drills and practice pushups and burpees together. We're also using the group for yoga classes and dance parties!
 Greater accountability and flexibility
While we're trying to make this version of school fun for our students, we're letting them know we're holding them accountable. I know some school systems are saying the semester will be graded on a pass/fail basis, but we want to motivate kids to try hard and have decided to give grades but be flexible on how we assess student work.
We're taking care to assign homework that's manageable. Without access to a teacher in person, it probably doesn't make sense to assign problem sets that are going to have kids getting stuck or spinning their wheels. 
As I mentioned, I'm a mom to three kids, ages 1, 4 and 5 a lot younger than the students who attend Fugees Academy schools. My wife, Emily, and I are only asking our pre-K and kindergarten daughters to do about an hour's worth of academic work each day. But that doesn't mean we're not sneaking in learning when we plant a garden and space out the plants or bake a cake and measure the ingredients. 
And while this is a great time to try activities you might not ordinarily have time to do, it's important to stick with routines and traditions. That's why we still have Friday family movie nights, focusing on funny and uplifting films. Olaf, from ""Frozen,"" had us all giggling last week. Humor is such a help.
Perspective is critical, too. We'll get through this. I know firsthand that it can be hard to keep perspective at times like this. But I'm hopeful we'll come out of it for the better having kept a close eye on the most vulnerable among us, a clear-eyed view of the need for greater equity in our education system, a deep appreciation for our schools and teachers and great love for our family and friends."

The study used an antibody blood test to estimate how many people had been infected with Covid-19 in the past. Other tests, like those performed with nasal swabs or saliva, test for the virus' genetic material, which does not persist long after recovery, as antibodies do.
""We found that there are many, many unidentified cases of people having Covid infection that were never identified with it with a virus test,"" said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and one of the paper's authors. ""It's consistent with findings from around the world that this disease, this epidemic is further along than we thought.""
The study estimated that 2.49% to 4.16% of people in Santa Clara Country had been infected with Covid-19 by April 1. This represents between 48,000 and 81,000 people, which is 50 to 85 times what county officials recorded by that date: 956 confirmed cases.
A preprint study is a draft version of a study released to the public that hasn't been peer-reviewed for publication in a journal. CNN has reached out to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department for comment.
Similar efforts to estimate local antibody prevalence have launched in places like Miami-Dade County, Florida; San Miguel County, Colorado; and Los Angeles, California. The National Institutes of Health has a similar effort underway as well.
Bhattacharya said information from these studies will not only give researchers a better idea on antibody prevalence, but they will also vastly improve projections and disease modeling. Experts have said it's clear there have been more people infected than we've tested for, but it's unclear how much higher that number could be.
""All of the projection models have this as an input: how many people have been infected today,"" Bhattacharya said.
""It just helps us plan better,"" he added. ""Before, we were making policy in the dark.""
The research may also give a more realistic sense of how deadly the virus really is.
""If I get the infection, how likely is it I'm going to die? That number depends on knowing how many people have had the infection -- not just actively have it now, but have had it and recovered from it,"" Bhattacharya said. 
If 50 times more people have had the infection, the death rate could drop by that same factor, putting it ""somewhere between 'little worse than the flu' to 'twice as bad as the flu' in terms of case fatality rate,"" Bhattacharya said. 
But he cautioned that the flu and coronavirus are still quite different. For one, we don't yet have a vaccine for Covid-19.
Doctors suspect, though, and are still trying to prove beyond a doubt, that antibodies to Covid-19 mean one is immune down the line.
The study in Santa Clara County recruited participants largely using Facebook ads targeted by zip code to sample various parts of the community. The study tested 3,330 adults and children.
""They had about five different tents set up and you just kind of drove through and they pricked your finger, took a blood sample and took down your information,"" one of those participants, Tony Huston, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast, ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""
""I think it's human nature to want to know if you've had it or if you have the antibodies,"" Huston said."

He was 52. 
""As many of you are aware, Adam had been hospitalized with Covid-19 and although he had been making some small improvements over the last few days, Adam's condition was critical and he was ultimately unable to recover from Covid-19 complications,"" read a statement from the band's attorney, provided to CNN. ""He was truly a prolific talent and even more so, a loving and devoted father, son and friend."" 
It added: ""We are terribly sorry to convey this loss."" 
Schlesinger's band, which was co-founded with Chris Collingwood, was best known for its 2003 hit ""Stacy's Mom,"" a humorous track about a young boy who has a crush on his friend's mother. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award. 
But Schlesinger had success before that as a songwriter. He co-wrote the title track to the 1996 Tom Hanks film ""That Thing You Do,"" and received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for his work. 
After success with Fountains of Wayne, Schlesinger continued to branch out, earning Tony nominations for his work on the musical ""Cry-Baby"" and numerous Emmy nominations for other work, which included collaborations with Stephen Colbert and ""Sesame Street."" 
He won an Emmy last year for a song he co-wrote for CW's ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"" a show for which he wrote more than 100 songs and earned several nominations over the years. 
Schlesinger was hospitalized this week. 
A statement from his family, released by Collingwood via Twitter, confirmed Schlesinger was diagnosed with Covid-19. Schlesinger was put on a ventilator and sedated ""to facilitate his recovery."" 
""He is receiving excellent care, his condition is improving and we are cautiously optimistic,"" the statement said. ""His family appreciates all of the love and support."" 
News of his illness prompted an outpouring of well wishes from the music industry and beyond, as did word of his passing. 
""I am grasping for the right words. My dear friend Adam Schlesinger has passed away from Covid-19,"" wrote Dashboard Confessional singer Chris Carrabba on Twitter. ""I knew him best as a mentor, and a friend."" 
He added: ""We must take this seriously. People are sick and dying. It is hard to stay locked indoors but lives will be saved. Take care of each other. Rest In Peace, my dear friend.""
Schlesinger was writing the lyrics and music for a new theater production with comedian Sarah Silverman at the time of his death, the attorney's statement added. 
Schlesinger was survived by his two daughters, Sadie and Claire, his life partner Alexis Morley, his parents Barbara and Stephen Schlesinger and his sister Lauren, according to the statement."

She spent 10 days on a ventilator to help her breathe. But she fought the virus and was released from the Austin hospital after 16 days. 
To celebrate her recovery, staff at St. David's South Austin Medical Center lined the halls and cheered for her as she was being discharged.
Scenes like this are occurring at hospitals across the nation symbolizing hope in such a dark time.
At Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, the song ""Here Comes the Sun"" by The Beatles plays over the speaker system every time a Covid-19 patient is discharged, according to a hospital official.
""Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces,"" the lyrics for the song read. ""Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here.""
New York is one of the major epicenters for the American coronavirus outbreak with more than 181,000 confirmed cases and at least 8,650 deaths.
Another New York hospital, this one in Hudson Valley, is also using music to bring a little joy to medical staff and patients who are battling the pandemic. Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus told a local radio show that the song ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey plays when a Covid-19 patient is released.
Other hospitals, just like in Austin, are lining the hallways and sending off their released patients with claps and cheers. In Arkansas, a veteran, who staff named their ""first miracle patient,"" waved to staff as he was greeted with signs of encouragement and applause as he was being escorted to his family waiting outside of the hospital.
The Intensive Care Staff at Yale New Haven Hospital Saint Raphael Campus in Connecticut cheered, clapped and held signs of encouragement for a patient that was being transferred out of the ICU and to a regular room.
Moments like these are being shared on social media and giving hope to others as the cases across the US top 530,000.

But British scientists are skeptical,"British scientists have pushed back against an influential new coronavirus model that predicts the UK will be the worst-hit European country, with a death toll from Covid-19 possibly much higher than previously thought.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/health/uk-death-toll-coronavirus-estimate-gbr-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200408113506-coronavirus-uk-0406-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-08T18:28:25Z,"London (CNN)British scientists have pushed back against an influential new coronavirus model that predicts the UK will be the worst-hit European country, with a death toll from Covid-19 possibly much higher than previously thought. 
The grim forecast came from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine in Seattle on Tuesday. It predicted 66,314 people would die of Covid-19 in the UK by early August. 
The British government's plan for tackling the epidemic has been largely informed by a study from the Imperial College London, which said that a lockdown and social distancing measures would -- hopefully -- limit the number of deaths to between 20,000 and 30,000.
But several high-profile scientists in the UK have already voiced their concerns over the IHME model. 
Professor Sylvia Richardson, of Cambridge University and the co-chair of the Royal Statistical Society Task Force on Covid-19, told the Science Media Centre theprojections are based on ""very strong assumptions about the way the epidemic will progress.""
She said the model was ""based mostly on using the experience in other countries to fit a smooth curve to the counts of deaths reported so far in the UK, rather than any modeling of the epidemic itself."" 
""Methods like this are well known for being extremely sensitive, and are likely to change dramatically as new information comes in,"" Richardson added.
Like most other countries, the UK has been racing to increase its healthcare capacity ahead of the predicted peak of the epidemic. A new field hospital in east London with a capacity of up to 5,000 beds, the NHS Nightingale, accepted its first patients on Wednesday. 
However, the IHME model suggests this might not be enough. It said the shortage of intensive care (ICU) beds would peak at 23,745 on April 17.
The IHME said the peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds, which compares to the 17,765 currently available. It added that 24,544 ICU beds will be needed, compared to the 799 beds it estimates will be available.
Professor David Spiegelhalter, who chairs the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at University of Cambridge, told the Science Media Centre he was ""very skeptical"" of the projections. 
""[They] are based on assuming a rather simple mathematical model for the whole course of the epidemic,"" he said. ""I suspect they will change a lot as new data arrives -- we shall see.""
Epidemiological modeling is a tricky discipline, because it relies in part on assumptions. The models often need updating as more data comes in.
""The outputs of any model should not really be treated as a prediction of what is going to happen,"" said Dr. Simon Gubbins, head of the Transmission Biology Group at The Pirbright Institute in England. ""Rather they represent plausible scenarios, based on knowledge at the time they were generated and assumptions made in the model ... that can be used to help inform decisions of policy makers,"" he told the Science Media Centre.
The authors of the IHME forecast admit their model is highly uncertain, giving the range of possible deaths in the UK as between55,022 and 79,995.
This was the first time the IHME team published models for several European countries, including the UK. On Wednesday, the institute updated its US forecast, predicting 60,415 deaths in the country, significantly fewer than the 82,000 it predicted on Tuesday.
The researchers based their findings on models of the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan, the Chinese city which was the original epicenter of the outbreak, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including the Spanish capital of Madrid and the Lombardy region in Italy.
They also factored in data from local and national governments, the World Health Organization and information on each country's social distancing policies.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday morning, said it's likely U.S. schools might have to ""shut down"" and public transportation"" could likely be affected -- but only in an offhand comment about the virus not being ""a death sentence.""
Recounting how he had gotten a note from a reporter asking what hes going to do to calm the markets, he said he might tell people to turn off their televisions.
It is real? It absolutely is real, Mulvaney said while adding that 20 million Americans get the flu each year. This is not Ebola, OK? Its not SARS, its not MERS, he said, referring to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, pointing to their high fatality rates.
Its not a death sentence, he said. Its much easier to get than Ebolabut this is something we know how to deal with.
Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. May you see impacts on public transportation? Sure. But we do this. We know how to handle this,"" he added.
Mulvaney said the administration visited the Capitol earlier this year, for briefings with health experts for the House and Senate, but few members showed up as Trump's Senate impeachment trial was underway.
We took extraordinary steps four of five weeks ago. Why didnt you hear about it? What was going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment! Mulvaney said. And thats all the press wanted to talk about.
He also mentioned the travel restrictions against China Trump ordered over a month ago, in order to prevent the further outbreak, complaining that some Democrats complained the move was racist.
The press was covering their hoax of the day because they thought it might bring down the president, he said. The reason youre seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to bring down the president.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, also speaking at CPAC and echoing comments made on Fox News, contended Democrats will take anything that they can use to try to hurt Trump.
Anything he does in a positive sensethey will not give him credit for, he said. The playbook is old at this point, but for them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here, and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness.
He also addressed the falling markets.
There's no question that the threat of coronavirus can destabilize the market, but the fact that the Democrats are seemingly hoping for this to happen, just like you've seen them over the last year, pray for a disaster to happen in the economy, meaning people lose their jobs, their mortgages, their livelihoods, so that they can own Trump somehow, is absolutely insane, he said.
Watching 50 percent of our U.S. government pray for that to collapse, pray for the destruction of those families and those jobs is truly a new low for Democrats that have been exceeding lows in an unprecedented fashion over the last few years, he said.
On Fox News, host Sean Hannity opened his program Thursday night saying, ""I can report the sky is absolutely falling. We're all doomed. The end is near. The apocalypse is imminent and you're going to die, all of you, in the next 48 hours and it's all President Trump's fault -- or at least that's what the media mob and the Democratic extreme radical Socialist Party would like you to think.""
President Trump Thursday evening said of the novel coronavirus, ""like a miracle, it will disappear"" but that ""nobody really knows.""
""It's like a miracle -- it will disappear,"" Trump said in an unscheduled gathering in the Cabinet room with members of the African American community. ""And from our shores, you know, it could get worse before it gets better. Could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.""
After introductions around the table, the president launched into a staunch defense of his administrations handling of coronavirus, while slamming the media and Democrats for bringing politics into the response.
I know politics, and you know, politics is fine, Trump said. But when it comes time to talk about pandemics or whatever you may want to call it, you got to get away from politics.

He also gave his administration high marks, saying the response so far has been incredible.
If we're doing a great job, we should congratulate these professionals that are the best in the world. And you know what, if we were doing a bad job, we should also be criticized, but we have done an incredible job,"" he added.
Trump did not mention the stock market, which plunged for the fifth day in a row Friday, falling more than 800 points after the opening bell, but he said earlier in the week it ""will recover.""

Shortly after, at another White House Black History month event, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touted Trump's decision to close U.S. borders to travelers from China and other nations, saying ""it has kept America safe"" and ""bought us time.""
""The president really deserves incredible credit because he got on this within days and weeks of learning from China about this and took action that people attacked him for,"" Azar said. ""People attacked him for these actions on controlling our borders and quarantining people that has kept America safe. It has bought us time, so thank you, Mr. President.""
Vice President Mike Pence, who held a photo op with Azar Thursday to publicly show he was taking the lead in the administration effort, was headed to Florida Friday to deliver remarks to make a political speech at the Club for Growths annual conference in West Palm Beach and later speak at a GOP fundraiser for House Republicans in Sarasota, Florida.
While there are no confirmed cases in Florida so far, the vice president scheduled a meeting in between the political events with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.
House members on Friday morning assembled on Capitol Hill for a closed briefing on the novel coronavirus from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIAID), and other administration officials and federal health professionals.
Sources told ABC News on Thursday that all statements to the public, including those from officials with the Centers for Disease Control to Health and Human Services, must first be cleared through the vice president's office.
Critics say that has the potential for the White House to censor information.
But lawmakers in the House briefing said Dr. Fauci told them he had not been put under a gag order.
Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Friday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pressed by House Democrats for both the admin's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak -- though the original reason for the hearing was to address the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani more than two months ago.
Asked about the administration's proposed cuts to the global health budget, Pompeo said with a smile, ""We'll have plenty of money.""
Democrats jumped in to say the administration's lost credibility and sent mixed messages on the COVID-19 oubtreak, at first prompting Pompeo to push back that the hearing was supposed to be about Iran.
Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, accused the administration of a ""blatant disregard for facts,"" saying it's left the American people unsure of whom to trust. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., condemned what he called a ""pattern"" of ""misinformation""-- pointing to Trump's statements on vaccines and warm weather.
""This impacts everyone in America -- and it's more important than politics Mr. Secretary. The administration must do better,"" he said.
Several Republicans pushed back against the Democrats in the room, with Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., calling their behavior an ""embarrassment"" and the hearing a ""joke."" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. said they were ""out of hand"" and he was ""deeply angry"" at them.
On the COVID-19 outbreak, Pompeo said the U.S. has reached out to Iran and through its partners to offer U.S. assistance.

Perhaps the need to win the public’s trust is also part of the thinking behind the companies’ new shift to calling their system “exposure notification” instead of “contact tracing.”
The rollout of this system will come in phases.Google and Apple are targeting a pre-release for public-health app developers as soon as next week. This wouldn’t mean the functionality is available to users yet. But it would mean that developers can start to test the seed version of the OS update supporting their new APIs. Apple and Google noted new functions in the API would allow developers to decide for themselves how physically close two phones would have to be to register an interaction, as well as for how long.
Public health authorities, such as the UK’s National Health Service, are ultimately going to create the apps that users will download and opt into, not Apple and Google. A full launch of the API is still slated for mid-May, which will allow for broader testing and the ultimate launch of health authority apps. The next phase will be adding interfaces directly into Android and iOS to allow users to activate and disable beaconing on a system-wide level. This, the companies say, will take months.
These are all still the early stages of developinga mammoth infrastructure to help countries trace the spread of COVID-19, paving the way to a reopening of society.

To log into the app, workers will have to take a daily wellness check. If they confirm symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough or difficulty breathing, they’ll be logged off for the day and told to contact their physician. Independent contractors (known as “full-service” shoppers) and part-time employees (in-store shoppers, shift leads and site managers) who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or forced to quarantine will still receive up to 14 days of financial assistance.
Chances are these measures won’t appease workers who went on strike a few weeks ago. Instacart tried to avoid the demonstration by making a few concessions, but shoppers said those didn’t go far enough. They pointed out that there’s still no sick pay for workers who stay home due to health conditions that put them at a high risk and that the company failed to address demands for hazard pay.
Shoppers also criticized Instacart for not providing hand sanitizer fast enough. Just a few days ago, many shoppers said they still hadn’t received the promised safety gear.
In its announcement today, Instacart promised in-store shoppers, shift leads and site managers will continue to receive bonuses ranging from $25 to $200 -- but that appears to leave out full-service shoppers. Instacart is also making it possible to request “health and safety” kits with masks and hand sanitizer from the Instacart Shopper app.
Instacart will continue offering a contactless delivery option. The company has also expanded its Costco pharmacy deliveries nationwide. It’s working on a “first available shopper” option to expedite deliveries, and it now lets customers order up to two weeks ahead, instead of one.
Of course, Instacart isn’t alone in its struggle to provide worker protections and meet a growing demand for grocery delivery. Nearly all online grocery delivery services are facing unprecedented stress and having their vulnerabilities exposed."

The deaths of the patients took place over the last 24 hours, but NYC Health and Hospitals/Elmhurst said in a statement that number is consistent with the number of Intensive Care Unit patients being treated there.
""Staff are doing everything in our power to save every person who contracts Covid-19,"" the statement said. 
New York has more than 30,000 of the nation's more than 65,000 coronavirus cases, and 285 of its residents have died fromthe virus. The state has called for tens of thousands more ventilators, hospital beds and intensive care beds to meet the needs of their hospitals. 
Elmhurst is at the center of the crisis, the statement said, and staff is working to overcome the overwhelming numbers.
""The frontline staff are going above and beyond in this crisis, and we continue surging supplies and personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis,"" the statement said.
""We are literally increasing the effective capacity of the hospital on a daily basis by sending more doctors, nurses, ventilators and PPE to meet demand.""
New York has ordered residents to stay at home to curb the spread of the virus and hopefully ease pressures on healthcare systems. And though Gov. Andrew Cuomo pointed to Westchester County -- home to thestate's first severe outbreak in New Rochelle -- as a marker for the effectiveness of social distancing, cases continue to climb.
Estimates from Sunday showed coronavirus hospitalizations were doubling every 2 days, he said. But Monday's estimates showed hospitalizations were doubling every 3.4 days, and Tuesday's estimates showed hospitalizations were doubling every 4.7 days.
Cuomo warned that the rest of the nation could see numbers like those in his state.
""Where we are today, you will be in three weeks or four weeks or five weeks or six weeks,"" he said. ""What we do here will chart the course.""

CNN spoke with five hospital workers at Sinai-Grace Hospital, part of the Detroit Medical Center system, who said staff members feel they don't have enough coworkers or supplies to deal with the crisis.
Many of the patients in the ER are presumed Covid-19 positive because they have viral symptoms, but their test results take days to process, hospital workers said.
Conditions are so drastic at Sinai-Grace that on Sunday night, all of the emergency room's night shift nursing staff --seven in total -- staged a sit-in, where they refused to work and demanded that more nurses be sent in to help. 
Patients at Sinai-Grace aren't just two-to-a-room -- they have been lining many of the hallways in the emergency room, according to the four health care workers. Two workers said critically ill patients, including ventilated patients, have been at times kept in the hallways.
At least two patients in the ER have died in hallway beds, according to a physician at the facility. Health care workers at the hospital, including the physician, spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their jobs.
""We've had patients die in hallway beds because the nurse didn't find they didn't have a pulse until it was too late,"" the physician said. ""Each nurse has so many patients that by the time they come to check on their next one, there is a chance that patient may not have a pulse anymore.""
Another patient's breathing tube disconnected from the ventilator, and the patient died before staff could respond, two ER workers told CNN. 
Michigan has the third-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the US, behind New York and New Jersey, according to Johns Hopkins University. Cases have skyrocketed from 300 less than a month ago to over 20,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.
A number of hospitals around the country are nearing or have reached capacity because of the surge in Covid-19 patients.
Out of respect for the privacy of the patient and family members, Brian Taylor, Detroit Medical Center communications and media relations director said the medical center would not be providing or commenting on any details regarding the care of any particular patient. 
""It's important to understand that everyday emergency rooms all over the country face dynamic situational challenges and even more so now in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis,"" he said.
Although Detroit Medical Center did not address the specific situations raised by the hospital workers, they provided CNN with a lengthy statement explaining the difficult situation it is in.
""Like many hospital systems, the demand to care for the ever-increasing number of patients is putting a strain on our resources and staff,"" Taylor told CNN in a statement. ""Surge plans are in place at our hospital to handle the increase in patient volumes to ensure we provide the safest and most appropriate care for our patients.""
The Sinai-Grace emergency room has more traffic than any other hospital in metro Detroit and it's the only hospital in Northwest Detroit, Taylor said. There are also a large number of nursing homes in its vicinity, so the hospital is receiving more critically ill patients, Taylor said.
Sinai-Grace's patient population has, ""extremely high rates of underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, which puts people at higher risk for COVID-19,"" Taylor said.
The hospital has been using all available space, Taylor said, including converted operating rooms, outpatient areas and recovery rooms, to handle the surge. It's also working to move patients from hospital to hospital within their system, or to other hospitals in the region.
""We are safely and appropriately using the necessary supplies and equipment, including monitors and ventilators, to care for our patients and are continually sourcing around the world for additional supplies as the number of COVID-19 patients needing care continues to grow,"" he said in his statement.
Workers at Sinai-Grace, though, said that with the increase in patients, the hospital at times hasn't had enough of the cardiac monitors that sound an alarm when a patient's vital signs change, according to three of the health care workers. 
Staff members have also had to make hard decisions about who even gets monitors. 
""We've done our best with monitors,"" one ER worker said. ""But we have patients that we know are going to pass so we take them off a monitor and give [it] to someone else that needs [it].""
According to that worker, one patient without a monitor died in the ER hallway. The patient was showing signs of rigor mortis by the time staff members were aware that the patient had died.
'We do our best to be next to them when they pass'
Even if a patient is on a monitor and alarms begin to go off, staff isn't always able to respond in time, two ER employees said.
In at least two instances, even though monitor alarms had gone off, the hospital was so busy that by the time nurses were able to get there, the patients had died, the ER employees said. 
""(The nurses) walked up to them and they had no pulses,"" one ER worker said. ""They were on the monitor, but it was too much to watch everyone safely."" 
For patients, specifically elderly ones with high risk factors for Covid-19, two ER workers told CNN that staff at Sinai-Grace are calling the families of elderly patients and, ""encouraging them to make patient DNR (do-not-resuscitate)/DNI (do-not-intubate)."" 
That means that if a patient goes into respiratory or cardiac arrest, staff says they do not attempt to intervene and let the patient pass. 
During their shifts, hospital employees are not working to resuscitate some patients that have, or are presumed to have, Covid-19, according to three members of the ER staff. Performing CPR or restarting a patient's heart would mean employees would be exposed to Covid-19, said one worker.
CNN specifically asked about the ER staff's policies of calling patient families, and not resuscitating presumed Covid-19 patients, but Taylor did not respond directly to that.
There is no hospital-wide do-not-resuscitate policy, DMC's Taylor told CNN.
""As for decisions on whether a patient receives CPR, these decisions are made on a case by case basis by physicians and the medical care team,"" Taylor said. ""If a patient requires CPR of course the patient will receive CPR."" 
""We do our best to be next to them when they pass,"" another ER worker said, ""But oftentimes all of the nurses are busy with other patients."" 
When patients do die, staff members have to quickly move them to temporary refrigerated storage that's been brought in, two hospital workers said.
""We have to put people next to each other and on top of each other, because it's been non-stop,"" one said. ""I do my best to close their eyes and say a little prayer.""
Tubes, cords, even ventilators crowd the ER hallways
Ventilated Covid-19 patients are normally kept in an isolated room because the ventilator can aerosolize the virus -- especially if the ventilator tube disconnects -- spreading it through the air, according to multiple healthcare workers across the US that CNN has spoken with.
There are so many patients in stretchers in the hallways that electrical cords and even oxygen tubes are littering them, two health care workers said, describing the extraordinary measures they are taking to handle the situation. They have to keep the cords and tubes in the hallways, they said, because they are all necessary supplies that keep the patients -- some who are critically ill -- alive.
The hospital is still treating walk-ins and ambulance arrivals, including non-Covid-19 patients, according to four health care workers.
""There's times walking into that hospital it looks like a third world country in a war zone,"" one Detroit emergency medical technician, who has transported patients to Sinai-Grace, told CNN.
""Walking through is an eerie feeling,"" the EMT said. ""Nurses, physicians and respiratory therapists running around, everyone is on a vent, every vent is beeping, patients are on multiple IV drips. You would've thought it was a military hospital in a war zone.""

Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus, but there wasn't much to it. 
All she had was a really low-grade temperature, one that the doctors didn't even really consider to be a fever, she said. She had some congestion, but she was on the mend. He wasn't all that worried, either, when he started feeling unwell. After all, they were both young and healthy.
The two worked in the Cliffside Park School District in New Jersey, both as special education teachers -- she at School #4, he at School #6. A star baseball player in high school, he continued his passion by coaching the varsity baseball team. 
For Ben, however, his symptoms quickly became more severe. He had more shortness of breath, and by the last Friday in March, he told Brandy it was time to go to the emergency room. ""He was really concerned,"" Brandy says. ""He came into our bedroom where I was laying, and he said, you know, I've got to go, I've got to take myself to the hospital."" 
""Are you sure you want to go there?"" she asked him. He said ""Yes, I need to."" Immediately, Brandy drove him to the hospital. She couldn't go in with him, though, because they weren't accepting visitors. So, she sat in the car the entire evening and they texted back and forth. ""He updated me the whole time,"" she said. 
At the hospital, Ben received oxygen and responded well, Brandy said. They gave him fluids and Tylenol and then sent him home that same evening. ""Keep doing what you're doing at home,"" they said.
The following Sunday, he was feeling better and showing signs of improvement, his wife said. He got out of bed and ate dinner for the first time.
""Sunday was a great day. He was up moving around, talking to us,"" Brandy said. Ben was on the road to recovery, it seemed. That night, however, his symptoms returned.
""Ben always said the nights had been the worst for him, he would sweat and when he laid down a certain way,"" Brandy said. ""It was particularly hard for him to breathe.""
That night, Ben had an especially hard time getting comfortable. Because Ben was sleeping in the bedroom, and Brandy on the couch, they were texting back and forth to communicate. At one point, Ben texted his wife and said, ""I'm struggling."" Brandy asked him if he needed to go back to the ER, and Ben replied that he wasn't sure.
""So, I just tried to do as much as I could to make him comfortable, you know, calm down his breathing, you know, get him to cool down,"" Brandy said. She borrowed a humidifier from a friend to try that. 
Once Ben finally settled into bed, Brandy listened through the door of their bedroom.
""I could hear through the door that he was still breathing, and I fell asleep,"" she said. She checked in on him again at 2 a.m, and all seemed OK. However, when she woke at 6 a.m., she found her 30-year-old husband lifeless in their bed. 
""Whether he knew you for five minutes or he knew you for his whole entire life, he would give you the same respect and try to reach out and help you and make you laugh in any way possible. That was just the type of selfless person he was,"" remembered Brandy. 
As I listened to Brandy tell the story, my heart broke for her. They were husband and wife, but also best friends, both working in the same school district, driving to work every day. She didn't know what she would do with herself on Monday, let alone the rest of her life. 
And Brandy was left with a mystery. She knew her husband was sick, but how was it possible that a young, healthy 30-year-old with no pre-existing conditions declined so swiftly?
Ben Luderer's story is one of many that have perplexed health officials around the globe. Why is it that some young people are getting sick and dying so abruptly? 
It is true that Covid-19 seems to most seriously affect older people, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. It could be that an elderly person's immune systems may not be able to fight off the disease as well, and the virus can more easily replicate, overwhelming the body and causing multiple organ system failure.
And yet, as we start to look deeper and hear more stories, it is becoming apparent there are many people like Ben, who are younger and still get very sick and die. I recently heard the story of 39-year-old Conrad Buchanan, a healthy, vivacious Florida DJ, who also died after having coronavirus despite having no underlying conditions, according to his wife. 
We have known for some time that this new disease, Covid-19, was not only an older person's disease. It has become clear that the young and healthy are by no means immune to this infection and could become sick enough to require hospitalization. 
In an early snapshot from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for 2,449 patients whose age was known, 18% were between age 45 and 54, and 29% were between 20 and 44 years old. Among those who were hospitalized, 18% were ages 45 to 54 and 20% were ages 20 to 44.
Younger people are far less likely to die, but there is an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging. As Dr. Anthony Fauci told me, it is what makes the coronavirus such an ""unusual disease."" 
""I'm fascinated,"" he said, "" ... by what I would call the pathogenesis.""
""You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a cardio-pulmonary machine) and they're dead,"" Fauci told me when I interviewed him for my podcast, ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" 
""I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out.""
So, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die.
One possibility is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene. ACE2 is an enzyme that that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart. In an article in Science magazine, Immunologist Dr. Philip Murphy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that ""variations in the ACE2 gene that alter the receptor could make it easier or harder for the virus to get into lung cells."" 
It is also possible that a critical ingredient produced by the body, known as surfactant, which better allows the lungs to expand and contract, becomes depleted in some patients infected with the coronavirus. If you think of your lungs as a sponge, surfactant would be the detergent which would make them soft and pliable. Without surfactant, however, your lung becomes stiff and hard to squeeze. It may be why some patients continue to struggle even on a breathing machine.
Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place. In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs. In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well. Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.
Perhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.
To better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age. While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people, like Ben and Conrad, we need to better understand. 
For now, no matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same. Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible. Even if you do develop mild symptoms, it is probably best to stay home to recover. 
But if you develop trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, sudden confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, please, it is time to go to the hospital. 
 Ben Luderer's wife says doctors still can't explain exactly what happened.
 ""We don't really know,"" Brandy told us. ""I don't really know.""
For now, all she can do is take things minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day to process how quickly her life changed.

Rand Paul of Kentucky announced Tuesday that he has successfully recovered from his bout with the novel coronavirus and is now volunteering at a hospital to help patients stricken with Covid-19. 
""I appreciate all the best wishes I have received. I have been retested and I am negative. I have started volunteering at a local hospital to assist those in my community who are in need of medical help, including Coronavirus patients. Together we will overcome this!"" Paul, who is also a doctor, wrote in a tweet. 
The tweet included a photo of the senator, half-smiling and wearing a white lab coat. 
The announcement comes a little over two weeks after Paul announced he had been diagnosed with coronavirus, making him the first known US senator to have been infected with it. 
Paul, who, at the time, said he was asymptomatic, had faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike following his diagnosis because he had hadn't self-quarantined while he awaited his results. GOP senators told CNN last month that Paul was in the gym with colleagues the morning of the day he announced his positive results, and several pointed out how close he had sat to others during Senate lunches at the time. 
The senator later defended his actions, saying in a statement following his diagnosis that ""the current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.""
In addition to Paul, four US representatives also tested positive for coronavirus last month, while one more said they had ""been diagnosed with presumed coronavirus infection.""
The virus has so far infected more than 378,000 Americans and claimed the lives of more than 11,000 Americans, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University."

For one, the Roman Catholic church, like others around the world, will celebrate its most important day remotely, with Masses and prayers being held over Zoom.
But at St. Gabriel, a critical figure within the parish community will be missing: its beloved pastor, Father Gioacchino Basile. He died as a result of coronavirus on April 4, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn.
""Father Gioacchino was loved by everyone -- everyone in the parish,"" parishioner Florence Soulama told CNN. ""We are heartbroken.""
""He is really a model priest for what we need at this time,"" she said.
This particular time is especially difficult for the St. Gabriel community. Elmhurst has been one of the hardest hit areas of New York City by coronavirus, with more than 764 confirmed cases according to New York City Health Department data. 
Elmhurst Hospital, a 15-minute drive from the parish, quickly became a symbol in the city's fight to control the virus, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying it has ""borne the brunt more than any other hospital in the city"" on April 5. 
Gioacchino was one of six members of the parish community to test positive for coronavirus, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn.
""Although we have been affected disproportionately as a community by the virus, it has also brought the parish together in a sense"" parishioner Angel Alcántara told CNN. ""These teachings that Father Gioacchino has been giving us for all these years have prepared us for a situation like this.""
Gioacchino was an Italian immigrant, who parishioners say battled health concerns throughout his life. He was ordained in 1995 and was to celebrate his 25th anniversary in the priesthood this year. Almost half of his career was spent at St. Gabriel, according to the Diocese of Brooklyn. 
Gioacchino was a humble, loving priest that united the community of St. Gabriel, parishioners said -- a community reflective of Queens' reputation as New York's most diverse borough. 
When Gioacchino joined the parish, it was split evenly between English and Spanish speakers, according to Alcántara. 
Now, he says a majority of the community is Hispanic, with parishioners from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America. The English speakers hail from a number of different countries, too, with parishioners representing Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago to name a few. Gioacchino was able to unite them all, Alcántara said. 
""Father Gioacchino was effective in bringing all these different groups of parishioners together,"" Alcántara told CNN.
""It was something he was able to achieve, to work with always with God at the center,"" he said. 
Both Soulama and Alcántara said that Gioacchino had deep, lasting impacts on their lives. Soulama described that when she faced a difficult time in her life when her husband was sick, Gioacchino's homilies, which she listened to nearly every morning at daily Mass, brought her peace.
""There is nothing to worry about -- we just have to trust in the Lord, and then everything will be fine, "" she said of his message.
 ""We will overcome it knowing that it's God's will."" 
Separated but still united
This is the attitude that the parish community is bringing to this Easter season -- separated from each other because of social distancing during an especially challenging time. 
The parish community is uniting over Zoom, Skype and even praying together over the phone to celebrate this season. The parishioners will still sing hymns and will listen to readings but will not receive the Eucharist during Catholicism's most solemn holiday. 
""Obviously it's different, but the essence of it is still there,"" Alcántara told CNN, as he was helping to set up for the virtual Easter vigil to take place Saturday evening.
""Even though the doors are locked, people still call each other, pray over the phone,"" Soulama said. ""And we learned that from Father Gioacchino.""
The parishioners are sure that Gioacchino continues to pray for them in heaven. Soulama, who would help set up the church for Mass, shared a message he would tell the family at funerals. 
""He always said to them, Nnever say goodbye, just say see you,' "" Soualama said.
And she also shared the message Gioacchino would give at the end of the funeral Mass.
""He would say, 'That's what your loved one wants right now -- for you to love one another,' "" Soualama said."

Here's what you need to know to protect yourself,"As the novel coronavirus sweeps the globe, people with high blood pressure are among those who are at heightened risk for more severe complications should they contract Covid-19.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/health/blood-pressure-coronavirus-wellness/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200413170807-01-blood-pressure-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-17T11:17:53Z,"(CNN)As the novel coronavirus sweeps the globe, people with high blood pressure are among those who are at heightened risk for more severe complications should they contract Covid-19.
""If you get an extraordinary viral disease that will damage your lungs, you need a heart that can work with how your body responds to the virus,"" said Dr. Maria Carolina Delgado-Lelievre, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. 
But for those with hypertension, ""Covid will cause a systemic reaction in the body in a patient that already has risk"" because of poor heart health, she said. That means the virus can attack multiple organ systems.
The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report fromFebruary 12 toMarch 28showed that 9% of Covid-19 patients in the United Statesalso self-reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.
High blood pressure is the most common type of heart disease and affects almost half of all American adults, according to the CDC. That's about 108 million Americans living with the condition. 
And because hypertension is more common as people grow older, thatmeans many of the same people with high blood pressure already overlap with the elderly populations
 known to be at higher risk for contracting Covid-19.
Recognize the warning signs and know how to take your blood pressure
At a basic anatomic level, hypertension happens when there's an abnormality in blood vessels that can impair the way oxygen is transferred to the cells.
Having a low blood oxygen level is common among those hospitalized with Covid-19, according to a study of patients in Wuhan, China published in the Lancet in January.
""High blood pressure is not [just]a number. The number is a guide, it's a symbol,"" Delgado-Lelievre said. ""It's telling us your vessels all over the body are not working as they should.""
High blood pressure may not come with noticeable symptoms, so the best way to identify it is to simply do a blood pressure reading.
To do that, first make sure you have a blood pressure cuff. Today's technology is accurate enough that using a digital wrist cuff can get a good blood pressure reading, Delgado-Lelievre said. 
Next, rest in a sturdy chair for at least five minutes, making sure to sit with your back straight.Keep your forearms supported on a flat surface such as a table, and keep the blood pressure cuff placed directly above where your elbow bends. 
As you're monitoring blood pressure over time, make sure to take the readings at the same time every day.
Any blood pressure reading of 120 over 80 is considered elevated, Delgado-Lelievre said.
Moving up from that point, the first level of hypertension is defined as 130 or higher for systolic (the top number) and 80 or higher for diastolic (the lower number), according to the American Heart Association.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep taking your medicine 
During the pandemic, the best way those with hypertension can manage their own risk is to follow the same guidelines as everyone else:maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and refrain from touching one's face.
More specific to high blood pressure, it's important to try to relax as much as possible, as stress commonly drives up readings. 
With so much of society upended by social distancing and the threat of more infections, relaxing is obviously easier said than done. But do as well as you can to try to keepyour blood pressure at a healthy level.
Although hypertension is a genetic disease, it has external drivers such as lifestyle, diet and exercise.
Delgado-Lelievre said she often tells patients that if they come up with an unusually high blood pressure reading they should try relaxation exercises, or lie down and listen to music. Then they should take their blood pressure again, and they will likely see a drop.
""Some people already know they have hypertension and know they need to monitor their blood pressure two or three times a week,"" she added.
And despite some recent rumors to the contrary, doctors still recommend taking medications your doctor may have prescribed for blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the American Heart Association says.
""Do not stop your medications unless your doctor tells you to,"" Delgado-Lelievre said.
The African American community is at higher risk
It's not just adults over 60; African Americans are also at a higher risk for hypertension, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. 
US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" that he has high blood pressure, noting ""I have heart disease, and I and many black Americans are at higher risk for Covid,"" he said. 
CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Adams. 
""All the doctors are saying: people who have high blood pressure and hypertension are very at risk to dying when they get this virus,"" Jones said. ""Nobody is saying that to the black community loudly enough.""
For groups more likely to have co-morbid conditions or other risk factors, including African Americans and the elderly, Jones had blunt advice. 
""What that means is if your grandmother has high blood pressure or diabetes, grab her and pull her into the house and do not let her out for two months,"" he said.
""Those with hypertension have to be very cautious about maintaining the quarantine,"" Delgado-Lelievre added."

Because of all that, search results on the App Store show few apps related to the virus. The top result is a Brazilian government app about the outbreak, along with a wallpaper app, a Plague Inc-like game, an app from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a COVID-19 information app published by a medical developer.
A search on Google Play, by contrast, shows ""no results found for 'coronavirus',"" with the same message on a search for COVID-19. Google has yet to comment (we've reached out), but does have policies against apps that ""lack reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic events"" or ""profit from a tragic event with no discernible benefit to the victims.""
Google did publish a website called ""Coronavirus: Stay informed,"" with a list including apps from the Red Cross, Center for Disease Control (CDC) news organizations and Twitter(!). However, that page doesn't come up in a Play Store search for coronavirus.
Google doesn't seem to be completely banning independent apps with coronavirus info, CNBC notes. A top Android app called Corona 100m that maps COVID-19 (the diseased caused by the coronavirus) in South Korea is still available, for example.
Technology companies have been fairly proactive about fighting coronavirus misinformation. Facebook and Google are removing false coronavirus content (including bogus cures), and Facebooks is running free WHO ads to counter inaccuracies. Twitter has also banned coronavirus misinformation and Pinterest created a custom search experience to ensure users get reliable information. However, scams, cures and gouging still abound. Amazon in particular is trying to stay on top of product listings that claim to provide coronavirus cures, or are massively overcharging for hand sanitizer, face masks and other health-related items."

The dog was quarantined in an animal center after getting a ""weak positive"" result in a test for the disease COVID-19.
However, the dog has not shown any symptoms of the virus, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Friday.
The spokesman said the dog belongs to a patient infected with the virus.
A low level of the virus was found in the dog's nasal and oral cavities, and officials will now run more tests to see if the dog is actually sick.
The other possibility is that the test results are the result of ""environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose.""

Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, the head of the communicable disease branch of Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said that health authorities would review the entire list of confirmed infected patients in the city and determine if any had pets that would needed to be tested, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported. 
But both Hong Kong officials and global health experts say that there is no evidence to suggest pets can get infected or can spread the virus to humans.
The spokesman said on Friday: ""At present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected with COVID-19 virus or can be a source of infection to people.""
The World Health Organization also said: ""At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.""

The AFCD said that the dog in question is the only dog quarantined at a facility in a Hong Kong port, and that ""staff of the department will step up cleansing and disinfection of the animal keeping facility.""
The statement said that pet owners should ""maintain a good habit of hygiene, and wash their hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol sanitizer after contacting pets. Pet owners shall wear masks while going out.""
""If there are any changes in the health condition of the pets, advice from veterinarians should be sought as soon as possible.""
Some regions have started taking action against the animals despite health officials stating that there is not evidence that cats and dogs can infect humans.
Reuters reported that authorities in Moscow, Russia, have rounded up stray animals and exterminated rats in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. Animal rights groups have criticized the move.

In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, some people have been putting masks on their dogs.
The city of around 11 million people has been under lockdown for more than a month. Thousands of pets there have been abandoned because their owners are quarantined or unable to return to the city.
Some volunteer groups are breaking into apartments to feed pets at their owners' requests, but they say they are overwhelmed by the number of pets in the city.

The US could invoke a 1950s-era law that would allow the government to ramp up the production of gear to combat the spread of the coronavirus, a senior administration official and a congressional aide familiar with the matter said Friday.  
The Trump administration is exploring the potential use of the Defense Production Act to increase the domestic availability of protective masks and clothing, according to the officials, but no final decision has been made. 
""A lot of things are under discussion,"" the administration official told Business Insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
The proposal to invoke the law, which was first reported by Reuters, gives the president the broad authority over industrial output in the name of national security. 
It comes days after the Centers for Disease Control warned the respiratory illness COVID-19 would almost certainly hit communities in the US. The novel coronavirus has spread outside of its epicenter in China to more than four dozen countries, raising concerns among governments and health officials about the potential for a pandemic. 
The White House referred questions on the proposal to the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who was tapped on Wednesday to lead the government response to the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesperson at the Department of Health and Human Services said it would ""not comment on internal deliberations."" The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.
The Defense Production Act, which was passed in response to the Korean War, authorizes the president to take actions to ""force private industry to give priority to defense and homeland security contracts and to allocate the resources needed,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. 
It could be implemented through company contract requirements and various financial measures including loans and purchase commitments. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has prompted nations to roll out restrictions on travel and commerce, raising concerns about disruptions to supply chains and broader business operations. 
Honeywell International, one of the largest producers of face masks, said it has experienced a surge in demand for protective gear in recent weeks and that it was open to coordination with the US government. 
""We are increasing production at multiple facilities globally to address the growing demand,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. ""We are ready and willing to partner with the US government to support national response efforts."" 
Congressional appropriators plan to soon unveil an emergency funding to address the coronavirus outbreak. The White House initially requested a $2.5 billion package that diverted some money from other federal accounts, but Trump has since signaled he was open to the $8 billion Democrats said was necessary. 
HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday the nation may need 300 million N95 masks, used by health workers with direct exposure to airborne infections. The government currently has about 30 million of the respirators in an emergency stockpile, he said."

Over the past month, seemingly spontaneous protest sites have popped up throughout the country that advocate for an end to lockdowns various states have mandated in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Now, security researchers have tied much of this seemingly grass-roots activity to a single person.
Aaron Dorr is a well-known activist and lobbyist who has long been known for his advocacy of firearms ownership. Over a five-hour span on April 8, he registered six domainsreopenohio.com, reopenpa.com, reopenmn.com, reopeniowa.com, reopenwyoming.com, and reopenmissouri.comand nine days later purchased reopentxnow.com.
He and his brothers then used a variety of state-specific Facebook groups, which according the the Des Moines Register have a total of more than 200,000 followers, to drive massive amounts of traffic to the newly registered addresses. In turn, the domains redirected visitors to a host of state-specific gun advocacy sites, such as Iowa Gun Owners. Each gun ownership site used a different organization name and prominently displayed banners decrying the lockdowns in their respective states.
The various groups seemed loosely affiliated and seem to be run by different people in each state, but tie back to a Mr. Aaron Dorr, researchers with Internet analysis tool provider DomainTools wrote in an analysis published on Friday. As we looked further we would find that this is more of a small groups astroturfing effort.
At least 13 of the firearms coalition sites are maintained with website tools provided by One Click Politics, which describes itself as a nonpartisan online advocacy site. The tools allow a single person to create and manage content, run email campaigns, and raise money on multiple sites. All of the sites also use the WordPress content management system that are set up in a similar manner and often carry almost identical language. Although the sites domain registrants were obscured through a proxy service, it appeared all of the sites were run by the same person or entity.
Then the DomainTools researchers found something else. The site at iowagunowners.org, a domain that was registered in 2007, listed a contact phone number that was included in an Iowa state lobbyist report completed by Dorr. The researchers also discovered that historical HTTPS certificates for all of the sites referenced Dorrs personal site, as well as gun coalitions in other states.
Another similarity among the gun ownership sites: they all use a donate button provided by Anedot, a donation site for churches, charities and non-profit organizations. Almost all of the configurations for the buttons are identical.
We can say that these initial domains and the campaign behind them are definitely a small group-run astroturfing effort and that the Dorrs plan to continue operating these nation-wide campaigns, the DomainTools report said.
Friday's report came four days after KrebsOnSecurity also linked several of the sites to Dorr. Reporter Brian Krebs said that at least two of the gun ownership sites included the same Google Analytics tracker in their source code. The same tracker was present on reopentexasnow.com, reopenwi.com, reopeniowa.com and several anti-gun control sites registered to the Dorr brothers.
Dorr declined to answer questions for this post or to provide a statement. A text message he sent me contained a link the the previously mentioned Des Moines Register article. The article quotes Dorr saying: This virus has claimed the lives of (0.002%) of the states population, while sending over 160,000 Iowans into horrific financial devastation. Our members asked for a vehicle with which to make their voices heard, and we are happy to give them that voice."""

Effectively, Dyson may have been “point-scoring” for publicity’s sake, promising a giant order even though it needed regulatory approval to move forward.
As Dyson said, this doesn’t mean CoVent is gone. Countries hit harder by COVID-19, such as the US, might still need it. And a lack of demand is clearly a good thing at a time when many are still worried that hospitals could be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. However, the decision to put manufacturing on hold may hurt Dyson’s reputation. This comes just months after company scrapped its electric car project in the fall — it’s not having much success outside of core categories like vacuum cleaners and hair dryers."

One of the more frustrating aspects of the coronavirus pandemic has been the amount of disinformation swirling about. Much of this is politically motivated, perhaps unsurprising with the attention given to President Donald Trump's rambling, error-strewn press conferences. It may seem like commonsense that actively misleading the public during a national emergency has consequences, but now Fox News' two most-watched hosts have unwittingly performed a rather elegant experiment on their viewers that allows us to quantify that effect. The results are stark: greater exposure to Sean Hannity versus Tucker Carlson shows a measurable increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths throughout March and early April.
Hannity and Carlson are Fox News' two biggest stars, each commanding around 4 million viewers for their respective evening shows (Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight). While often it can be hard to see daylight between their ideological pronouncements on-air, in early 2020, the two had markedly different lines on the coronavirus outbreak. Carlson began regularly covering the virus in January. During February, he did so with a growing sense of alarm that the United States could experience a heavy death tollthe same month that saw much inaction on the part of the federal government.By contrast, Hannity gave the virus almost no attention in February. And when he began to discuss the virus at the same frequency as Carlson during the first two weeks of March, it was to minimize the threat compared to the number of annual deaths attributable to car crashes, shootings, or seasonal influenza. Additionally, Hannity also accused the Democratic Party of exaggerating the threat as a way of attacking the president. However, by mid-March, Hannity changed his tune once President Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency.
The study comes from a group of researchers led by the University of Chicago's Leonardo Bursztyn and uses survey data gathered in April from 1,045 regular viewers of Fox News (aged 55 and over) to examine the timing of behavioral changes in response to the viruswhen people began to cancel travel, isolate, increase the frequency of hand-washing, and so on.
The results are striking. Survey participants who preferred watching Carlson began changing their behavior on average three days earlier than other Fox News viewers. Meanwhile, participants who preferred Hannity acted much laterfive days after other Fox News viewers, and eight days after Carlson viewers.
Next, the authors examined the data at a more granular level to determine whether there were local differences in the rate of COVID-19 infections or deaths in areas that watched more Hannity versus Carlson. They found that:
[C]ontrolling for a rich set of county-level demographics (including the local market share of Fox News), greater local viewership of Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is associated with a greater number of COVID-19 cases starting in early March and a greater number of deaths resulting from COVID-19 starting in mid-March. In a set of permutation tests across socio-economic, demographic, political, and health-related covariates, as well as across geographical fixed effects to account for unobservable factors, we show that the established relationship is highly robust. Indeed, the estimated effects of exposure become stronger as we control for more factors.
The study then goes on to tease out whether there could be another reason for this correlation. For instance, could local sunset times affect the data? (Or, as the paper explains, ""if people like to turn on their TVs to watch something when Hannity happens to be on instead of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the likelihood that viewers are shifted to watch Hannity is disproportionately large in areas where Fox News is popular in general."") But the effect remains. As viewership of Hannity increases compared to Carlson, there's a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in mid-March, which begins to decline later in the month as the two hosts' messages on coronavirus converge.
By this point, it's a safe assumption that some of you are screaming at your screens that the authors are idiots, because correlation isn't causation. But the study is well-controlled for other variablesfor example, how rural an area is, how far it is from Seattle, or differential rates of health insurancethat could affect the local spread of COVID-19. For example, geography or rates of health insurance or educational attainment at the county level could explain these results. On top of that, the study builds on previous (recent) work that has shown that there are partisan differences in how people respond to emergenciesareas that saw more votes for Trump have lower hurricane-evacuation rates, for example, as well as GPS data that shows less social distancing in areas that watch greater amounts of Fox News.
Whether Fox News planned to conduct this experiment or not, it does elegantly show that dis- or misinformation during a public health emergency costs lives."

After much political to-ing and fro-ing, it seems everyone is now on the same page: people should wear face masks in public while the coronavirus pandemic rages. A mask might not stop you from getting sick, but it may well prevent you from infecting other people. But what happens if you need to wear a face mask while operating a machine that depends upon seeing your face? I am of course referring to fleet drivers who drive vehicles with vision-based driver monitoring systems (DMSes), and the answer is ""you need to update your DMS to work with face masks."" Which is exactly what Israeli company Eyesight Technologies has done.
A lot of the focus on DMSes has been for passenger vehicles in relation to partly automated driver aids like GM's Super Cruise (which uses gaze-tracking to ensure the driver is looking at the road ahead as a condition for operation) or Tesla's Autopilot (which has been repeatedly criticized by federal safety agencies for failing to do the same).
But a DMS isn't just a good idea for a hands-free driving aid; people can and do get distracted in plain-old regular cars, too. Which is why automakers like Subaru and Mazda equip their vehicles with camera-based DMSes here in the US and abroad.Convincing individual drivers that a safety option is worth ticking when buying a new car is one thing, but like telematics that monitor a vehicle's health and its driver's behavior, it's a different story when we're talking about fleets of commercial vehicles. And it's this application that Eyesight's system is aimed at. It sells an aftermarket system called FleetSense that watches a number of facial features like a driver's mouth, eyes, eyelids, and head pose to detect when that driver isn't paying attention to the road or is falling asleep. But the algorithm doesn't like it when it can't recognize all those facial featureslike when someone is wearing a mask, for instance.
With the prospect of China restarting its economy in the coming months, the company has reworked its software so that a driver wearing a mask won't defeat the DMS, and it's beginning the process of rolling the updated software out to its clients, including one at the center of the pandemic. And maybe here in the US, too:
""Exsun is a telematics service provider in Wuhan, China supporting hundreds of thousands of trucks,"" Eyesight VP of product Tal Krzypow told me by email. ""They are a customer of Eyesight Technologies and will be rolling out Fleet Sense, our aftermarket driver monitoring system for fleets, in the coming months. We expect their drivers to continue wearing masks as the city gets back to work. We are working with similar telematic/ fleet service providers in the US. Unfortunately, we cannot mention them by name as they have not yet announced the news."""

19 with 17 posters participating
The Trump administration is threatening to sue states and municipalities whose pandemic orders infringe on people's rights or cause ""undue interference with the national economy.""
""I am directing each of our United States Attorneys to also be on the lookout for state and local directives that could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens,"" US Attorney General William Barr wrote yesterday in a memo to all 94 US attorneys' offices. The Barr memo said that ""even in times of emergency, when reasonable and temporary restrictions are placed on rights, the First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers."" The memo is available at The Washington Post website.
Barr's memo is not just aimed at protecting members of religious groups. He continued:
The legal restrictions on state and local authority are not limited to discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers. For example, the Constitution also forbids, in certain circumstances, discrimination against disfavored speech and undue interference with the national economy. If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court.
Barr wrote that he is ""therefore directing the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and Matthew Schneider, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, to oversee and coordinate our efforts to monitor state and local policies and, if necessary, take action to correct them."" While Barr said US officials ""do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,"" he noted that ""the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.""
Disturbingly close to house arrest
The memo did not detail what kinds of restrictions would cause the United States to sue states or cities, and it did not say whether the US will challenge any measures that are already in place. But Barr wrote that local restrictions, while ""necessary in order to stop the spread of a deadly disease,"" have ""imposed tremendous burdens on the daily lives of all Americans.""
Barr previously criticized local policies in interviews, saying that ""the idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest,"" according to a Fox News article last week. ""We're looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,"" Barr said. ""And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they're not and people bring lawsuits, we file [a] statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.""
The Justice Department has so far ""intervened in only a single lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions, appearing to back a Greenville, Miss., church which had sued over the city's efforts to shut down drive-in religious services,"" The Washington Post wrote. The Justice Department ""did not unequivocally support Temple Baptist Church in its legal statement of interest, though it said the circumstances the church described 'suggest that the city singled out churches for distinctive treatment,' which would be unconstitutional.""
Trump threatened states
President Trump on April 13 claimed he has ""total"" authority to override governors and force states to reopen their economies even while the coronavirus pandemic continues. ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be. It's total, and the governors know that,"" Trump said at a press conference.
That isn't how it works, as states and local governments have police powers to protect the health and safety of residents with measures such as isolation and quarantines. But Trump's claim and related developments showed that at least some states aren't likely to succumb to federal pressure to reopen their economies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would not follow a presidential order requiring him to lift pandemic orders. Shortly before Trump's claim, coalitions of governors on the East and West Coasts announced pacts to follow science, not politics, in their decisions on when to reopen economies.
Trump backed down just one day later, saying ""I'm not going to put pressure on any governor to open."" However, Barr's letter signals that the Trump administration is not done pressuring states to lift pandemic orders."

New York Attorney General Letitia James hasn't been impressed with Amazon's response to the coronavirus crisis.
""While we continue to investigate, the information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon's health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,"" James' staff wrote in an April 22 letter first obtained by National Public Radio.
The crisis has produced surging demand for Amazon's delivery services. But as Amazon has hired an extra 175,000 people to help fill orders, it has also faced criticism about its safety practices. Last month, a number of workers (Amazon counted 15, organizers claimed 60) protested outside a massive Amazon fulfillment center on Staten Island. Amazon has also seen sporadic online protests in recent weeks.
The Staten Island protesters wanted their facility shut down for a deep cleaning. Amazon workers have also called for universal paid sick leave and stronger efforts to keep workers separated during work hours.
But Amazon says that it is doing everything it can to protect its workers from the coronavirus.
""We made over 150 process updatesfrom enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like disinfectant spraying,"" a spokeswoman told Ars by email. ""We distributed personal protective gear, such as masks for our employees, and implemented disinfectant spraying and temperature checks across our operations worldwide.""
In their letter, New York officials also questioned Amazon's decision to fire Chris Smalls, one of the organizers of the Staten Island protest. Smalls accused Amazon of retaliating against him for his organizing efforts. Amazon insists that Smalls was fired for defying a stay-at-home order after he came into contact with an infected co-worker.
James' office writes that their findings so far ""raise serious concern that Amazon may have discharged [Smalls] in order to silence his complaints and send a threatening message to other employees that they should also keep quiet about any health and safety concerns.""
""This Office has learned that many workers are fearful about speaking out about their concerns following the termination of Mr. Smalls' employment,"" the letter added. ""This is a particularly dangerous message to send during a pandemic, when chilling worker speech about health and safety practices could literally be a matter of life and death.""
But Amazon says it has done nothing wrong.
""We did not terminate Mr. Smalls employment for organizing a 15-person protest,"" Amazon said by email. ""We terminated his employment for putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of his employment. Mr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.""
Amazon says Smalls was instructed to stay home for 14 days after he came into contact with a coworker who had COVID-19 and that Smalls came to work anyway to help lead the protest.
Whatever the reasons for Smalls' termination, a leaked internal memo suggests that Amazon may have had a deliberate strategy to make him the face of worker organizing at Amazon.
Hes not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how were trying to protect workers, Amazon's general counsel wrote."

Cloud-connected, ""smart"" automated pet-feeder system Petnet has had a rough spring. The service not only went offline in February, but all its customer service vanished, too, leaving users in the dark until the company apologized and pushed a patch more than a week later. The service briefly returned for some users, but fell off again in March. Now, after weeks of silence, the company is blaming COVID-19 for driving it offline for goodeven though its problems started weeks or months before the novel coronavirus became a significant concern.
Several Petnet customers began reaching out to Ars during the second and third weeks of April to report that, once again, not only were their feeders not working, but also they couldn't reach anyone at Petnet about it. Everyone's feeders didn't go offline at the same time but seemed to fail in slow sequence over the period between March 26 and April 13.
The company emailed its customers on March 26 blaming the novel coronavirus for outages and delays. The message, titled, ""Petnet: Impact of COVID-19,"" read:
Dear Petnet Customers,
The purpose of this outreach is to let you know how the COVID-19 crisis is impacting Petnet operations and your SmartFeeder usage. We work with a wide range of vendors, from other start up companies to well known establishments, to help provide convenience through a series of connected services.
One of our third party vendors has notified us that due to COVID-19 their operations are experiencing an adverse effect. We will monitor this situation closely and provide you with any updates as they arise.
Our service center is experiencing higher than normal ticket volumes, so our response time may take longer than usual. Thank you for your patience and for your understanding during this challenging time.
Best Regards,
The Petnet Team
The message to customers listed the same email (support@petnet.io) and Twitter (@petnetiosupport) handles the company has always used, but every reader who wrote to Ars said they were unable to receive support through either. The company tweeted on April 13 that it was experiencing ""a service disruption"" affecting both its first- and second-generation smart feeders. On April 14, Petnet posted another Tweet saying, ""We are still experiencing SmartFeeder connection downtime due to an ongoing service disruption that is currently being investigated."" As of April 27, that remains the company's last tweet.
Users looking for support received messages directing them to a third-party site called Tier One Success. Tier One bills itself as ""simplified customer support to help meet your Smart Home needs,"" but it appears to have almost no online presence outside of the link sent to Petnet device owners. Its only external communication is a Twitter account with 16 followers. The last time any message was posted to that account, in July 2019, Tier One indicated that it exclusively supported Petnet products and had not yet expanded to customer support for any other smart home device. 
Tier One at one time did post an open job listing on another site which described the firm as an ""in-house customer success team"" for Petnet. A LinkedIn bio for the person listed as the founder of Tier One, Joshua Bullock, is, to put it mildly, bare-bones and uninformative.
All complaints, however, whether addressed to Petnet directly or made through the Tier One support form, seemed to disappear into the ether. By April 16, all of the new customer reviews on Petnet's Amazon product listing were surmising the company had gone out of business, as were many tweets to @petnetiosupport and many reader emails to us.
Messages sent to email addresses posted by the company bounced back, as they had during the February outage as well. Ars was able to track down a working email address for a Petnet employee on April 23 and sent a message asking if the company was still operational.
Though the message was sent to a personal email address, the reply read, ""Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience our customers are experiencing right now"" and directed us to contact Petnet CEO Carlos Herrera, providing a phone number.
A few hours later, Petnet users began receiving an email explaining that the company was, more or less, going out of business. Several forwarded their copies to Ars.
""Last week on April 14, 2020, we briefed all of our customers regarding one of our third-party connected vendor's inability to fully resource their company and stay functionally online,"" the message reads. ""As of this writing, this situation remains unresolved but we are confident it will be overcome soon.""
But due to the exceptional circumstances the COVID-19 pandemic has created, Petnet went on, many of its vendorslargely startups like itselfwere ""severely and negatively affected in their day to day operations."" In short: the funding dried up. Due to a lack of funds, Petnet said, it ""re-prioritized and reorganized [its] resources,"" including:

The popular app outlined some new coronavirus-related policies in a Monday press release. Starting in May, Airbnb will strongly encourage hosts to sanitize rooms after visitors leave using new, comprehensive cleaning guidelines. In addition to that, hosts will have to leave at least 24 hours between one visitor leaving and another one coming in.
These new cleaning guidelines, geared toward Covid-19 prevention, recommend masks, gloves, and specific disinfectants. Hosts can enroll in the cleaning protocol program and get certified, which will show up on their Airbnb profiles. In other words, you'll know if a host has adopted the new cleaning standards.

According to Airbnb's press release, hosts can choose not to commit to these guidelines. But they'll need a 72-hour buffer between guests. 
Airbnb hosts had to cancel and refund bookings once the coronavirus pandemic started, hemorrhaging money in the process. The company set up a fund to offer some relief to those hosts, and these new policies could potentially bring some of that lost business back.
One could argue strenuous cleaning standards should have existed before the pandemic. But once people feel comfortable traveling again, they can at least get the peace of mind that comes from a sanitized bedroom."

Rony Abovitz, Magic Leap's Chief Executive Officer, confirmed the news following an earlier Bloomberg report that stated the augmented reality startup was ""cutting half its workforce.""
According to sources close to the matter, that's about 1,000 employees. 
Abovitz took to Magic Leap's site to express the news in a blog post, citing COVID-19 as the reason for a company-wide restructuring. 
""To better prepare Magic Leap for the future, we have taken a close look at our business and are making targeted changes to how we operate and manage costs. This has made it necessary for us to make the incredibly difficult decision to lay off a number of employees across Magic Leap,"" he said in the statement. 
This doesn't come as much of a surprise considering that, back in December, it was reported the company's sales numbers were way worse than expected. 
According to The Information, the company only sold 6,000 headsets out of its target goal of 100,000. 
Sure, Magic Leap came back and said the report was inaccurate, but the company didn't provide any metrics to prove the numbers were wrong either.
At least this time around, the startup is being a bit more transparent when it comes to its current status and the future of the company.
So, what is next for Magic Leap after all this? 
For starters, the company has decided to concentrate strictly on the enterprise side of things rather than consumer. And, they're also going to continue to work on a ... second-generation Magic Leap.
Clearly, not even a pandemic can stop them from trying to get this thing right. 
""Adapting our company to these new market realities and our increased focus on enterprise means we must align our efforts to focus on the areas of our business that advance our technology, ensure delivery of Magic Leap 2, and expand product-market fit and revenue generation,"" Abovitz expressed later in the blog post.
Given the reactions to the first Magic Leap, let's hope that ""increased focus"" also includes a design revamp for its next AR headset. Because everyone's right, it's ugly."

Researchers now suggest that a combination of cotton with natural silk or chiffon (yes, the material many nighties are made out of) could effectively filter out airborne particles. Since the coronavirus can be spread through respiratory droplets say when an infected person coughs or sneezes University of Chicago professor Supratik Guha and his fellow researchers set out to determine which readily available materials best filter out the droplets. 
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus sparks black market filled with fake and stolen N95 face masks
In an article published by the American Chemical Society, the researchers explained how they came to their conclusion. After producing particles in an aerosol mixing chamber, they used fans to blow the particles at different fabrics at the same rate a human would at rest. They then measured the size of the particles before and after passing through the fabrics. 
As it turns out, one layer of tightly-woven cotton combined with two layers of polyester-spandex chiffon filtered out around 80 to 99 percent of particles, making it the most effective. The researchers also got similar results substituting the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, as well as using a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester batting.
These results are comparable to the effectiveness of N95 mask material, but Guha and his team also emphasized the need for masks to fit correctly. Just a one-percent gap can reduce the mask's efficiency by half, or more.

What if, they ask, I already had COVID-19 weeks ago but didn't realize or couldn't confirm it? 
The search terms ""did I have coronavirus"" spiked in Google Trends early last month, when it became clear the United States was on the cusp of major outbreaks. People also Googled ""did I have coronavirus in January"" and ""did I have coronavirus in February."" 
Soccer star Carli Lloyd wondered as much on Twitter in late March, detailing symptoms similar to those caused by COVID-19, including a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. 
""Beginning to think my husband and I had the Coronavirus back in mid February,"" she wrote. ""A sickness we have never felt before."" 
Her replies were full of people wondering about the same scenario in their lives. 
It's a simultaneously compelling, legitimate thing to ask and a kind of fantasy that we might indulge in because the alternative constantly worrying about contracting a highly infectious fatal disease is exhausting. The anxiety of extreme social distancing and panic buying might be more tolerable if people knew they'd already survived asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases of COVID-19.  
SEE ALSO: Wearing a coronavirus face mask isn't about you
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is elusive, which means, as far as we know, the risk of contracting COVID-19 remains high. This is particularly true because people who are asymptomatic can infect others, undermining a key assumption about how viruses are transmitted. 
There are now more than 370,000 known cases and 12,000 fatalities in the U.S., and public health authorities stress that the only way to stem infections and prevent more deaths is to continue practicing social distancing, hand washing, and other preventive measures. 
In order to know how many people in the U.S. have been infected with COVID-19, we'd need widespread availability of highly accurate tests that detect the presence of antibodies against the disease. We also need more scientific information about how long immunity to the disease lasts once someone acquires it. Immunity to common colds, which are caused by coronaviruses, is temporary. Even if someone accurately suspected they'd come down with COVID-19 earlier this year, it doesn't necessarily mean they'd continue to be immune to the virus in the coming months or years. 
Then there's the question of whether the timeline makes sense. Prior to the known outbreaks, could people have developed mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 without a simultaneous uptick in severe cases that would've required hospitalization? 
Nicholas Reich, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst whose lab focuses on understanding and modeling infectious disease, has been looking for evidence of this happening, and so far sees little data to support that possibility. 
For the last two months, @cmyeaton and I have been leading a weekly analysis of publicly available influenza-like illness (ILI) data and flu test results from the @CDCFlu and state health departments. https://t.co/KrqgiKoyxE1/
 Nicholas G. Reich (@reichlab) March 27, 2020
He and his lab members noticed influenza-like illnesses increase in December and January and thought perhaps coronavirus had been silently circulating for months. They decided to look at the rate of influenza-like illnesses alongside the rate of negative flu tests as a potential signal of community spread of COVID-19; if illnesses rose but more flu tests came back negative, it could suggest another pathogen playing an unexpected role. By late February, the lab's analysis showed trends that were consistent with historical norms. 
Since then, when the lab looked at patterns in March, they saw deviations from the historical norms but it was difficult to draw strong conclusions from that data. 
More people went to the doctor with respiratory illnesses and also tested negative for the flu, but Reich said that could be the result of people changing their behavior as media coverage of coronavirus ramped up. In other words, more people sought medical attention for various symptoms because of alarming headlines about COVID-19 but may not have had the disease. The researchers couldn't rule out COVID-19 spreading earlier than thought, but the data also suggested that if the coronavirus had been present, it would've been relatively limited. 
Reich believes it's plausible that someone in the vicinity of a hot spot like Seattle or New York could've developed COVID-19 in mid-February, as the disease began to spread throughout communities. 
""Outbreaks like this take time to build up steam and really start to burn,"" he said. 
Still, given the severity of COVID-19, Reich believes it's unlikely that coronavirus was widespread prior to late February and early March. That would've been accompanied by what we're seeing now, and saw in Italy: a fraction of patients streaming into emergency rooms with respiratory distress. 
""Outbreaks like this take time to build up steam and really start to burn.""
""Based on everything thats been coming out, Ive been increasingly feeling as though it wouldve been really hard to miss a large outbreak,"" said Reich. ""Data points like [what's happening in Italy] make it clearer to me just how this is really different from seasonal flu."" 
Reich also points to genomic analyses of the coronavirus conducted by Trevor Bedford
, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which suggest
 that the first known
 COVID-19 case in the U.S. occurred in mid-January, in Washington state. That research  looked at minor mutations in the virus' genome to analyze when it might have emerged in the U.S.  If that analysis is accurate, it would make it far less likely that the disease caused mysterious respiratory illnesses in late 2019 or early 2020. 
Ruth Collins, an associate professor of molecular medicine at Cornell University, said it's very likely that a different, nasty virus could've been circulating this winter. Since the symptoms caused by coronaviruses overlap significantly, it would make sense that some people experienced an awful illness that wasn't actually caused by COVID-19 but still produced similar symptoms like coughing, fever, and aches and pains. 
Collins said that wondering about whether an illness experienced prior to the coronavirus outbreak was in fact COVID-19 is a form of highly relatable wishful thinking. 
""It's part of human psychology,"" she said. ""We always want to think were better than we are, that we got lucky, that we escaped it somehow."" 
It doesn't help, either, that tests to diagnose COVID-19 have been difficult to get. 
In the absence of diagnostic testing, we need widespread individual and epidemiological testing to determine who contracted COVID-19 and developed antibodies to the disease. That requires highly accurate serology tests, or blood-based tests, that detect the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Such testing is being rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the government agency is focusing on areas that became hot spots. Antibody tests are not widely available, and though there are efforts to make them accessible to the public, it's not clear when they will be.  
Collins also said that antibody tests, like any other test, can be unreliable, producing both false negatives and false positives. Tests, for example, might not pick up antibodies present in small amounts because immunity declined, even if the person was infected. 
What we need is more conclusive medical and scientific research on how COVID-19 is transmitted, particularly through asymptomatic people, and a more precise tally of how many people have been infected. Individual access to accurate antibody tests will be important to answering the lingering question about potential infection, but it's still unclear how long immunity lasts.  
In the meantime, suspicion of a COVID-19 infection without confirmation is no reason to relax social distancing or hygiene practices. 
""This thing is not going to go away fast,"" said Collins. ""Weve got to know more about how the disease spreads. The idea of testing will give some level of confidence, but it wont be enough until we know more about how the disease is transmitted."""

She was determined to be a voice for her patients through silence.
Leander, a Banner Health nurse of five years, joined an intimate group of healthcare workers on Monday to counter protest at the Capitol, where people gathered to urge the governor to reopen the state.
Standing up straight, her arms crossed and face mask on, Leander stood on the Capitol steps, with a handful of healthcare workers lined up by her side. She said she only spoke if someone encroached on her personal space, despite people raising their voices at her.
""It was heated, people were very fired up about what they had to say,"" she said. ""A lot of the top comments we got were about us being fake nurses, there was a huge majority of them that still believe this virus is fake, that it's a hoax and not real at all. They were convinced that we're fake nurses and that's why we weren't talking."" 
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has put a stay-at-home order in place until April 30. Because of this, several different groups of rallied at the Capitol to say the economy has suffered enough and the order needs to be lifted, according to CNN affiliate KNXV.
Leander told CNN she volunteered to work in the hospital's Covid-19 unit full time and has been seeing patients from all over the state for the last month.
""I just hope people see that nurses are not the enemy and we'll take care of them one way or the other,"" Leander said. ""I don't care if you believe in this virus or not or truly what your opinion is of it, if these people show up in my ICU we will take care of them one way or another.""
After seeing photos and video Sunday of people at a rally in Denver, Colorado, demanding the state reopen and ease restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, Leander said she was inspired and wanted to stand up in support of her fellow healthcare workers. 
After seeing a Facebook post about Monday's rally, Leander said she texted a few of her colleagues and headed there.
Leander and the few other nurses, from other hospitals, stood in silence at the ""Patriots' Day Rally"" at the Capitol where nearly 1,000 people gathered, according to KNXV. 
""This isn't about politics, choosing sides, this virus does not discriminate at all,"" she said. ""It's taking lives from one end of the spectrum to another. I know it's wishful thinking but I just would love if we just had that common ground with fighting this virus.""
Leander said right now the public needs to be listening to the experts who are studying this virus. Even as nurses, they're relying on science to guide them. 
""Our main message was that we wanted healthcare workers' voices to be heard louder than misinformation and fear,"" Leander said. ""There will be a calm and controlled manner to reopen our economy and our state...you don't open the flood gates and release everyone at once."" 
Experiencing heartbreaking moments at work
Photos from the rally in Denver caught the attention of many on social media, including former Arizona state Sen. Dr. Kelli Ward, who challenged Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary in 2016.
Ward tweeted Tuesday morning, questioning the authenticity of the healthcare workers who attended and calling the movement propaganda.
""EVEN IF these 'spontaneously' appearing ppl at protests against govt overreach (sporting the same outfits, postures, &amp; facial expressions) ARE involved in healthcare - when they appeared at rallies, they were actors playing parts #Propaganda #FakeOutrage,"" Ward tweeted.
CNN has reached out to Ward for comment.
After hearing about Ward's tweet, Leander said if given the opportunity she would walk her through the ICU at her hospital to the bedside of some of her coronavirus patients to see firsthand the impacts of the virus. 
""I wish she could be in my shoes for a day, I'd have her put on a pair of scrubs and walk with me,"" Leander said. 
Leander has not seen any of her family members since she's been working in the Covid-19 unit. And although that lost time has been tough, what she's been experiencing in the hospital is tougher. 
""A human being having to pass away via FaceTime because their family is not allowed in the hospital during this crisis, it's the most heartbreaking thing you will ever see,"" she said.
A few days ago, Leander said she had a patient grab her hand and say, ""Please tell me I'm not going to die here.""
While Leander knows better days are ahead, she said it doesn't take away from the reality that there are people impacted and suffering right now."

In an effort to ensure the credibility of health and safety information in its App Store, Apple is tightening requirements for all coronavirus-focused apps, TechCrunch reports. The company posted a note on its developer blog Saturday that outlines the review process for apps related to the virus. 
Were evaluating apps critically to ensure data sources are reputable and that developers presenting these apps are from recognized entities such as government organizations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions, the post states. Only developers from one of these recognized entities should submit an app related to COVID-19.
Apple also is banning entertainment apps and games that are COVID-19 or coronavirus-themed, the post states.
Developers should choose the time-sensitive event option when submitting a permissible COVID-19 related app to the App Store to expedite the process, since many are focused on alleviating crisis situations. Membership fees for non-profit organizations and government agencies developing apps related to the pandemic will be waived, according to the post.

Dr. Rick Bright had led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has been central to the response to the coronavirus outbreak, since 2016. But his departure Tuesday, he believes, stems in part from his resistance to efforts to widen the availability of a coronavirus treatment pushed by President Donald Trump. Bright will now lead a public-private partnership on vaccine development and treatment, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN. 
As BARDA's director, Bright oversaw ""the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures against an array of threats to national security and the public's health, including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear threats and pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases,"" according to an archived webpage of his official biography. 
Bright said in a statement issued Wednesday that he believes his transfer was owed to his ""insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit."" He also announced he will file a whistleblower complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general.
While testifying before Congress in 2018 on BARDA's fight against the flu, Bright had touted the effectiveness of his former agency, saying, ""No one can rival BARDA's success in expanding capacity and pushing new products to the marketplace."" 
Prior to serving as director of the agency, Bright, who had been with BARDA since 2010, served as the director of its Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division, ""where he was responsible for preparing the nation for influenza pandemics,"" according to the World Health Organization. 
But Bright, who holds a Ph.D. in immunology and virology from Emory University, has shared his expertise beyond the US, serving as an adviser to the World Health Organization, according to its website, which said he has also advised the US Department of Defense.
The doctor began his career with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to his biography, where he focused on influenza viruses and antiviral drugs, among other things.
Bright has also held a number of stints in the private sector where he worked on vaccine developments, according to the WHO, and is the recipient of the prestigious Charles C. Shepard Science Award for Scientific Excellence."

Two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), have a list of 147 nursing homes where at least one resident has contracted COVID-19. But The Washington Post reports that the agencies are refusing to release this list to the public.
""According to CDC data shared with CMS, 147 nursing homes across 27 states have at least one resident with COVID-19,"" the CMS wrote in the sixth paragraph of a Monday press release about increased nursing home inspections. But when the Post asked the CMS for the list, the agency referred the paper to the CDC. A CDC spokesman told the Post that he was ""not sure"" the list would be ""released at this time.""
""It's terriblepeople have a right to know where this is happening,"" nursing professor Charlene Harrington told the paper. ""These nursing homes should be made public so that people have the option to take people out.""
Nursing homes are a particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic because elderly people are at much higher risk of dying from the coronavirus. It's difficult to quarantine residents in nursing homes because most have staff that care for patients and then return home.
Some nursing homes have publicly announced when residents or staff contract COVID-19. A public announcement allows anyone who lives, works, or visits the facility to take added precautions. It's not clear how many of the 147 facilities on the CDC list have been disclosed publicly.
The Post notes that Florida officials have also come under pressure to release a list of 19 Florida nursing homes with COVID-19 outbreaks. Florida officials have declined to provide the list, citing privacy laws."

As with previous pandemics that attack the lungs, one of the biggest worries about COVID-19 is that we simply won't have enough ventilators to treat critically ill patients. It's a valid concern, based on reports from Italy. The US government has confirmed that the nation has a stockpile of more than 10,000 ventilators, but President Trump also recently told Twitter that it should be the states' responsibility to buy these vital life-saving devices.
Over the past few days, there have been growing calls to mobilize advanced manufacturing industries to meet this need, and on Wednesday night, Elon Musk replied to a fan on twitter that his companies ""will make ventilators if there is a shortage.""
We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2020
However, the rocket and electric car billionaire also used the social media platform to downplay the seriousness of the situation, despite increasingly scary predictions from public health experts that appear to have woken the US government from its complacency.
Over in the UK, where there are fewer than 6,000 ventilators available to its National Health Service, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already called for industrial mobilization. Companies including Rolls-Royce (the jet engine maker, not the car company), Airbus, and Jaguar Land Rover have been asked if they can help address the pending shortage, and blueprints have been sent to more than 60 firms, according to The Guardian.
Meanwhile in Italy, supply chain issues and the lack of a critical part has seen at least one hospital turn to 3D printing to keep the machines running. Since no good deed goes unpunished, the original manufacturer of the vital valvewhich it could not supplyhas threatened to sue the printer."

As the new coronavirus sweeps the US, federal regulators this week began cracking down on companies fraudulently claiming that their products prevent or treat COVID-19.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent joint warning letters to seven companies making false claims.
There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus, FTC Chairperson Joe Simons said in a statement. What we dont need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims.
These warning letters are just the first step, he said. Were prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam.
Collectively, the companies have suggested that colloidal silver, essential oils, herbal tinctures, and teas can prevent or treat COVID-19. As the FDA and FTC point out, they have used a potpourri of terms and pseudoscientific explanations to make their fraudulent claims.
Herbal Amy Inc., for instance, wrote on its website, Corona virus treatment. Stephen Buhner [a self-proclaimed herbal medicine expert] has analyzed how corona viruses infect tissues, what tissues they infect, and the herbs that are useful to interrupt that process, as well as the herbs useful to shut down the cytokine cascade they create.
Herbal Amy sells the three-tincture Buhner Coronavirus Kit for $155 on its website. It is currently said to be sold out on the site.
A company called Xephyr, LLC dba N-Ergetics wrote on its website that its colloidal silver product can treat Coronavirus 2019-NCoVat [sic]... This Chinese Wuhan Flu Pneumonia has a non-traditional remedy that has successfully killed coronaviruses from the flu virus to pandemic diseases, in vitro, for over 100 years.
As the FDA notes, there are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19.
Although there are investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development, these investigational products are in the early stages of product development and have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness, the agency says."

Three New Hampshire residents have sued Gov. Chris Sununu arguing that a ban on gatherings larger than 50 people in the state violates their constitutional rights.
The New Hampshire Union Leader reports that one of the plaintiffs, Eric Couture, attends services three times a week at a Baptist church in Nashua.
""Anyone can choose not to exercise their God-given unalienable rights, Couture said. We can choose not to assemble if that is our desire. What cannot occur is one man in a position of power deciding to strip us of our rights in the name of safety and without due process.
Another plaintiff, former Republican State Representative David W. Binford, said the order would prevent him from attending meetings of the Grafton County Republican Committee.
The AP reports that a judge on Wednesday denied the plaintiffs' request for an immediate injunction against the governor's order. A hearing is scheduled for Friday at the Merrimack County Superior Court.
""A spokesman for Sununu said Thursday that the emergency order is consistent with actions taken across the country and is clearly within the governors authority,"" the AP reports.
New Hampshire has 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Nationally, there are more than 14,000 confirmed casesup from about 100 at the start of the month.
New Hampshire's response to the coronavirus, of course, is not unusual. Across the country, cities, counties, and states have issued orders banning large gatherings, shutting down schools and restaurants, and in some cases ordering people to stay in their homes aside from a few essential activities."

Influential, an influencer marketing and social data firm, is behind the push.
""As weve all seen in the media, Gen Z and Millennials need to take this to heart.

The post from Knox the text of which was shared with Mashable ahead of posting highlights WHO's good work and will direct followers to a link for donations. Knox also advises: ""DONT FORGET, keep social distancing and washing your hands.""
For its part, WHO has said it appreciates that groups with large audiences are reaching out to help fight the pandemic. 
In general, the World Health Organization has received a lot of support from media organizations around the world to share accurate information and advice to protect themselves from coronavirus, said Paul Garwood, acting head of the leadership unit at WHOs Department of Communication."

She even launched an effort called Infinite Screen Time to dismantle the guilt parents feel about the devices in our kids hands.
But on week four of her kids virtual learning after their Hong Kong schools closed in January, Kim started fretting about the hours they were spending on technology for school, which runs from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then free time. 
Youre seeing your child on the screen so much, and its, even for the Infinite Screen Time
 mom, a jarring experience, Kim said. 
As schools across the country and around the world shut down for weeks and months because of the coronavirus pandemic, parents are grappling with how theyll ever keep their kids occupied when were all supposed to keep to ourselves.
They are going to be fine with extra screen time over the next couple of weeks,""
Blowing up screen time limits may seem like the obvious choice for frazzled parents juggling their own remote work responsibilities. And thats OK right now. A pandemic is no time for parents to set sail on some screen-time guilt trip.
They are going to be fine with extra screen time over the next couple of weeks, said Sierra Filucci, editorial director of Common Sense Media. As long as youre choosing age-appropriate content, youre not going to do any major damage to your kids. 
Heres how parents can help their kids of all ages manage their technology use.
For preschool and elementary school kids with no homework
Dora the Explorer and Daniel Tiger might seem like the perfect babysitters for toddlers, preschoolers and young grade schoolers, who may be running wild underfoot. Turn them on.
If youre hunting for new sources to engage your kids, Common Sense Media has lists of top educational apps
 and TV shows, video games and books
 for kids ages 2 to teen. Khan Academy
 and Originator
 also offer educational apps for young kids.
If you need half an hour to have a conference call or take a shower, choose some high-quality media and sit them down in front of it, Filucci said. Theres lots of great stuff out there, and theres good research that shows that little kids can learn from really high-quality educational media.
Georgene Troseth, associate professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University, who has conducted some of that research, said parents often worry their kids will miss out on some other important activity when they fall back on technology. 
But, if what its replacing is the mom going berserk or its replacing the screaming or its replacing the fighting, Troseth said, it sounds pretty good.
Troseth recommends that parents use a variety of media to keep their youngest entertained. Turn on the TV, video chat with grandma and flip through picture books. Parents can be hands off, she said, but they should also check in.
For teens, let them know theyre not required to respond to every text.
Children can learn from media by themselves and do, Troseth said. But in many cases, they learn a lot more if parents are at least poking their head in the learning and supporting them when it seems to be helpful and backing off when its not needed. 
And when kids start displaying some bad behavior after watching a few episodes of Caillou, it might be time to move to something else. Parents know their children best, she said. 
Outside time (based on health officials latest recommendations), block and pretend play, reading, puzzles, coloring, indoor obstacle courses and other no-tech games and experiences
 remain important too. Keep it simple. This is nothing genius, Filucci said.
Older kids with schoolwork
For older kids, the days might begin on the laptop completing virtual lessons and then continue with more time on social media or gaming. Add up the hours, and its a lot of time staring into a screen. It just didnt seem right, Kim said of her own experience.
It was her oldest child, a seventh grader, who finally told her to chill out. He said, There are two different kinds of screen time theres screen time were doing for school and screen time were doing because we need to relax, she remembers. Experts say both experiences are important right now.
For kids with virtual school, it may be a struggle to keep them motivated, said Jeff Greene, a professor of educational psychology at UNC-Chapel Hill. 
To keep kids on track, build a daily routine that includes starting school, offering breaks and adding in recess at the usual times, Greene said. Create a dedicated space for learning, away from high-traffic areas, to prevent distractions. Apps that shut down social media or specific websites or help kids stay focused
 also can help. But what really is key are the discussions youre having with your child.
Ultimately, a conversation with the student is really important, said Greene, who studies online learning. We know that motivation and interest and volition are all more likely when students feel like they have choice, when they feel competent, when they feel cared for and understand the value of what theyre doing.
Away from schoolwork, parents should understand that socialization is critical for tweens and teens. So, parents should think hard before cutting off ways they can virtually check in with their friends just because theyre spending hours on their laptop for school.
But parents should still regularly talk with their kids to ensure those online connections remain healthy, said Ana Homayoun, author of  
Social Media Wellness
.
 Consider limiting group chats for kids in fourth through sixth grade, she said, because they can become overwhelming. For teens, let them know theyre not required to respond to every text. Help them understand they can opt out, she said.
For her part, Kim, whose second, fourth and seventh grader will be out of school until at least April 20, has dropped her screen-time worries and is taking the long view. The family, who is currently in Hawaii, goes on hikes and bike rides, but theyve also watched the directors cut of the Lord of the Rings series together. 
I dont want the narrative of my time during this coronavirus homeschool thing to be about remember when my mom was on me every single day about how much screen time I was getting, and she was driving me up the wall when the world was so stressful to begin with, she said. I want to change that to remember that time when we were forced to be all together and how we had so much fun and created some interesting memories."

On Sunday, John Oliver joined them.
""Both the place we normally tape on Sundays and our office building both had confirmed cases of coronavirus this week,"" Oliver says at the start his monologue. ""So our staff has been working from home, and we're currently taping this somewhere else, with a very limited crew.""
The focus of the last Last Week Tonight episode for a while? COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Oliver already did a segment on the virus a couple of weeks back, but this time his focus is on the escalation, the reaction, and crucially what we can do about it.
The host starts by criticising Donald Trump's question-avoiding tactics at a recent press conference (""That is a level of dodging responsibility that Trump has been perfecting ever since he was very much not in Vietnam."") before sharing some advice with viewers.
""Look, I know things are currently very scary,"" Oliver says. ""And things are going to be weird for a while. For weeks, and honestly, more likely months. And the fact that that is true makes it even more important that going forward, we're going to need to look out for one another. And not just in terms of containing the transmission of this virus, but also in terms of the economic impact this is going to have on people who may well not be able to weather it.""
Oliver's advice? Calling elderly relatives and neighbours, donating to food banks if you can afford to, and tuning out misinformation (""from sources like, sadly, the president"").
""Take care of yourself,"" Oliver concludes. ""Take care of each other. And we will be back, in some form, some time in the future. And until then, stay safe and good night."""

The president has defended calling  COVID-19 the sickness that develops from the virus the ""Chinese virus,"" despite lots of other folks calling that moniker racist. 
From a cursory glance, the handwriting on the president's notes on Thursday looks like Trump's handwriting. And we have plenty of evidence that he likes to mark his papers up with sharpies.
As the United States has struggled in its response to the coronavirus an utter lack of testing, faulty communication from leadership, a shortage of life-saving ventilators the White House has created a different controversy by calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" (or someother similar name).
World health officials have spoken out against that practice, saying it could lead to racial profiling (or worse) against Asians. In fact, there have already been hate crimes against Asians related to the coronavirus.

There are tools and tips for easing coronavirus-related anxiety Mashable has a list here that I've found useful.

Eighty percent of tweets come from 10 percent of its users as one of those extremely active tweeters, I can tell you that cutting down isn't so simple (especially since my job involves being online). 
And since the coronavirus has just barely begun to affect Americans' lives, there's a weird disconnect for truly online folks who know what's likely to come. Some people are hardly registering the virus as a problem, while online folks are already makingmemes about it.

Chris Gosling a 28-year-old, NYC-based, graphic designer and frequent tweeter described going out to a bar and avoiding a handshake, only for that person to laugh at the idea of getting the coronavirus. Gosling who, full disclosure, I know from childhood described a real disconnect between workers who sit at a computer all day looking at this stuff versus those who don't. 
""It will be interesting to see if the constant barrage of corona tweets is protecting us or just making us paranoid goofballs,"" he wrote over DM.

On Tuesday, the crowdfunding platform and review website announced a new partnership to help local businesses around the U.S. raise money while they're closed or offering limited services due to COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus.
Through the partnership, you'll soon be able to donate to restaurants, fitness clubs, nightlife spots, and beauty parlors through a button on their Yelp pages. This feature will roll out across the country over the next two days, first reaching the areas COVID-19 has hit the hardest. To qualify, businesses must have fewer than five locations and a GoFundMe. 
Businesses across America are closing amid the pandemic. Unemployment claims have jumped precipitously, according to data collected by Buzzfeed. Some businesses have already turned to GoFundMe for help, with one in three fundraisers created in the U.S. over a 48-hour period last week citing the coronavirus, according to CBS News.
In addition to the button, GoFundMe, Yelp, and the accounting company Intuit QuickBooks have pledged to match up to $1.5 million in donations. Eligible small businesses will receive up to $500 each through a grant, in addition to individual donations it receives. Money will be given to businesses that have either created a fundraiser through the Small Business Relief Initiative (a program supported by GoFundMe and Yelp) or have an existing GoFundMe where they've raised at least $500.
You can search for small business spots in your area using GoFundMe's small business locator.

When you start playing, a question about coronavirus (Can coronavirus stay on your skin?) will appear at the bottom of the screen, and you tap ""true"" or ""false."" The filter will then change, showing whether you got it right or wrong. 
You then have the option to tap the camera button on that screen, which lets you to send a snap of yourself within the frame of the game to a friend. That friend can then play the game, too, and you can send questions and answers back and forth to each other. Public health, but make it cute.
The game will roll out in the lens carousel to snapchat users late Wednesday/early Thursday; the icon is a yellow circle with a blue coronavirus illustration. 
However, you can try out the game right now by scanning the Snapchat code below with the app's camera. Then, the game should pop right up. From there, you can play, test your knowledge, and challenge your friends. 
Tech companies are battling coronavirus misinformation through fact portals, down-ranking and removing harmful information and products, introducing fact-checking programs, and more. Snapchat also launched a new way to learn about coronavirus through a designated space in its Discover platform on Wednesday. The trivia game is an altogether different, and readily accessible, approach.
Without in-person school or activities, maybe the Snapchat youth will be just bored enough to play a game that trojan horses public health information into their brains. Will it be enough to get them to take social distancing seriously? Here's hoping."

Whole Worker, an organization representing Whole Foods employees with hopes to unionize, announced over the weekend that workers at the Amazon-owned grocery chain are encouraged to participate in a nationwide ""sick-out"" starting Tuesday, March 31. The group's list of demands includes hazard pay at double the base rate for scheduled hours, guaranteed sick leave for anyone who self-quarantines, the shutdown of any Whole Foods store where an employee tests positive for the novel coronavirus, and more.
One thing to note is that Whole Worker assured anyone thinking of staying home that they can do so ""without fear of reprisal"" since Whole Foods has lightened up on its attendance policy.
The planned strike comes after weeks of criticism from employees and customers directed at Whole Foods for not doing enough to protect its workers. Amazon's organic grocery store chain has instituted some policies like a temporary $2 per hour pay raise and two weeks of paid time off for anyone diagnosed with Covid-19 (which is less broad than the Whole Worker demand). But the proposed sick-out shows that not everyone feels Whole Foods is taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of its workers. 
In a statement to Mashable, a Whole Foods spokesperson commended workers for their ""extraordinary dedication"" and noted all of the new policies listed above without directly addressing the strike or Whole Worker's demands. Mashable also reached out to Whole Worker for comment and we will update when we hear back.

Amazon has faced plenty of criticism during this pandemic, with workers planning to walk out of a Staten Island shipping facility on Monday. At least one worker at the facility tested positive for the disease, but it didn't close for sanitizing. Neither did a Whole Foods store in California after one of its employees tested positive. 
It's not the best look for a company run by Jeff Bezos whose net worth approaches $120 billion to potentially endanger or underpay workers deemed essential during a pandemic. We will keep you updated if these strikes go on as planned and result in any company policy changes."

Big reversals aren't the norm. 
Then Covid-19 hit.
As the looming threat of the coronavirus began hitting the U.S. in February, many tech companies started to roll out new ad policies.  
Google banned
 most nongovernmental Covid-19 advertising in early February. YouTube followed
 suit shortly after, demonetizing videos about the coronavirus so its advertisers wouldnt see their ads placed on unpleasant coronavirus content. 
Both companies, owned by Alphabet, classified the coronavirus as a sensitive topic, which is typically reserved for things like school shootings or natural disasters short-term events that bad actors could capitalize on to earn money from Googles advertising partners.
Its clear now that coronavirus is no short-term event. It has completely altered daily life for nearly everyone around the globe. 
SEE ALSO: YouTube is working on a TikTok competitor called 'Shorts'
How can you ban users from monetizing content when jobs have suddenly become so scarce? How can you ban advertisers some organizations trying to share important information about the virus from reaching as many people as possible?
They couldnt. Google and YouTube have both since reversed course on their coronavirus policies.
""As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we've been adjusting our enforcement to ensure that we are protecting users while prioritizing critical information,"" said a Google spokesperson in a statement
 to Protocol, which first reported on the Democratic Partys objections
 to Googles coronavirus ad ban.
Google added that it realized that COVID-19 is becoming an important part of everyday conversation and was working on opening its ad networks back up to coronavirus-related advertisements. 
YouTube began allowing
 certain channels on its platform to monetize coronavirus content in mid-March. It has since rolled that ability out
 to all of its monetization partners, as long as they follow the companys guidelines on misinformation, pranks, and distressing content.
Twitter also announced
 new ad policies tailored to Covid-19 in March. The social microblogging platform had a broad ban on promoted tweets about the coronavirus. This was before the pandemic caused people across the U.S. to self-quarantine in order to combat the coronavirus. 
This week, Twitter reversed
 course and allowed accounts to promote tweets mentioning the pandemic.
Many of these bans were rolled out with combating misinformation
 in mind. Facebook, for example, announced
 in February that it was banning coronavirus-related ads that promoted false cures and other Covid-19 disinformation. 
The following month, the social networking giant banned
 medical mask ads on Facebook and Instagram in an attempt to stop price gougers. The company has been unsuccessful
 in stopping this.
Even as the coronavirus hit U.S. soil, Big Tech underestimated the scope of what was about to happen. They rolled out policies that seemed to be the result of good intentions, and went on like the world would carry on as usual. They were wrong

Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story to share.
 (CNN)You've been daydreaming lately, if you're anything like me, imagining a glorious celebration with all the people you know and love. Now picture this one: a party in the summertime, a hall packed with brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and cousins and enough barbecue ribs for everyone. Face-painting and balloon animals for the kids. Whiskey and beer for the grownups. Careful, though. Keep it together. Uncle Dave is watching, so you'd best not misbehave.
Uncle Dave Parnell is a former Marine and legendary firefighter here in Detroit. He calls this the August Party, in honor of his family's many August birthdays. If you are fortunate enough to be at the August Party, you are either a Parnell or an honorary Parnell, someone worthy of the family name. There is a DJ, and a dance floor, and perhaps the ladies are moving fast to ""Watch My Feet,"" or slowing it down with the Dramatics. Maybe Dave's nephew Jonathan Parnell is cracking open another Modelo, letting the music wash over him, telling another story. Jonathan turns 50 this month, in August 2019, and no one knows this will be his last August Party.
Jonathan was 11 when his mother died of a heart attack. His grandmother took him in. Thelma Parnell, woman of steel, had 13 children, ten of whom survived. When young Jonathan told her, a little too confidently, ""I'm the man of the house,"" she said, ""Pass me my stick."" A lightweight pine baton for the persuasion of anyone who stumbled off the straight and narrow. And if that were not enough to guide young Jonathan, there were five uncles willing to enforce Thelma's law. ""Bring me some good grades, Jonathan, or I'm calling Uncle Dave.""
He stumbled a few times, as a boy and as a man, but he made it through high school, married a woman named Renee, had three sons and became a Detroit police officer. He loved his city, and he made it his mission to keep people safe. Another officer told me he noticed something else about Jonathan: he was always talking about his Uncle Dave, always hoping to make Uncle Dave proud.
And so, when an officer called him at 2 a.m. with some information on an auto theft case, he jumped out of bed and chased down the lead. When he took college classes or studied for promotional exams, he rounded up other cops and made them do it too, as if they would all rise or fall together. Sometimes he took his teenage son, Jonathan II, in the patrol car. Taught him how to spot a stolen vehicle, how to follow someone without being seen.
Jonathan rose through the ranks, from sergeant to lieutenant to captain, but he seemed to stay the same. He wasn't above taking a statement at a homicide scene, even though captains usually stay at the station. Always checking on his officers, making sure they were okay. Not just anyone can be a cop in the swirling cauldron of Detroit, let alone stay a cop. But Jonathan Parnell stayed for almost 30 years. He told a colleague, ""I'll be the last one out.""
Around the middle of March, Jonathan started feeling sick. Who knows where the virus found him. It's still raging through Detroit. He told one of his best friends, Lt. Mark Young, that he felt tired and was going home. That was a Wednesday or Thursday. On Friday he said he was going to bed, which was strange, because it was only 5 p.m. On Saturday he was getting tested for coronavirus. On Sunday he was going to the hospital, where apparently, he was not sick enough to be admitted. Back home with his wife on Monday, he told Mark ""this is a beast."" Jonathan was a vigorous 50-year-old man with no known health problems, and he could not seem to shake off the virus. The lieutenant texted him on Tuesday, March 24, and never heard back.
At least two other officers spoke to him that day. He said he was feeling better. Hours before he died of Covid-19, Captain Jonathan Parnell was talking about going back to work.
""He was dedicated to this job to the last breath he took,"" his friend and colleague Sgt. Dana Russell told me, struggling to keep her composure in a phone interview about two weeks later. By then, nearly 200 Detroit police officers had tested positive for coronavirus, including the chief, and nearly 400 were quarantined. Crime was going up. The police couldn't give their captain the bagpipes and full ceremony he deserved, so the sergeant told me she'd honor his memory the only way she knew how: By working even harder for the city they loved.
That name, Parnell. It meant something on those streets. Jonathan II was a boy in his father's cruiser, looking for suspicious vehicles. Now he's 25, an officer for the police force at Wayne State University in Detroit. He will go back to work soon, wearing that badge, carrying the heavy weight of his father's name.
One more thing you may want to know: Did Jonathan Parnell make his Uncle Dave proud?
""I think he went so far above that,"" Uncle Dave told me on the phone. Close your eyes with him now and picture Jonathan, and another August Party, not in the past but right this minute: the warmth of a summer evening, a cold drink in your hand. A room full of people who are glad to see you. A deep embrace that will never end."

Nothing is left untouched, including the organizing efforts of many activists and advocacy organizations. For activists reliant on public demonstrations, face-to-face meetings with representatives, and in-person group trainings, the coronavirus pandemic arrives at a particularly inopportune time: 2020, the almost instantaneously chaotic start to a new decade, is also an election year, meaning that activists are required to move their efforts off the streets just as in-person advocacy efforts would have been ramping up. 
On top of that, for many organizations that Mashable spoke with, the societal impacts of COVID-19 are escalating the urgency of many groups' goals: Moms Demand Action
, a grassroots organization within Everytown For Gun Safety
, is now expanding calls for secure gun storage with more kids at home because of coronavirus-spurred school closures. Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that also advocates for reproductive health care access, has seen states attempt to place bans on abortion, claiming it doesn't qualify as an ""essential"" health care service amid a pandemic.
For Sunrise, a youth-led climate movement, recommendations against large gatherings hinders planned, in-person events for the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, in April. Meanwhile, the League of Women Voters (LWV), a group that works to empower voters and encourage informed, active civic participation, has had to quickly adjust its outreach strategies, such as get out the vote efforts, during the election cycle. 
Even as advocacy groups re-organize around different deadlines and priorities, plenty of their tactics look similar: Many activist organizations have already shifted to digital communication even before the pandemic, whether they're older organizations adapting to an increasingly online world or youth-led movements composed largely of digital natives. The coronavirus, however, rapidly kicks these efforts into high gear with some organizations figuring it out as they go along. 
Heres whats working for them right now, and what it might mean for activism down the road.
Using social media to strike 
A clear, sunny day in a public place; people gathered together in common activity: It sounds like a common fantasy right now and the crucial ingredients for a public demonstration or strike, quickly rendered unfeasible as states place stay-at-home orders and the federal government advises against gatherings of more than 10 people. 
Of course, not all organizations engage in public demonstrations regularly. Some of those that do, however, have become well-known for their tactics, particularly those focused on pressuring leaders to rapidly change the course of decades of inaction on climate change, like Sunrise, which gained visibility after staging a sit-in at Nancy Pelosis Capitol Hill office. 
Indeed, as Earth Day, April 22, approaches, Sunrise and other environmental organizations have had to cancel upcoming in-person demonstrations while finding ways to still get their message out. 
To replicate mass gatherings amid COVID-19, activists are instead turning to digital strikes, in which supporters raise awareness online. One of the first signals of this shift came when climate activist Greta Thunberg encouraged those participating in the school strikes that she popularized to stay home, and conduct digital strikes. FridaysForFuture, Thunbergs movement, then outlined some suggested hashtags and photos to post during digital strikes. 
Now, youth climate organizations, including Zero Hour, US Youth Climate Strike, and Sunrise, have announced Earth Day Live, a 72 hour livestream to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. According to a representative from Future Coalition, the national network uniting the organizations for the event, the canceled in-person strikes have now fully pivoted to the livestream, which will include calls to action throughout, as well as ""a primetime block of performances and conversations"" on Earth Day itself. The entire livestream can be considered a digital strike, according to the representative; those tuning in will receive requests to participate through actions like sharing on social media using #EarthDayLive. 
At present, its unclear if digital strikes will bring about the same degree of attention that in-person strikes have granted in the past, at least on their own. 
Dana Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland whose research focuses on activism, told Mashable that striking exclusively through the use of a common hashtag can amount to ""yelling in an echo chamber,"" simply because a group striking is likely only really reaching those already familiar with their message in some way.
To break through a potential echo chamber, Fisher notes that groups striking on social media need to actively try to get new people to see information about their strike, just as passerby might see protestors in a city's center. Doing so effectively could involve asking those with large social media followings (and who are supportive of a group's cause) to retweet or share information about the strike, so that new people get exposure to it. Additionally, Fisher points out that viral videos, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's video about the Green New Deal, can also reach new, wider audiences, which is something that activists might want to replicate in order to reach potential supporters. 
Without actively courting new supporters, digital strikes aren't likely to have the same reach as in-person protest, Fisher explains. She points out, though, that groups are often coupling digital strikes with other actions online. 
Many climate groups, for instance, are also pairing their Earth Day activities with other actions, as Stevie OHanlon, a spokesperson for Sunrise, notes. In addition to participating in Earth Day Live, Sunrise will also be launching social media campaigns to aimed at members of Congress and elected officials. On top of that, O'Hanlon points to the organization's efforts to encourage supporters to email or tweet at their member of Congress about the principles behind a People's Bailout, a bailout that prioritizes individuals over corporations. FridaysForFuture also includes ""emailing politicians"" on its recommendations for climate activism amid COVID-19. 
""The goal is to create a groundswell of support,"" OHanlon said. ""[Our movement has] always been built on marshaling public support and we can still do that."" 
Fisher points out that this kind of synchronized action will reach further than digital strikes alone. 
""Young people had already starting using more of a hybrid,"" Fisher said, in reference to climate activists coupling in-person protests with digital tactics. ""If anyone is going to figure it out within these [current] constraints, it's going to be the young people."" 
Lobbying politicians...over Zoom 
The last few weeks have turned the sometimes disjointed sensation of talking to coworkers, classmates, friends, and family via video calls into a daily occurrence. For some organizations, a new comfort with video conferencing also extends to their interactions with an unlikely cohort: lawmakers. 
That was the case for Moms Demand Action on its planned advocacy day on March 16 in which volunteers and gun violence survivors were going to urge California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature to expand funding for the California Violence Intervention Program, according to Shannon Watts, the organization's founder. 
Initially, 800 supporters volunteered to participate, notes Watts, but as the event approached, her team realized that it was no longer feasible or appropriate to hold the event as planned, which would have involved going to the California State Capitol. 
So, Moms Demand Action did what everyone has been doing in the last few weeks: It pivoted to video call. Those involved set up Zoom conference calls that included the lawmakers who they would usually talk to on their previous advocacy days, as well as organizers from Moms Demand Action and gun violence survivors. 
Organizers met with Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (middle, second from left) on Zoom.
Image: everytown for gun safety
As with climate activists moving their strikes online, Watts felt as if one of the prime benefit of moving to virtual talks was the ability to keep the conversation going afterwards. Volunteers established hashtags for the day, such as #CALeg (California State Legislature) and #CAVIP (California Violence Intervention and Prevention), and then asked lawmakers to tweet using the same hashtags when sharing information about the call, according to Watts. With prominent retweets, like one from Watts' call with Jennifer Siebel Newsom, first partner of California Governor Gavin Newsom, Watts felt as if her team's advocacy efforts had an even wider reach than before. 
""We started in the morning, and tweeted all day long,"" Watts said. ""That's not typical.""

Please read below for important info on keeping our kids safe from guns during these times of home isolation and social distancing. https://t.co/JCSDnpELP2
 Jennifer Siebel Newsom (@JenSiebelNewsom) March 16, 2020
The League of Women Voters also turned to similar tactics, according to Celina Stewart, LWV's senior director of advocacy and litigation. LWV pivoted so its usual ""lobby core"" of members, who go to Capitol Hill every month, instead conducted their meetings with lawmakers via Skype. Like Watts, Stewart felt that these efforts were effective in that their meetings went on undeterred, so members could still communicate their message with lawmakers.
""We havent seen a downtick in meetings,"" Stewart said. 
Moms Demand Action and the LWV already had established relationships with those they spoke with, though. That shouldn't necessarily deter new groups from reaching out to lawmakers, Fisher said. Less established groups might still be able to arrange meetings. 
""I think trying to reach out for opportunities [to talk to elected officials] is always a good way to go,"" Fisher said. ""[In light of COVID-19,] elected officials are going to do everything they can to stay in touch."" 
In fact, Stewart thinks the move to remote meetings could actually prove advantageous for newer groups. 
""You might actually be able to get a virtual meeting that you couldnt get formally,"" Stewart said. ""You might only get 10 minutes the first time, but then you can establish that relationship so that next time they might give 15, then 20. Its a huge opportunity, especially because everyone has to work around this.""  
Deleting IRL outreach (for now)
Just like you, staring blankly into yet another screen, the managing teams at advocacy organizations have also had to move their entire existences online for the time being. For most, this meant scrambling to get their team equipped for remote work on short notice, as it did for so many other organizations around the country. 
But on top of that, many of these advocacy organizations also rely on a wide network of supporters and members outside their formal operating teams. This means that communication, training sessions, and forms of outreach like voter registration efforts have also become digital on short notice. 
Communicating with members and volunteers efficiently looks slightly different for each group, depending on their make-up and overall structure. Across the board, organizations are finding ways to connect with existing supporters while also trying to encourage new people to get involved. Still, Fisher points out that it's a particularly difficult time to grow a movement's base right now, due to the lack of in-person contact allowed. For now, groups are adapting to this as best they can. 
Planned Parenthood, for instance, is using the app Outvote to engage in what a Planned Parenthood representative calls relational organizing, in which supporters can reach out to people theyre in touch with, like neighbors and friends, to ask them to take action in some way on issues pertaining to reproductive rights. The actions that people might encourage would include things like calling your representative, asking friends to check their voter registration status, or advocating for them to share a post on social media, according to a Planned Parenthood representative. 
Other organizations that have grown through a particularly young base, like Sunrise, are looking at ways to engage a wider diversity of ages than they targeted before the pandemic. Sunrise launched a phone banking service for older Americans, dubbed the Peoples Dialer, in which organizers provide information, resources, and companionship in light of the coronavirus to older adults who might be at higher risk, while also highlighting why Sunrise believes the current crisis underscores the need for transformative policy agendas, a cornerstone of its advocacy message. 
To continue to engage with younger folks interested in learning more, Sunrise also launched Sunrise School to offer free informational and training courses to familiarize students with its platform. Those interested can sign up for individual courses on different organizing skills, which will then be held through Zoom conferences with multiple time slots, according to O'Hanlon. Similarly, a Planned Parenthood representative told Mashable over email that the organization's training team is ramping up a virtual training series to educate volunteers on how they can take action in this unique moment. 
Meanwhile, organizations with some older members, like the LWV, have had rockier starts rolling out remote communication tools. Some of its members were unfamiliar with platforms like Zoom, which are currently being used to replace in-person meetings in community center and libraries, according to a LWV representative. 
""They might have compromised immune systems but they want to continue working, so this is the way we do it,"" Stewart said. And despite their relative inexperience, she says members are learning fast out of necessity. ""Necessity changes the way you have to approach these things. If this ever comes up again, we've already done it. I think this could change the way we do work, period.""  
The LWV also had to quickly adapt a contact-heavy form of outreach voter registration to fit exclusively on their already launched digital platform, VOTE411. Now, Stewart notes, information that LWV members would typically convey in person, like finding your polling place or learning about issues on the ballot, gets communicated as alerts on the site. 
Of course, this has big trade-offs, Stewart notes, since the league's members might not reach the same amount of voters. Right now, though, they're doing what they can with what they have. 
Sunrise has had to adapt its voter registration plans as well. At present, O'Hanlon, the Sunrise representative, told Mashable that the organization will also be moving what it can online, and that the team will be making plans ""as the situation develops, and as it becomes more clear how long"" current social distancing mandates will continue. On Earth Day Live, which also involves other climate groups in addition to Sunrise, a spokesperson for Future Coalition, the network behind the event, told Mashable that there will be voter registration efforts, with a set goal for voter pledges and voter registration numbers. 
What now?
Like so much of the country, activists are grappling with an uncomfortable reality: This new normal might last for a while. 
Thus far, rapidly rolled out changes have largely meant either majorly ramping up previously existent resources, like digital strikes, or doing something totally new for the organization, like Moms Demand Action's virtual advocacy.
For the most part, the groups' leaders are taking things day by day, and week by week. But there's another question emerging, too: What's life going to look like after the pandemic? 
Some organizations are unsure for now, acknowledging instead that COVID-19 and the institutional problems that it has revealed make their messages all the more potent. 
""This is a moment where people of all walks of life are realizing, if they haven't already, that business as usual isn't serving the needs of working people,"" O'Hanlon said. ""We see this as a once-in-a-generation moment to rewrite the rules of our economy."" 
Others, like Watts, who built Moms Demand Action by connecting with other moms online, believe that this could be a watershed moment for activism as well. 
""When I started, I was just one of five sitting in my kitchen,"" Watts said. ""[We grew as we did] because so many other caring Americans connected with me on social media. We used these virtual tools to organize not just online, but also offline."" 
As the pandemic continues, she thinks even more digital innovations for activism will emerge and stick around after. 
""All these different ideas are going to come out of this,"" Watts said. ""There's no putting this genie back in the bottle."""

Marvel Studios' upcoming Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has called a halt to production amid concerns over the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, director Destin Daniel Cretton has followed his doctor's recommendation to self-isolate while shooting the film in Australia. Cretton decided to be tested for COVID-19 as a cautionary measure. Disney has suspended first unit production. Marvel has yet to release a statement, but Mashable has reached out for comment and we will update this story if we receive a response.
SEE ALSO: All the movie releases delayed because of coronavirus
The news outlet published a note given to the film's production crew, which points out that Cretton has a newborn child, a factor that reportedly helped his decision to be tested as a precaution. 
""As many of you know, Destin, our director, has a new born baby. He wanted to exercise additional caution given the current environment and decided to get tested for Covid-19 today. He is currently self-isolating under the recommendation of his doctor. While he waits for the results of the test, we are suspending 1st unit production in an abundance of caution until he gets the results this coming week,"" it reads. 
""This is an unprecedented time. We appreciate everyones understanding as we work through this.""
Shang-Chi, starring Simu Liu, was set for release on Feb. 12, 2021, but it remains to be seen how this delay will impact the release date. 
It's the second film to halt production in Australia this week, as THR points out, with Baz Luhrmanns Elvis Presley film halted in pre-production after star Tom Hanks tested positive for the virus.
The Marvel film joins a host of other ready-to-release films to have their release dates delayed due to the spread of the coronavirus, including Disney's live-action Mulan, John Krasinski's A Quiet Place II, the ninth Fast and the Furious film, and the 25th James Bond film, No Time to Die.

Since Wednesday night alone, In rapid succession, Trump banned travel to 26 European countries; the NBA suspended their season; and beloved actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they tested positive for coronavirus. 
For several weeks there have been cries for people to practice social distancing and working from home, if possible. But for many people such as those in food service, drivers, and delivery people that is not a luxury they have.
Many porn performers, of course, fall into that category. 
Conversations about the coronavirus in the adult industry began as they would in any other industry, according to spokesperson for Kink.com Michael Stabile. He compared it to guidance from the CDC: Work from home if you can, be extra diligent, etc. 
As the cases in the U.S. increased especially in industry hubs like Los Angeles and Las Vegas the conversations shifted to what could potentially happen if there was an industry-wide shutdown. The last time such a shutdown happened was in 2018 when a performer tested positive for HIV (in the industry, performers are tested every two weeks through the PASS program). 
Some studios have already begun adjusting their schedules. For example, Erika Lust Films
 is delaying shoots, and Erika herself is looking more performers and directors in less affected areas, according to the company's content manager. 
""The last thing you want is a situation where the risk is relatively high and people are worried about making rent""
Porn performer, director, and film maker Vex Ashley told Mashable that she's putting a temporary pause on shooting for her ongoing project Four Chambers until she knows more about how the situation is going to develop. ""I have films to edit and release to tide us over,"" she said in an emailed statement.  
Stabile estimated the biggest risk would be performers traveling for their shoots, but Kink.com is willing to work with performers if they are not comfortable. Stabile, who also works with the Free Speech Coalition, is working so communication is consistent across the industry. 
As of now, as with other industries, it is a lot of discussing what is the best course of action and how can people pay their bills should productions shut down. ""The last thing you want is a situation where the risk is relatively high and people are worried about making rent,"" said Stabile, ""and they go into situations where, you know, to shoot where they shouldn't, you know, or at a time when it might be more risky."" While Stabile said that those are the risks, these are also conversations the industry is used to having. 
Furthermore, Ashley believes that the world at large can learn from porn performers in this moment. ""When your body is your business you already value hygiene, cleanliness and precaution more than the average person and you're probably well versed with all the things you don't usually have to consider when you're not around other people's body fluids regularly,"" she said. Disclosure of illness is common in porn, and shoots are adapted or called off if need be. 
Sex workers like to freelancers, gig economy workers, and the like will be hit harder than those with salaries and health insurance. It is also important to note because some sex work is also illegal in many places, workers cannot seek the same benefits others can. 
""Sex workers, like all workers, are probably going to be hit by the climate of fear,"" said Ashley, ""but unlike a lot of workers they can't rely on sick pay or government subsidies to help tide them over because in some countries their work is still criminalised so they're one of the most vulnerable groups in a situation like this.""
""Sex workers, like all workers, are probably going to be hit by the climate of fear""
What's more, crew members of these productions are also in a difficult position. In 2020, performers can work from home with platforms such as OnlyFans and FanCentro at their disposal. The cam site Stripchat, Stabile said, has doubled payouts for Italian performers, and other companies may follow suit in order to help performers in the short term. 
But if productions stop, then crews don't work. This is of course true of mainstream productions as well, which Stabile argued may be more unsafe in this situation due to a larger amount of people, and those who do not know how to handle bodily fluids.
As with other elements of society, these are subject to change as we learn more about coronavirus, how many people are infected, and what the best course of action is. Stabile pointed out that the government will not bail out the adult entertainment industry. 
If coronavirus affects the industry longterm, there will be need for further discussion as to how to compensate people. Especially, because, let's face it: When we're all working from home more, there's likely to be an uptick in porn viewing."

YouTube deemed
 the coronavirus a sensitive topic in early March. It sometimes does that to protect brands from having their ads shown next to videos about disturbing events, like school shootings. 
However, YouTube made the decision before the pandemic fully hit the U.S. When it became clearer that this would be an all-encompassing story affecting everyones daily lives, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced
 in mid-March that it was going to allow some creators and news channels to monetize coronavirus content.
Now, YouTube is changing course again. This time its opening the topic to all YouTubers who have been approved for monetization in general.
Like all other monetized content, though, YouTubers who create coronavirus content will need to adhere to the companys Community and Ad friendly guidelines
.
According to YouTube it will show a limited number or even no advertisements on content that contains distressing footage, for example videos that contain people visibly suffering from COVID-19. 
The platform will also extend these ad policies to coronavirus-related pranks and challenges, such as  creators licking toilet seats, coughing or sneezing on bystanders, or trying to scare people into thinking they are sick with the coronavirus.
YouTube also specified that it will demonetize content containing medical misinformation. The platform defines this content as false/unsubstantiated claims about the cause, promotion of dangerous remedies or cures, origin or spread of COVID-19 that contradict scientific consensus.
Videos claiming that governments or corporations created the virus as a bioweapon or that it's spread via 5G technology fall under this category. It also includes content that says COVID-19 is targeting certain ethnic groups and videos that claim the pandemic is a hoax, cover-up or deliberate attack.
The platform has long struggled
 with potentially dangerous and harmful conspiracy theories and misinformation.
Along with its monetization guidelines, YouTube recommends some best practices when creating coronavirus-related content. The company urges creators to fact-check their work and be sensitive to the crisis affecting people around the world.
Its good that YouTube opened up these monetization policies so creators who create good and helpful work can be rewarded for their efforts. 
However, maybe it's time for YouTube to take another look at what sort of content monetized or not is even allowed on the platform to begin with."

Australia will make Facebook and Google pay for news content
A mandatory code for online news deals is on the way.
Australia has ordered its Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to create a mandatory code of conduct that would ask Facebook, Google and others to pay news outlets when they use content. The code would also dictate data sharing, news ranking and revenue sharing. There will be penalties if companies don’t follow through as well as a binding resolution process for any disputes.
Officials had been negotiating a voluntary code, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden hit to ad revenue for media companies prompted the shift to a mandatory system. The ACCC also said that it was “unlikely” tech companies would come to a voluntary agreement on payments. Government Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, meanwhile, argued that it was “only fair” that news outlets got paid for the work they were creating. It follows moves in Europe to tap tech companies that profit from media companies -- France has ordered internet firms to pay for showing news article snippets, and Google subsequently decided to remove news previews.

Instagram founders reunite to create a COVID-19 spread tracker
Rt.live shows how each state is controlling the virus spread.
Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have put out their first joint product since leaving Facebook, and it’s not a social network. It does, however, build on their work with virality. 
The two have launched Rt.live, a site that helps track attempts to fight the spread of COVID-19 in each state. The project takes advantage of Systrom’s open-source approach to calculating Rt (the average number of people infected by a given infected person) on a daily basis to show how well a given state is coping — anything below an Rt of one indicates a successful fight against the disease.
The site also helps make sense of the data in a way you don’t always see with these trackers. You can filter by region and the use of shelter in place orders (as you might guess, those states without orders are typically faring worse). Continue reading.

Too bad the misinformation campaigns aren't also all on hold.
1 with 1 posters participating
The presidential race has fallen off the top of every front page nationwide in favor of coronavirus coverage, but 2020 is still very much a high-stakes election year. Twitter, Facebook, and Google have all promised to beef up their efforts to let information spread freely while limiting falsehoods and disinformation, but it's a long uphill battleand with a little more than seven months to go until the election, it's one they do not seem to be winning.
The problem, a report today by The New York Times points out, is that not only are foreign disinformation campaigns in full swing, but the metaphorical calls are also coming from inside the house. Some platforms seem to be handling the challenge better than others. 
The Times spoke with several employees at both Facebook and Twitter about how they have to change their tactics endlessly, as their adversaries continually modify their own approaches.
""We're moving away from a model of waiting for a report to spotting patterns of behavior that can spot stuff before it catches fire,"" Carlos Monje Jr., Twitter's head of public policy, told the Times. ""We're constantly trying to stay one step ahead.""
Facebook, in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, began identifying and knocking down what it terms ""coordinated inauthentic behavior."" State-backed campaigns, such as Russia's well-documented (PDF) use of social media to influence 2016's outcome, fall into that category. In its most recent report, Facebook says in February alone it removed networks of accounts, pages, and groups originating in India, Egypt, Russia, Iran, Myanmar, and Vietnam.
Domestic actors, however, are proving as big a problem for platforms to solve. While Facebook permits false and misleading political ads, for example, it does have a bright line prohibiting interference with voter registration or the 2020 census, currently in process. The site did in fact follow through earlier in March, pulling several Trump campaign ads with misleading census informationafter the social media giant was called out by reporters, at least.
And yet even so, both Facebook and Google employees told the Times they fear to take any action that could lead to partisan blame. Some employees, ""said they feared being blamed by Democrats for a Trump re-election, while others said they did not want to be seen as acting in Democrats' favor,"" the Times explained. ""Privately, some said, the best-case scenario for them in November would be a landslide victory by either party, with a margin too large to be pinned on any one tech platform.""
As important as the entire US democratic process is in the long run, though, for the present moment the election feels as though it may as well be a hundred years away. Much more pressing is the challenge of misinformation related to the international COVID-19 crisis, which is very literally a life-or-death situation for billions around the world. 
Information related to the COVID-19 crisis is also distressingly politicized. Social media platforms back in early March (a few weeks, rather than a few decades, ago, no matter how long it feels) were caught flat-footed trying to keep up with the flow of incorrect information about the virus. In recent days, however, they seem to be catching up.
Google finally kicked conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars app off of Google Play late last week after determining it was spreading misleading, harmful information about the disease.
In the last few days, Twitter has been particularly active with attempts to quash coronavirus misinformationeven when it comes from high-profile users. Since Friday, Twitter removed Tweets from presidential adviser Rudy Giulani, conservative magazine The Federalist, and Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro for spreading false information about COVID-19.
Neither has Twitter let up. Earlier today, the site made Fox News host Laura Ingraham delete a tweet touting misleading information about a drug that has not been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19. Patients who take the drug, hydroxychloroquine, for auto-immune conditions are facing severe shortages after President Donald Trump began publicly praising its supposed efficacy."

8 with 6 posters participating
Apple will introduce four new iPhones this fall, according to a Bloomberg report, and at least some of them will sport a new design reminiscent of the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pro models or the iPhone 5.
Citing people familiar with Apple's plans, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman writes that in addition to successors to 2019's iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple will introduce not one but two successors to the iPhone 11. However, the report does not go into as much detail about the lower-end phones as it does the flagships.The 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max successors will have ""flat, stainless steel edges... as well as sharply rounded corners"" similar to what you may remember from the iPhone 5 back in 2012 and likely taking much more explicit cues from the iPad Pro design first introduced in 2018 and refreshed just a few weeks ago. They will also have flat screens rather than the curved edges found in today's iPhones and smaller notches on the front. Also, at least the larger of the two flagships will have a slightly larger screen than its predecessor.
The report claims that while the Pro iPhones will continue to offer three camera lenses and the successors to the lower-end iPhone 11 will have two, the high-end models will also include the lidar augmented reality (AR) sensor first introduced in the 2020 iPad Pro. Apple will also introduce a ""significant upgrade"" to the processor, aimed at improving the efficiency and speed of both AR and AI tasks.
Apple's engineers are expected to make a trip to China in May to finalize the design, but the phones might ship a few weeks later than usual as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. People familiar with Apple plans still expect the phones to ship in the same fall window as usual, thoughjust maybe a few weeks later in that window.The report does not touch on the rumored iPhone 8-based iPhone SE that is still expected this spring.
The report also touches on a few other rumored Apple products. The sources say that Apple is moving ahead with the oft-delayed effort to introduce a cheaper alternative to the HomePod as early as the second half of this year. It would be half the size of the original HomePod but with a similar design.
It has also been a poorly kept secret that Apple is working on a product called Apple Tags that would compete with Tile to help users track and locate lost personal items. The ""thin, small, puck-shaped"" Tags would be ""bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects,"" Gurman writes. Previous reports have indicated that Tags would be locatable via augmented reality, in addition to the usual functionality for these types of devices.
Finally, the sources say Apple is working on new versions of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV, plus updated budget iPadsbut no further details were given."

39 with 28 posters participating
President Donald Trump today said the United States will stop funding the World Health Organization until his administration completes a review of the group's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
""Today, I am instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Trump said at a press conference today.
The US gives the WHO $400 million to $500 million per year and ""has a duty to insist upon full accountability,"" Trump said. Trump said his administration will talk ""with other countries and global health partners"" about what to do with the US funding that would normally go to the WHO. The US provides about 15 percent of the WHO's budget. ""Administration officials signaled the [funding] suspension would be for 60 days,"" according to Bloomberg, which noted that the US has ""contributed $893 million to the WHO's operations during its current two-year funding cycle.""
Trump argued that ""the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death"" if the WHO had pushed back against China's claims. He said:
The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government's official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate immediately. Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening, despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary. The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time, tremendous amounts of time.
As The Washington Post wrote today, the WHO ""declared a global health emergency [by January 30], after which the president continued to downplay the outbreak and compare it to the flu."" The Trump administration finally recommended social distancing in mid-March.
Trump praised China in January, said virus was under control
Despite claiming the WHO should have known China was lying by mid-January, Trump himself praised China on January 24 for its ""transparency.""
""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" Trump tweeted at the time. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!""
The United States announced its first confirmed coronavirus case on January 21. On January 22, Trump said ""we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.""
But today, Trump said that the WHO in December and January should have ""done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency... this would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances at face value and... defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency.""
Trump talks up his travel ban
Trump further argued that his China travel ban announced on January 31 saved ""thousands and thousands"" of lives while the WHO was ""very much opposed to what we did.""
""The WHO pushed China's misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans,"" Trump said. ""They told us when we put on our travel ban, there was no need to do it, don't do it, they actually fought us.""
A USA Today article said ""there is no public record of WHO at any point actively criticizing the US or any other country for deciding to implement a coronavirus-related travel ban"" and that the WHO ""opposes all travel bans during a pandemic, not just Trump's."" Health experts say Trump's travel ban had little effect on the pandemic's spread.
Trump today said the pandemic would have been less severe if other countries had imposed travel bans like the US did. ""Fortunately, I was not convinced [by the WHO] and I suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives,"" Trump said. ""Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved... the WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above life-saving measures.""
According to The Washington Post, 38 countries imposed travel bans before Trump's took effect on February 2.
""It would have been so easy to be truthful,"" Trump said of the WHO, arguing that ""the WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many.""
As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the US, states have shut down schools and businesses to limit disease and death. Trump wants to get moving on reopening the economy, claiming yesterday that he has ""total"" authority to override governors and force states to rescind shutdown orders. But coalitions of governors on the East and West Coasts yesterday announced pacts to follow science, not politics, in their decisions on when to reopen economies.
Trump today said he will speak to all 50 governors and ""authorize"" each individual governor to ""implement a reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as is most appropriate."""

On Wednesday morning, Formula E became the latest real-world racing series to announce a move online to esports as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make public gatherings impossible. Starting this coming Saturday the electric racing series will start a nine-race esports competition using rFactor 2 as the platform. And since the series has always been a little more socially conscious than more traditional forms of fossil fuel-powered racing, it's partnering with UNICEF, collecting donations from viewers to pay for projects like buying protective equipment for healthcare workers and setting up home-schooling programs.
The first racescheduled for April 18is going to be the equivalent of a pre-season test, with no points on offer for the winners. But for the following eight weekends, the championship will be scored in the usual Formula E fashion, including points for fastest lap and qualifying in pole position, plus double points for the final race. In fact, each Saturday will see two races held in parallel.
One will be for the real-world Formula E drivers, with 14 of the grid confirmed for this coming weekend's race. The second is for professional esports racers and influencers, with entries going to the fastest 18 qualifiers of events held during the week leading up to each race. There's a pretty good prize for the aliens and influencersthe winner of that championship will get a test in an actual Formula E car, which puts them in good company alongside several colleagues from other publications who've been lucky enough to drive the electric race car for real rather than in a sim.
In addition to the parallel races, Formula E is doing something else a little bit different with the race format. Everyone gets a single qualifying lap to determine their grid position, and then the race will operate in a ""battle royale"" format, where at the end of each lap the last-placed driver is knocked out. Just 10 will remain for the final lap, which will be a dash to the finish, with points and glory on offer.
The races will be broadcast on Formula E's website, as well as its social media channels and YouTube, as well as on broadcast partners like Fox Sports (from April 25th). Happily for racing fans (and the real-world and sim racers, plus commentator Jack Nicholls who plan on doing double-duty) the series has coordinated with other esports competitions like The Race's All Star Esports battles to make sure there aren't any schedule clashes.
Although the graphics of rFactor 2 can't compare to other racing sims, it's a logical choice for Formula E. The series used the sim platform for its million-dollar esports race back in 2017, and the game has the current cars and liveries already modeled, as well as some of the series' real-world street circuits.As for resuming real-world racing, the serieswhich was one of the first to put races on hold as SARS-CoV-2 started to menace the worldstill has rounds scheduled for New York and London in July. Although right now, it seems highly unlikely we'll get lucky enough to see those happen."

What a turd of a year, eh? 2020 didnt start with a bang. It started with a plop. Its only April and already were all frantically fumbling for a lever, hoping to flush this deuce as quickly as possible, praying our toilet-paper stash holds out and the stench doesnt linger.
Maybe we should have seen it all coming. After all, the year began with Gwyneth Paltrows ridiculous lifestyle brand, Goop, releasing a six-episode Netflix series. Yep, Gwyneth Paltrow. The college-drop-out-turned-actor who couldnt identify a vagina on a diagram while claiming to empower women with a smorgasbord of pseudoscience. The same self-proclaimed wellness guru who endorsed squirting coffee up your keister, shoving a rock into your hooha, and letting bees sting you.
In her Netflix series, the madness continued. Among other things, she praised a wizard chiropractor who manipulates peoples energy fields by pretending to do Taiichi near themlike a weird guy in your neighborhood park who wears parachute pants and always smells like sandalwood. (At least its a social-distancing-compliant method, I guess.)
It was disturbing enough that Goop is a multi-million-dollar business. With the production of a Netflix series, it seemed like humanity had hit bottom. But, boy, was that wrong. Instead, it was just a skid mark on our collective underpantsa pungent prelude to what was sliding out next.
As our attention quickly shifted to COVID-19 and its heartbreaking havoc, so did my coverage here at Ars. Beginning in early January, I started reporting on the mysterious outbreak that linked to a live-animal market in Wuhan. Since then Ive been immersed in pandemic news, wading through the gush of data and events to try to provide thoughtful, measured, evidence-based reports to keep you as informed as possible.
Its an honor to do this work and I hope youve found it helpfuland maybe even a little comfortingin these extremely challenging, unsettling times. Its my biggest hope for my work, in fact.
But, whatever success Ive had at serving up useful coverage, its all thanks to Ars. I couldnt do what I do anywhere elseand I know, Ive worked at a lot of places.
At Ars, I have the freedom to cover topics in my beat when I want and how I want. I can dart from writing light-hearted pieces about the tech behind fart-tracking pills to exposing abuses in the pharmaceutical industry to delving into bizarre medical casesall on top of covering devastating pandemics with all the weight they demand.
And this extraordinary freedom comes with a truly amazing amount of trust and support. I cant say enough good things about our managing editor Eric Bangeman and our Senior Science Editor John Timmer.  They guide me, make sure Im doing OK after weeks of grim pandemic coverage, offer help when I need it, and are always thoughtful and compassionate.
That said, this isnt a walk in the park with weird Taiichi guy, either. They challenge me, too, as does the editorial board and the rest of the staff. Theyre all creative, incredibly sharp, fun, inquisitive, and ambitious. They ask questionslots of questionsand push me. They make me want to go extra miles.
In short, at Ars, I get to be the best version of me.
In normal timeswith this mix of awesomewe do pretty well at keeping Ars going. But in these stinky times, our future is threatened. We need your help. If you can, please consider subscribing to help maintain this wonderful community.

ACLU outlines privacy concerns for contact tracing tech
One of its main concerns is ‘mission creep.’
With contact tracing tech under development to fight the spread of COVID-19, watchdogs at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are urging the government and tech companies to take a tougher stance on privacy. Apple and Google’s proposal would use Bluetooth data to detect phone owners’ potential exposure to people who have tested positive for COVID-19. The companies say they will take a “privacy-preserving” approach to data collection.
“While some of these systems could offer public health benefits, they may also cause significant risks to privacy, civil rights and civil liberties,” the ACLU’s Surveillance and Cybersecurity Counsel Jennifer Stisa Granick wrote in a blog post. Continue reading.

Each year, there are usually one or two ""it"" carshotly anticipated new models that everyone's eager to drive. The Tesla Model 3 had that buzz. So did the Porsche Taycan. And this year, the Polestar 2 has it. Polestar used to be a badge for souped-up Volvos, but the Swedish company and its Chinese owner Geely spun the brand out as its own thing, a purveyor of electric performance cars that keep capturing our imagination. And its important new battery electric sedan has just started production at the company's factory in Luqiao, China.
The new brand's first model was the cerebral Polestar 1, a plug-in hybrid GT that will remain a rare sight on the roads. That car was more of a four-wheeled statement, a carbon-bodied coupe that said ""Hi, we're here, and look what we can do with access to Volvo's car architectures."" The follow-up is a much bigger deal. For one thing, it's fully electric, a format to which future Polestars will adhere. It also promises to be much more practicalthe Polestar 2 is a four-door fastback, designed to tempt buyers who are bored with the conventional German and Japanese sporty sedans.And it packs some interesting technology. The car shares the same Compact Modular Architecture as the Volvo XC40, which was designed from the ground up to have BEV variants. The Polestar 2 also uses the same 78kWh battery pack that will go into the electric version of that crossover, giving it a WLTP range at launch of 470km (292 miles). It's also one of the first cars to use Android as its infotainment OS, chosen in large part because of the robust developer ecosystem.
It's also notable that Polestar is able to put its new BEV into production at a time when car factories in the US and Europe are mostly closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The world is facing enormous upheaval in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. We start production now under these challenging circumstances with a strong focus on the health and safety of our people. This is a great achievement and the result of huge efforts from the staff in the factory and the team securing the supply chain. I have a huge amount of respect for the entire teamthanks to them!"" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.
A US-spec launch edition of the Polestar 2 will cost $63,000 before any EV incentives are accounted for, although less fully loaded versions should see sticker prices in the $40,000-$50,000 range. The company had planned to start deliveries in Europe this summer, then following later this year in China, Canada, and the US, although we wouldn't be surprised if China takes pole position thanks to COVID-19.

Untold millions in the United States and around the world are following the advice of public health workers and government officials and hunkering down at home. Being at home, however, doesn't stop consumers from consuming either necessities or the occasional frivolity. The easiest way for loads of folks to get all those thingsfrom paper towels, diapers, and cat food to replacement crayons, a new checkers set, or a copy of the latest Animal Crossing gameis to sit down at the computer, or open a mobile app, and hit up Amazon, where business is booming.
Business is doing so well for Amazon, in fact, that the company said yesterday it needs to hire another 100,000 US warehouse and delivery workers immediately to meet demand. 
The company is not being shy about potentially poaching part-time workers from other industries, such as restaurants and hospitality, whose jobs have been adversely affected by the near-total shutdown of several major US cities. ""We also know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants, and travel are lost or furloughed as part of this crisis,"" the company wrote. The company also said it's basically open to hiring everyone as temps just for the duration, adding, ""We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.""
In addition to creating new full-time and part-time positions to handle the crush, Amazon said it is increasing wages for warehouse workers across the board from a minimum of $15 to a floor of $17, with similar raises in other regions (""C$2 in Canada, £2 per hour in the UK, and approximately 2 per hour in many EU countries""). That increase, however, is currently only guaranteed through the end of April and may not necessarily become permanent.
Unsafe working conditions?
Workers already busting their butts in Amazon's many fulfillment centers, however, are complaining that the company's policies are putting them and their loved ones at risk of contracting novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.
Full-time employees at Amazon's corporate headquarters in Seattle have been working from home for a few weeks already, after one employee tested positive for the virus. (Amazon's corporate office, like that of many other tech firms, is now operating with the vast majority of full-time staff remote as Seattle and the Bay Area are both under shelter-in-place orders to attempt limiting the spread of the disease.)
Part- and full-time workers in the logistics arms of the business, however, obviously can't stay home. Instead, Amazon is offering two weeks of sick pay to workers either diagnosed with the disease or placed in quarantine and is allowing employees to take unpaid time off through the end of March without being fired for it.
Many employees, both in the United States and overseas, are arguing it's nowhere near enough.
""They're offering no preventative solutions, only payment for workers after we've been infected, which doesn't help to slow the spread of the pandemic or alleviate the suffering [and] risk of death from contracting it,"" a Chicago-area Amazon warehouse worker told BuzzFeed News last week.
""Many of us feel like Amazon is being reckless with our health,"" a New Jersey Amazon worker told BuzzFeed in an updated story this week. Several workers in Amazon fulfillment centers told BuzzFeed that hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes are in short supply in several facilities. The warehouses are not receiving extra cleaning, they added, and ""stand-up"" meetings that require several workers to cram into a small space together for 10 or 15 minutes at a time are still taking place every shift.
Working overtime
Workers at Amazon's UK facilities are working compulsory overtime to try to meet the demand, according to the BBC, and are concerned about the potential effect the extra hours will have on their health and susceptibility to illness.
And the illness is coming: Bloomberg News reported yesterday that at least five Amazon warehouse workers in Europe have tested positive for COVID-19. Two of those employees were at a warehouse in Italy, with the other three in Spain. Local union officials in both countries told media that Amazon rejected requests to close the facilities for deep cleaning.
""We are giving our support to the employees that are currently in quarantine,"" Amazon told Bloomberg News in an emailed statement. ""The security and safety of our employees is our main concern and we are following the directives of the local and international health authorities, and we have applied a series of preventative health measures in our centers across the world."""

Almost 20 years ago, faculty in the chemistry department of Stanford University launched a distributed computing project called Folding@Home (F@H). They sought to understand how proteins self-organize and why this process sometimes goes wrong, causing issues such as cancer and Alzheimers Disease.
F@H hit its pinnacle of mindshareand performancein 2007, when Sony added it to the PlayStation 3. But like many other projects, it saw a gradual decline in its popularity since. This past March, however, F@H saw a sudden resurgence. Thanks to a confluence of events, notably including the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Folding@Home broke the exaFLOP barrier at least one or two years before Intel, AMD, IBM, or Cray could do it. Heres how those events played out.
In distribution
Distributed computing projects partition a massive processing job out to individual computers, with each doing a small slice of the job. You can set the most distributed computing apps to run only when your PC is idle or let it run in the background while using it.
SETI@Home, which was one of the first high-profile projects, sifted through radio telescope recordings to look for extraterrestrial signals. GIMPS, or the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, sought to find the largest prime numbers ever. Distributed.net tried to break RSA encryption. And so on.
The higher-profile SETI@Home recently ended its 21-year run having found nothing. By contrast, Folding@Home yielded quite a few results, in the form of 233 research papers. Among the big finds were studies into the dynamic nature of kinases and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as well as work on antibiotic-resistant bacteria and proteins from the Ebola virus.
F@H learned new ways to target these proteins in structure-based drug design, and findings from the simulations are being used by labs and startups, according to Dr. Vijay Pande, the former Stanford chemistry professor who led the project for 19 years. Today, Pande is a venture capitalist with Andreesen Horowitz. One of the reasons I changed [careers] to investing is because we have shifted from the basic question of how we need to understand, to 'this is helpful,' to 'lets get this information into the hands of people who can use it,' he said.
But like many other distributed projects, F@H has had its ups and downs. Its appearance on the PlayStation 3 was definitely an ""up""all you had to do was download the software and leave the PS3 on when you werent gaming. The console, powered by the way-ahead-of-its-time Cell processor, helped Folding@Home break the petaflop barrier in 2007, long before any supercomputer did. Millions of PS3s and PCs collectively achieved performance the top supercomputers could not equal.
Revival
At its peak, the PS3 brought in 15 million users, but it didnt last. Sony ended F@H on PS3 in 2012. The numbers on other platforms fell more gradually, and by January 2020, F@H was down to 30,000 users. Thirty-thousand is still pretty good, said Dr. Greg Bowman, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a former student of Pandes who now heads the project. We had an interesting shift where people moved to laptops. The number of users was going down, but overall compute power was increasing because people participating had more powerful machines.
One thing every distributed computing project has in common is that they are very processor-intensive, so participating PCs run very hot; your PC will go from 3 percent utilization to 100 percent very quickly, and if you are using stock cooling, the machine might overheat. So projects like F@H are best suited for a high-performance fan- or water-cooled tower PC, not laptop, where cooling is often minimal. Thats why the Mac is such a minor presence on the client list: MacBooks and iMacs are not suited to run at 100 percent CPU and GPU utilization.
Then in February, everything changed. Folding@Home suddenly went from 30,000 volunteers running the software in February to 400,000 in Marchanother 300,000 users came on board after that. There were so many users that the database ran out of potential simulations for them to crunch, and data coming in was so great that the servers were overloaded, said Bowman.
Despite these glitches, F@H zoomed to a peak performance of 1.5 exaFLOPs, making it more than seven times faster than the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
What caused this? For starters, interest in finding a therapy for COVID-19 helped. SETI@Home announcing the end of its project on March 31 also meant tens of thousands of people were looking for something new to run on their PCs. But the big boost came March 13, when Nvidia tweeted out a call to arms.
Join us and our friends at @OfficialPCMR in supporting folding@home and donating unused GPU computing power to fight against COVID-19! the tweet read. It linked to a Reddit forum with further details and information. That helped a lot, said Bowman.
A little too much, as it turned out. We handled the first three- to five-fold increase in traffic without breaking a sweat, but when it hit twenty times, our servers were struggling to write all the info people were finding to disk, he said. 
With just six servers at Washington University and partner sites at Sloan Kettering and Temple University, so much data was coming back and being written to disk that F@H stopped sending out work units. New servers have since helped them catch up. It did put a pause on the F@H teams main project, a significant rewrite and update of the client app. Thats on hold for now, Bowman said.
Findings
What does protein folding have to do with COVID-19? The goal is to explore the folds of proteins on the coronaviruss surface, trying to find spaces for other molecules to fit in a way that can interfere with the virus's function.
The surface of the coronavirus could almost be viewed as a thing of beauty if it werent so deadly. It looks something like a Christmas tree ornament, with red appendages that look somewhat like an inverted traffic cone. These are called spike, a complex of three proteins. For the virus to attach and infect human cells, spike has to open. Bowman said the function reminded him and his group of the Demogorgon from the show Stranger Things.
Before spike opens, the interface it uses to interact with cells is buried internally; only after it opens can the interface be targeted by drugs. Bowman and his team programmed F@H to hunt for what he called cryptic pockets in this interface. The idea is that if you look at the snapshots of what a protein looks like, it may or may not have pockets amenable to design. Weve had previous success with antibiotic resistance and Ebola where a small molecule would bind tightly to shut off binding, he said.
The project is still in the first stage, where researchers look for insight into how the spike proteins function and can be targeted. The project is doing computational screenings of molecules and will prioritize those that bind tightly to the viruss proteins.
Bowman says he will share his findings with anyone who wants them. Were looking to put big data sets on the Internet to others to see how it works or pursue drug design, he said.
Can it be sustained?
Folding@Homes fall in users wasnt an isolated incident. Once a novelty complete with teams (including a F@H team for Ars), it was one of many distributed computing projects that have fallen off in recent years. Kirk Pearson, who has maintained a master list of distributed computing projects for more than a decade, said the projects have lost their novelty. 
When SETI@home began in 1999, it attracted a lot of volunteers with its colorful screensaver and the new, exciting idea that anyone with a computer could find the first radio signal from an extra-terrestrial civilization, he said. But discoveries can take several years and a lot of repetitive work to find, and if the average person doesn't discover something quickly, he loses interest and moves on to something else.
Hes not exaggerating. GIMPS started in 1996, and in 24 years, it has found 17 massive prime numbers. The last prime number found by GIMPS was on December 7, 2018it was 24,862,048 digits long. Before that, a 23.2 million digit prime was found in January 2018, and before that, a 22.3 million digit one was found in January 2016. That doesnt exactly feed the need for instant gratification. 
Pande has another idea about what changed. One thing that had a huge impact on distributed computing in general was the rise of cryptocurrency. It engaged a certain group of people and got their attention and had a similar impact on other programs like Folding@Home. But, he adds, I think people are realizing you can make a little money on cryptocurrency or have an impact on the world.
Bowman hopes he can maintain this interest in having an impact. I hope people will stick around once we get this virus under control and help us get control over diseases like cancer and Ebola, he said. Were looking to learn why this is so much more infectious. For the foreseeable future, I think we will be quite busy with this. Over time, [we'll] start putting it on other things.
Pearson believes Folding@Home will inevitably lose a large amount of its new volunteers once COVID-19 is no longer in the headlines and the project 's novelty fades. But hes optimistic many will stick around. 
Every novel new distributed computing project creates a new group of excited volunteers, and many of those new volunteers will become long-term volunteers like me who will help Folding@Home's other projects find cures for Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis; World Community Grid's other projects find cures for childhood cancers, AIDS and Tuberculosis; and many other projects make new biomedical and scientific discoveries, he said.
As Pande put it, We all play a part in infecting each other and can all play a part in hopefully curing each other."

As the Colorado River slowly dwindles, groundwater resources are depleted, and wells are being dug ever deeper, the specter of drought looms in the USparticularly, but not exclusively, in the arid Southwest.
Preparing for gradual changes like these is not sexy or popular. But there is a huge amount of crucial work to be done to mitigate the worst possible outcomes of increasing drought, writes environmental politics researcher Megan Mullin in a paper in Science this week. Fragmented water systems across the country have a litany of critical vulnerabilities that will ensure that the worst effects of water scarcity will hit the most vulnerable people in society the hardest.
Crumbling into dust
The Southwest has experienced an abnormally dry period that started back in 2000an emerging megadrought that is due partly to natural climate cycles and partly to anthropogenic climate change. Higher temperatures increase moisture demand from the land surface, writes climate risk researcher Toby Ault in a second Science paper on drought this week, for the same reason that a sauna will dry out a towel faster than a steam room. Climate driven changes in the patterns of snow and rainfall can also contribute to drought.
As a result of lower levels in rivers and reservoirs, people have been tapping deeper and deeper wells to access steadily depleting groundwater resources, which are often poor qualityor even unusableat greater depths.
On top of this, water infrastructure is frequently poor to begin withand often deteriorating. Drought emergencies are declared regularly in the US, Mullin writes, with water systems sometimes running so dry that its necessary to turn to tanker trucks or even fire hoses to bring water into the community for weeks or months.
This means that drought is more than a natural disaster in the making: like the coronavirus outbreak raging through the US, its a disaster thats natural in origin but magnified by poor infrastructure and societal fragmentation. There are more than 50,000 water services in the US, 82 percent of which deliver water to fewer than 3,000 people. These small systems face a range of problems, from a lack of funding to smaller staff that dont have the necessary expertise to manage drought mitigation.
Underfunded water systems are more likely to have drought-exaggerating problems like leaking pipes that waste precious water or emergency lines that have not been maintained. They may also run into financial difficulty if people reduce their water usage because this reduces their revenue streams, Mullin points out. And because society is already spatially segregated along racial and economic lines, the water services in poorer areas are likely to be hit the worst.
Some of the bigger, better-funded water systems are already working hard at preparing for more severe and long-term droughts. But smaller systems arent doing the urgent work of gathering data on their current water supply or ramping up their ability to deal with shortages in the future, Mullin writes.
Staving off disaster
One of the most important starting points for building some resilience is gathering data, Mullin argues. We need to know how water systems across the country are financed, what their supply and usage look like, and the state of their infrastructure. Dealing with funding problems and moving away from a system that relies on local funding to prop up water systems is another important step.
But this will be challenging, since elected politicians benefit more from disaster response than disaster preparation, she writes. And thats true of the overarching, slowly moving disaster underlying the drought risk, too. Cutting CO2 emissions reduces drought risk, writes Ault. Avoiding just half a degree of warming would make a meaningful difference to regional drought risk, he addsthe world would look very different with 2ºC of global average warming compared to 1.5ºC.
Disaster preparation demands allocation of time and resources to an issue that is not yet kicking down the door. But the world is experiencing first hand what it looks like when warnings of a looming disaster have not been heededand with megadrought swiftly encroaching on North America, drought preparation is crucial.

""Maintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.""
While Facebook has so far been able to keep its services up and running, the company has had to make some concessions. Facebook has decreased video quality in Europe, and has pulled back most of the contract workforce who work as content moderators.
The company also warned that its revenue could take a hit, as its ad business has declined in recent weeks due to the pandemic. Twitter and other media companies have issued similar warnings.

 (CNN)As Covid-19 spreads throughout the United States, the number of people who need medical attention could overwhelm our health care system. If that happens, estimates vary, but most agree that the need for hospital and intensive care unit beds will far outpace our supply. 
Indeed, Covid-19 will likely strain an already overwhelmed health care system in the US, with many hospitalsoperating near or at full capacity. This is even more concerning when one considers that Italy, where Covid-19 is currently wreaking havoc on the health care system, has significantly more hospital beds and doctors per capita than the US. While hospitals around the US are working to expand their capacities, we may still fall short, especially if the coronavirus continues to spread at current transmission rates. 
How do we care for everyone who will need it in the coming weeks and months? We must create a parallel Covid-19 care system.
Establishing a parallel health care system for the coronavirus that uses a secondary workforce would allow us to rapidly increase our capacity, mitigate the burden on our existing provider workforce and reduce patient-to-patient or patient-to-provider transmission that could endanger the vulnerable people already hospitalized for other reasons.
Led by the US Public Health Service with the support of the military, this parallel Covid-19 care system would consist of designated treatment centers set up for the express purpose of evaluating and providing supportive care to patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 infection. Ideally, these centers would exist in less densely populated areas easily accessible from major metropolitan areas.
Our militaryexperts in logistics in high-stress emergency scenarios has a long history of rapidly standing up facilities like these. The US Army, for instance, deploys Combat Support Hospitals, mobile hospitals housed in tents and expandable containers, to provide care in combat settings. Covid-19 treatment centers could borrow features from these existing models.
Our logistics-driven military branches are an ideal fit to staff this parallel system, given they can be trained and deployed rapidly. This secondary workforce could be overseen by medical professionals (military or civilian) and broadly capable of contact tracing, containment, mitigation and supportive medical treatment. Fortifying their efforts might require enlisting retired physicians and nurses, empowering resident physicians and training non-providers with something akin to what emergency medical technicians receive so they are able to administer basic care under the oversight of a licensed health care provider. 
This would fill existing gaps in our public health and health care infrastructure and offload some of the burden from local authorities and medical providers. Of course, providing adequate personal protective equipment and rigorous training and instruction is a prerequisite to any deployment.
A patient experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 might present to a local emergency room (or, preferably, call a national hotline number or engage virtually with a health care provider). After medical professionals either confirm a patient has Covid-19 or rule out alternative diagnoses, the patient would immediately be transported to a COVID-specific site by way of a free, safe and accessible transit designed to prevent transmission. There, trained workers would evaluate the patient and provide supportive medical care.
Importantly, the Covid-care system must be prepared to handle the sickest patients -- such as those in significant respiratory distress -- because they require the most resources and present the greatest challenge to the existing health care system. This will require both negative pressure rooms that prevent cross contamination, as well as ventilator supportwhich is currently limited in the face of a surge from the pandemic.
In this respect, Covid-19 will require us to draw upon the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile, but also to innovate new technology to provide ventilation support quickly, efficiently and at scale.
Besides alleviating the stress on our health care system, this parallel system would also better support public health functions, like tracking, data reporting and quarantining. Protocols would be centralized and executed uniformly, instead of disparately by private systems with their own standard operating procedures.
Creating a parallel health care system for Covid-19 and staffing it with a secondary workforce is no small task. It requires thoughtful planning, expert input to work out the details, near-perfect coordination across many groups at all levels of government and careful execution to implement at scale. Above all, it requires leadership. 
Now is the time for decisive action. With direction from the White House and Congressional appropriations, we can mobilize the resources necessary to create the Covid-care system we need to reduce the stress on our health care system and provide quality care for those who will suffer from this epidemic.
 Without aggressive measures like the ones we propose here, we fear the consequences of Covid-19 on the function of our health care system for all patients."

Several members emerged from an all-members House briefing Thursday morning saying they were told the government is working around the clock to make tests, but the US system is trying to catch up to other countries like South Korea.
Members were exasperated with what they said was a lack of clarity in the officials' answers, as lawmakers struggle to understand how the US has been so far outpaced by other countries grappling with the pandemic.
As he left Thursday's briefing, GOP Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said there is ""a growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers"" from the administration about testing capabilities.
He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""struggled to give a really strong answer"" on why the United States hasn't been able to duplicate testing that is being used in places such as South Korea.
""I don't think anyone is going to leave that briefing satisfied with what's going on with testing right now ... bottom line, you leave that briefing and we are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there,"" said Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois. ""We are flying blind.""
And Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney of New York said it was ""simply the worst briefing I've ever received in seven or eight years in Congress.""
""The administration has no good answers, no plan, there's no leadership,"" he added. ""I think members of both parties are frustrated and angry, and they have every right to be.""
The briefing comes at a pivotal moment for Congress in the pandemic. D.C. offices in the House of Representatives and the Senate are shuttering amid the report of an aide working for Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell tested positive for the virus. Congressional leaders on Thursday officially announced the Capitol will be closed to tourists for the rest of the month. Several lawmakers themselves are self-quarantining as their offices undergo deep cleaning. The House is expected to pass a bill Thursday to respond to the outbreak, but Republican leaders in the House and the Senate have expressed their opposition to the bill.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday at his weekly press conference that Democrats and Republicans should negotiate to reach a consensus, calling for members to stay in town to get it done instead of leaving for a week-long recess scheduled to start Thursday afternoon as planned. 
McCarthy said he doesn't want to rush the legislation, but expressed optimism that an agreement could come quickly if Democrats choose not to put the current version of their bill on the floor for a vote.
""It's more important we take a moment to step back. Let's work together,"" McCarthy said. ""I think we can get this done in 24 or 48 hours, yes. I think it's critical that we do.""
The main priority for both parties in their conversations with the Trump administration has been on boosting testing for the coronavirus.
During the House briefing, Rep. Raul Ruiz, a California Democrat and a physician, asked the officials why the United States hasn't developed or purchased drive-through testing technology, according to a member in the room. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the FDA, didn't have a good answer, the member in the room said, but Hahn said that American testing has more regulations and takes longer to set up.
At least one lawmaker has become a symbol himself for availability of coronavirus testing. A spokesperson tweeted Thursday morning that Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia has not been given the test after having a meal with a person who tested positive for the disease.
""We tried to get a test for him, not bc he is special, but bc of who he interacts with,"" tweeted Beyer's spokesperson Aaron Fritschner. ""Thought it important to know ASAP. But there aren't enough tests, he didn't meet the risk threshold. Member of Congress."" Beyer is one several lawmakers who is self quarantining. 
Some lawmakers are calling on canceling the week-long recess specifically to address the testing issue. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska cited nursing home operators in his home state, saying they don't have enough kits to investigate possible cases. 
""Instead of going into recess next week, the Senate ought to keep working on the people's business both addressing the obvious deficiencies in our diagnostic testing pipeline, and debating the President's call last night for economic legislation,"" Sasse said in a statement. ""The Senate has work to do, let's get to it.""
GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, an ally of Trump, told CNN that the President ""should stop saying"" that anyone can get a COVID-19 test if they want one.
""It's not consistent right now"" with what representatives of federal agencies told senators, Lankford said. ""That is not accurate right now. People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now. That's not here at this point.""
""I don't know that anyone is satisfied with where we are right now,"" Lankford said.

Wuxi, China (CNN)My Facebook feed bulged with post-lockdown food fantasies. Friends dreamed of a ""salted caramel milkshake"" or ""a cheeseburger topped with feta, fried egg, and avocado with sweet potato french fries."" But if there's anything I've learned after emerging from my own two-week quarantine in China, it's that we can't simply click our ruby slippers and return to life BC -- before Covid-19.
I'm from Woodbridge, Virginia, and I've lived in China for four years. I was traveling in Australia and New Zealand over the Chinese New Year when I heard that the coronavirus had raged through the city of Wuhan, about 500 miles west of where I live. I got repeated notices from the US Embassy that ""recommended,"" but did not mandate, that Americans leave China. As my return date neared, many colleagues decided not to go back until the virus madness subsided. ""Any place but China is safe,"" they said.
When I heard that everyone entering China must go through a mandatory, sealed quarantine I had a sense of doom. What if I needed to escape? How would I get food? Another expat who was in the middle of her own lockdown convinced me that it was manageable. ""You're in your own home with all amenities and they bring you food and other supplies as needed,"" she said.
I felt I needed to get back to my students. As we would not be allowed to enter our campus until we completed the two-week quarantine, I felt the sooner I did it the sooner I'd be able to get back to my regular routine. A human rights activist by vocation, I realized I was more fortunate than those who faced uncertain fates, such as refugees and undocumented workers. 
I entered my 14-day quarantine welcoming it as a spiritual and psychological challenge. I chronicled my in-home journey on the Afro website, describing my life in quarantine.
On February 22, I completed my time in isolation and broke the barrier that had concealed me in my apartment unit for two weeks. Interestingly, I had not been as confined as I thought. I'd been under the impression that my door was bound by a heavy-duty, airtight tape. In reality, it was only obstructed by a simple piece of paper. The neighborhood committee -- somewhat like a homeowners' association -- that monitored my quarantine had glued this paper from the door's left panel to the frame. If I had broken quarantine, the paper would have ripped, indicating my escape.
I have now been out of quarantine for almost 40 days -- and life is far from normal. Even though the virus hit China around Christmas and rose exponentially until mid-February, life as we knew it is just seeing dawn three months later. 
On my discharge day, before going anywhere I had to go to my apartment leasing office, where I showed the committee a chart of my daily temperature readings and a medical professional checked my temperature so I could get a certificate saying I was ""free and clear"" from Covid-19. This qualified me for a ""green"" scan phone code that I had to show before entering any grocery store or taking public transportation. That code would have turned red if I'd gone out of town or turned off my GPS. I still carry the code and show it in some places like malls, but the requirement has become more lax. Similarly, the security guards sitting at tables outside my apartment complex have become a little less rigorous about taking my temperature every time I come and go from my apartment complex 
My first excursion was walking down the street outside of my apartment complex. About half the stores were open. The others were bolted shut, with their windows displaying ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy Year of the Rat,"" many weeks after those holidays had passed. It was an image frozen in time, waiting to melt.
I was, however, excited to be able to go to the grocery store. During my quarantine I'd texted my grocery lists to the school's office assistant and the neighborhood committee brought me the food every three days. Now at least I could get the brands I wanted. But I misjudged again: shelves were mostly empty, and I had no choice but to buy non-favorites like salted butter or sweetened yogurt. I craved a Starbucks Signature Chocolate, but the coffee chain served only carry-out orders. What would have been the point? The hot chocolate would cool down by the time I returned home and I couldn't drink it outdoors because the seating had been disassembled. 
Most of my friends were still in their home countries or doing their own quarantines here, so I couldn't see them. They also could not visit me because my apartment complex only allowed residents inside the gates. Even though I had been released from the quarantine, I was still isolated. 
Then I heard that our local Italian eatery, Mammamia, was delivering. I ordered a pizza, garlic bread and arugula salad. If I had to eat alone at home, I might as well treat myself, I thought. But when the delivery people tried to enter my gate, they could not get in and my dinner cooled as I grappled through a series of mistranslations before getting my food.
Obtaining bottled water was a challenge too. In normal times, I had a company deliver the bottles straight to my 6th floor unit. Now I had to get the heavy containers myself, risking a relapse of a shoulder injury I had just recovered from. I was beginning to feel that the only advantage to ending the quarantine was to be able to throw away my own garbage. 
At my school, we are still teaching online. Some restaurants have reopened for full service after receiving clearances from the provincial government. Now, Mammamia thoroughly checks its suppliers, takes the temperature of the staff and requires them to wear masks and gloves during service hours. As a customer, I am asked to wear a mask when I'm not eating. Tables honor social distancing policies and are set up for small groups. Malls are open, but close at 8 p.m. rather than their usual 10 or 11 p.m. to give the crew time to clean and sanitize.
Just as I thought ""normal"" was beginning to see daylight, on March 28, China closed its borders to most foreigners to avert a resurgence of Covid-19 imported from returning residents. 
As I rejoice about returning to campus in the next week or so, I mourn that the saga has shifted to America. I pray for my mother in Florida, a very social person, who must face isolation and, at age 82, falls within the high risk group. I grieve for the 3,800-plus families who must plan funerals as we speak and the 185,000 patients who are fighting for their lives. And what about my friends who work in health care? They are running out of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and find it hard to get new supplies. 
What will ""normal"" be like when it arrives? The short answer is that it will be like a roller coaster and Ferris wheel: progress will be both volatile and slow.
First, we will have to make up for lost time at our jobs. Even though many of us are lucky enough to work online, we have had to improvise. My weekly class time with students has been sliced in half, and I've had to rush through several lessons to cover all the AP exam objectives. My experience is a microcosm of what's going on in other industries. Recovery will take time.
Nevertheless, I also see opportunities. Now that we've learned that we can quickly cross over to online work, those with mobility challenges or parents who want a work-life balance may be able to avail themselves of the remote operational model. Telemedicine could streamline health care when normalcy returns. Hopefully companies will now realize the importance of providing all their employees with sick leave and health insurance.
Another important lesson we have learned from this pandemic is that no one is an island. This experience has honed our resiliency and acumen. The crisis proves that under trying circumstances, we still give our best. As many have said here in China, Jiayou (Jeye-yo), which in Chinese means, ""let's keep at it."""

The views expressed here belong to the authors. Read more opinions on CNN.
 (CNN)Access to abortion is an essential service and a fundamental human right. Period. The denial of it, including in times of global crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In the United States, the Trump administration's colossal failure to help keep people healthy and to slow the pandemic-driven implosion of the economy shouldn't come as a surprise to much of the public. He has delayed acknowledging the severity of Covid-19, prematurely hinted at an end to social distancing and over the course of his term in office, attempted to slash funding for the WHO, the CDC, and other preparedness agencies that are tasked with the monitoring of such epidemics. The list goes on and on.
But even as some states are stepping up in heroic ways where the federal government has fallen short, several states - Mississippi, Ohio, Texas and Oklahoma - have moved to limit abortion as a part of their responses to the coronavirus threat. 
All four states have classified abortions that are not a medical emergency as non-essential medical services that must be canceled or deferred, telling providers to stop performing them during the coronavirus pandemic. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week ordered that state medical providers stop all non-essential surgeries, which Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed Monday includes abortions not medically necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother; Paxton noted violations could include a penalty of up to $1,000 or 180 days of jail time. 
Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves told media Tuesday that he would take action if the state's lone clinic was providing elective abortions after the state health department ordered that non-essential surgery be postponed. In Ohio, Deputy Attorney General Jonathan Fulkerson ordered multiple abortion providers to adhere the state health director's executive order stopping non-essential procedures. Fulkerson also sent a similar letter to an Ohio urologist, and his office highlighted this when it stressed that this was not an abortion issue.) Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt suspended abortions by executive order on Tuesday, clarifying Friday that the order pertained to elective abortions. 
Covid-19 comes at a time of unprecedented backlash against abortion rights. All three of these states have sought to restrict access during the last year. Mississippi and Ohio passed so-called ""heartbeat bills"" (later blocked by federal judges) that would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy; multiple cities in Texas have declared themselves ""sanctuary cities for the unborn,"" adopting unenforceable measures purporting to outlaw abortion within city limits. 
These efforts to curb abortion rights are also happening in a global context where human rights are under assault. Here at home and around the world, the rights to gender equality, education and employment, and general well-being have come under siege. As Covid-19 has revealed the severity of inequalities around the world, some of those who will be hit hardest by the virus are women, who make up 70% of frontline workers in the health and social sectors. 
They will also be the ones hit hardest by restrictions on abortion, with little choice but to resort to unsafe and oftentimes illegal procedures. Usually in the US, the later in pregnancy the abortion, the more expensive it gets. And delays in accessing abortion service can put pregnant people outside the time limits imposed by restrictive abortion laws. Thus, in the midst of economic turmoil, to be forced to delay an abortion is simply a non-option. 
In short: now is not the time for lawmakers to put public health and safety measures like critical reproductive services last on their list of priorities.
Abortion services are essential services. Cutting back access to them violates fundamental human rights and will undoubtedly lead to a sharp increase in unsafe abortion procedures. And in a world where global health systems are already overwhelmed with Covid-19 responses, access to emergency medical care to manage the consequences of unsafe abortions will diminish further. 
The UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and Practice has noted that denial of essential women's health services, including abortion, will ""drive service provision underground into the hands of unqualified practitioners.... Persistently high maternal mortality rates often reflect a lack of investment in and under-prioritization of services required only by women."" For hundreds of thousands of women across the globe, like the coronavirus pandemic itself, access to abortion can be quite literally a matter of life or death. 
Some states in the US recognize this. Washington and Massachusetts have both taken steps to protect abortion as an essential service in light of Covid-19. Further, reproductive health experts and doctors have said that abortion is an essential service and can be provided safely during the outbreak, in the clinic and via telemedicine. 
However, those recommendations have not been heeded in Mississippi, Texas, Ohio and Oklahoma, nor at the federal level. 
These are exactly the types of actions that human rights experts have been warning about: states of emergency cannot be used to curtail fundamental human rights. Emergency declarations should never function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting people's health. 
So let's call these restrictions what they really are: an opportunistic moment for a radical right-wing agenda to restrict women's rights, which, leading up to now, we have seen in every aspect of this administrationfrom the imposition of the domestic and global gag rules, to efforts at the United Nations to block ambiguous language on sexual and reproductive rights, to the launch of the State Department's Unalienable Rights Commission, which is purported to provide ""thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights."" (We recently filed a lawsuit against the State Department and two of its officials for operating the commission in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, to which the administration has thus far not offered a public response.) 
Crises, like the one we are currently in, reveal why human rights protections are so fundamental, and as such, there's no better time than now to hold the US accountable to its commitments to human rights, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. Abortion has always been an essential, time-sensitive procedure. Now more than ever women cannot afford for conservative ideologists to forcefully cut back access to abortion services.
Women and families across the globe have dealt with enough. Governments worldwide should focus on eradicating the Covid-19 pandemic, not using it as a political weapon to undermine women's rights."

He was in his late 70s. 
Chera's real estate career began when he started buying the retail buildings that held his family's chain of children's specialty stores, holdings that became Crown Acquisitions, according to the company's website. The company eventually divested from the retail stores to focus on real estate. Crown's holdings include several iconic New York City properties, such as The St. Regis New York and the Cartier Mansion. 
Chera was also friends with President Donald Trump. 
From 2016 to 2019, Chera donated a total of $402,800 to Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and Trump Victory, organizations dedicated to supporting Trump's presidency, according to Federal Election Commission records. 
Chera's Crown Acquisitions inked a deal in 2008 with now-Trump son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner's firm The Kushner Companies and private equity firm The Carlyle Group. Crown Acquisitions and Carlyle Group took a stake in the retail portion of the building at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City, which was owned by Kushner Companies. The Fifth Avenue skyscraper ended up being a troubled property that weighed down The Kushner Companies' portfolio for years until the building sold to Brookfield Properties in 2018. 
Chera introduced Trump at the New York City Veteran's Day Parade last November, calling the president ""my dear friend."" 
Trump called out Chera at a 2019 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, describing him as ""one of the biggest builders and real estate people in the world."" 
""And he's a great guy and he's been with me from the beginning,"" Trump said of Chera.
The New York Post reported Chera's hospitalization with coronavirus on March 24. 
While Chera was known in New York as a real estate and business titan, he also was a philanthropist who funded causes like soup kitchens, the source told CNN. His ultimate philanthropic passion was aid for special needs children, the source said.
Chera was a co-founder of the nonprofit Sephardic Community Center in Brooklyn. 
He ""was a very special man, loved by all,"" the community center said in a statement. ""His devotion to so many of our community institutions is unmatched.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)South Korea, the US and the UK all reported their first Covid-19 cases around the same time: on January 20, January 21, and January 31, respectively. How things unfolded from there, unfortunately for the US and UK, has been strikingly different. 
Today, South Korea is reporting less than 100 new cases a day, the UK is reporting around 4,000 new cases a day, and the US is reporting around 30,000. But while numbers in South Korea have fallen, in the US and UK they have been rising exponentially (around 20,000 new cases a day a week ago, about 8,000 new cases a day a week before that). We don't yet know if the exponential rise in the US has been halted or not, or whether the figure will plateau at around 30,000 new cases a day. 
Nonetheless, the great success story is South Korea, and we know how they did it: they tested.
On December 31, 2019, Chinese officials informed the World Health Organization they had identified an unknown pneumonia, and on January 10, with impressive speed, Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang of Fudan University, Shanghai, published the virus's RNA sequence. (An RNA sequence can be used as the basis of a diagnostic test.)
By February 4, Kogene Biotech of Seoul had not only developed one but had also had it approved by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). And by February 10, was reporting its findings on the first 2,776 people to have been tested.
At that point, there were only 27 confirmed cases in South Korea, so -- in another impressive demonstration of speed -- the South Korean authorities tested each of them and, more importantly, isolated those who tested positive and monitored their contacts.
Initially, the authorities were swamped by the numbers of people who needed testing, but South Korean officials have tested contacts of those who have been infected. The authorities have made tests freely available and set up drive-in stations, modeled on McDonald's and Starbucks for anyone to use. Those who tested positive were then isolated, with the result that the epidemic was swiftly controlled without the country as a whole needing to be shut down. 
In the US and many other countries, however, a lack of testing kits prohibited the identification and isolation of individuals, so whole populations and whole economies have had to close down instead. By comparison, South Korea has been spared that fate partly by the government's response and partly by the swift reaction of its biotech industry.
After Kogene's test was approved, a second company, Seegene, got its own approved on February 12, and two more, SolGent and SD Biosensor, got theirs approved on February 27. 
Yet the US and many of its peers could have been prepared. 
President Barack Obama, for example, had established the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense within the National Security Council, specifically to anticipate pandemics such as Covid-19. But two years ago, the Trump administration forced out the directorate's leadership and fused its rump into a new directorate for counterproliferation.
Asked if the novel coronavirus had prompted him to reconsider his support for cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization, President Trump replied, ""I'm a business person -- I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly."" 
Yet the people who can tell Trump when he needs them are the very people he doesn't like having around. If you wait for doctors by the bedsides to tell you lots of people have fallen ill, it's too late to prevent a disease from becoming a pandemic. 
Trump's lack of seriousness, compared with South Korean President Moon Jae-in's, has been pointed.
On January 30, President Moon was saying that preventative ""measures should be strong enough to the point of being considered excessive."" Trump, on the other hand, spent most of February saying the disease was no more of a threat than the flu, that it would suddenly disappear, and would later blame the ""Fake News media"" for criticism of his response.
Britain under Boris Johnson has been as insouciant. Johnson advocated striking a balance between restrictive measures and a strategy of ""taking it on the chin,"" under which increasing numbers of people would become infected until the virus would ""move through the population.""
But, as the interviewers protested during the very interview at which Johnson revealed his strategy, his policy was bound to fail because Britain's hospitals, under its single-payer National Health Service, lacked the capacity to handle the influx.
In pursuit of efficiency, Britain's hospitals have little spare capacity, and it would take very few extra patients to swamp them. As, indeed, swiftly came to pass: Britain has instituted a virtual lockdown nationwide, while the US has issued federal guidelines on social distancing but continues to operate under a patchwork of state and local orders on what kinds of businesses can remain open and whether citizens can gather.
Neither has gone as far as China's lockdown in Wuhan, which included a ban on travel in and out of the area, unless citizens were rated as safe to move about by a phone app that tracked likelihood of infectious contact.""
South Korea was sensitive to the dangers of the virus because of the country's experience with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which spread in 2002 and 2003) and MERS (the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus of the 2015 South Korean outbreak).
In establishing the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense within the National Security Council, Obama evidently had hoped to preempt future pandemics, bringing US policy closer in line with more-prepared countries like South Korea. But perhaps he was flouting human nature. Perhaps we're not very good, as a species, in learning from the experiences of others. 
In the 1722 ""Journal of the Plague Year,"" describing the bubonic plague in London in 1665, Daniel Defoe wrote of ""the Supine Negligence of the People themselves, who during the long Notice, or Warning, they had of the Visitation, yet made no Provision for it."" When Trump recently said that Covid-19 was something ""you can never really think is going to happen,"" he may have been speaking for anyone who resists preparing for abstract dangers. 
The British populist politician Michael Gove in 2016 spoke for similar swaths in the UK when he declared that ""people in this country have had enough of experts."" Yet the one politician who has come out this crisis well is President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who listened very carefully to the experts. There may be a lesson there."

 (CNN)In the span of just a few days, autocrats around the world, using the cover of the Covid-19 outbreak, have reached for shockingly devious powers to take on extraordinary new powers. We are not talking about logical containment steps, such as the ordering of social distancing, lockdowns or contact tracing.
Think power grabs along the lines of tightening internet access, expelling a foreign journalist for her reporting on coronavirus and taking down digital content under false pretenses.
As former Obama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said after the 2008 financial crisis: ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. ... It's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.""
But there is a big difference between short-term, consensual restrictions of freedom and top-down authoritarian measures that have no expiration date -- let alone a public health justification.
Hungary's strongman gets even stronger
Nowhere is the grab for unchecked power more egregious than in Hungary. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who once likened immigration to a ""flu epidemic,"" was already on the European Union's troublemaker list after stacking the courts with loyalists and introducing legislation that criminalizes helping undocumented migrants with asylum claims.
Monday, the situation in Hungary deteriorated further, with loyal parliamentarians mustering a required two-thirds majority to allow Orban to rule by decree indefinitely and without any parliamentary oversight.
Though Orban has rejected accusations of wrongdoing, calling them ""defamatory,"" it is clear to most that Hungary's gobsmacking measures warrant a strong response. The European Union needs to drop its standard finger-waving for raw pitchfork diplomacy. Its toolbox is not entirely empty: it includes taking action to suspend the country from voting on EU decisions and slapping Orban with weighty sanctions. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, in a tweet, even suggested invoking the nuclear option and expelling Hungary from the EU.
But Hungary is by no means the only country in Europe to be accused of overreach. Hardly a day goes by where the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), my former employer, doesn't issue a statement of concern from actions it sees as unacceptable within its 57 member states. In recent days, the Austria-based organization has called out questionable Covid-19-related legislation and punitive actions in Romania, Armenia, Slovenia, Kosovo and Turkey.
Outside the European Union, policies enacted during the Covid-19 outbreak in Russia have caught the OSCE's attention, especially legislation last Tuesday that brings prison sentences of up to five years for spreading false information about the virus. While combating false information is a high priority for governments everywhere, the OSCE and other organizations say it's written without guarantees for the right of the media to report on the pandemic unconstrained and could be used as a tool to suppress free speech.
Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet at least once a year and share a well-known disdain for western liberal values as well as a negative view of Ukraine.
So, it should come as little surprise that the two strongmen borrow from the same playbook, especially when it comes to limiting the work of journalists and non-governmental organizations.
In times of crisis, the Kremlin tends to shift into overdrive to sow confusion and create division -- even more so when the major powers are distracted, as they are now. Even after Covid-19 was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization on January 30, a CNN investigation revealed that Russia was still heavily engaged in US election meddling using brilliantly disguised offshore troll farms.
And, in a worrying sign not seen since they landed on the ground in spring 2014, in eastern Ukraine OSCE monitors have been blocked by Russian-backed rebels for several days from crossing the front line on the pretext of Covid-19 ""quarantines.""
Within Russia itself, Putin, amid a rapidly-worsening Covid-19 outbreak, had planned to hold a referendum April 22 to approve revisions to the entire Russian constitution, which among other things guarantees his hold on power until 2036. The exercise has been delayed, but should the pandemic drag on, it would certainly be in the style of the Russian ruler to send his citizens to the polls during a time where low voter turnout is almost guaranteed. 
Because many areas of the world are under lockdown or some sort of movement restriction, organizing physical protests has become nearly impossible. But disgruntled citizens the world over have found creative ways -- other than merely venting their anger on social media -- to register their disgust.
In Brazil, for example, people have been pounding kitchenware for the past week in protest of far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who faces reelection in 2022. The protests are in response to their leader's casual handling of the crisis -- as well as his general style of governance. As of Thursday, the coronavirus case load in Brazil was over 8,000, according to Johns Hopkins, giving it the third-highest case load in the Americas after the United States and Canada.
But people who have had their rights trampled upon should not have to do so in isolation, even with governments and multilateral bodies under pressure to deal with the coronavirus spread and the collateral damage of economic dislocation.
If the international community stays silent while people's rights are being eroded, it sends a worrisome signal to strongmen from Brazil to Hungary that major rollbacks of civil liberties are acceptable. Worse, it gives them little motivation to repeal the measures once the public health emergency ends.
Strongmen may be deaf toward their constituents' pot-banging. But when threats of targeted and well-coordinated economic sanctions, especially aimed at those reliant on devalued petrol dollars and expulsion from coveted clubs, are dangled in front of them, it can help protect the hard-won liberties of citizens whose voices have been temporarily silenced by lockdowns, quarantines, illness and death.
The worst collateral damage from the Covid-19 pandemic is that states and leaders emerge from this with the feeling they have unchecked powers for the foreseeable future."

Krebs (@PaulaKrebs) is the executive director of the Modern Language Association. She is a former dean, professor of English, magazine editor and sportswriter. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)During the period of greatest sustained unemployment in this nation's past, the government stepped in to provide paid work that resulted in much of the rich cultural heritage Americans are able to enjoy today. 
The Works Progress Administration (WPA), created with an initial $4.9 billion appropriation in 1935 during the Depression, is commonly associated with the building of roads and bridges. 
But the WPA also employed writers, researchers, historians, artists, musicians, actors and other cultural figures and the work they did had as profound and lasting impact on the nation as the bridges and roads built by thousands of laborers. 
The original WPA recognized that culture workers were as essential to the economy as bridge builders. To respond to our current crisis, Congress should pass a further stimulus package that creates jobs directly, as did the WPA, and it should include job-creation money aimed at the arts and the humanities. As the United States confronts an unprecedented health crisis and its associated economic fallout, this moment calls for a new WPA that employs those with humanities expertise in partnership with scientists, health care practitioners, social scientists, and business, to help shape the public understanding of the changes our collective culture is undergoing. 
The cultural analysis we need is already starting: Purdue historian Kim Gallon is among other black studies scholars organizing rapid response efforts to help interpret data revealing the starkly disproportionate number of Covid-19 cases and deaths among African Americans. We need much more of that kind of analysis, and we need it in many more settings, from government to healthcare to private industry.
Those trained in the humanities philosophy, languages, literature, history, and more study ethics, and they study how representation and communication work, how cultural assumptions work, how images and words function in community and interpersonally. We need to value that training, if we are as a community to be able to weigh information, compare sources, or understand how to assess data and how to make ethical decisions. 
The WPA arose from a commitment to provide meaningful work that was good for the country, ravaged by the Depression, and so must any new WPA. The WPA's Federal Theatre Project employed more than 12,700 actors, playwrights, and theater professionals all over the country, who mounted performances that ranged from vaudeville to classic theater. Arthur Miller's first play was a FTP production, and young Orson Welles' career got a boost with his controversial all-black staging of Macbeth for the FTP's Negro Theatre Units. 
The Federal Writers' Project created work for thousands of writers, editors, and researchers; that work included the historic collection of 2,300 stories. Zora Neale Hurston was part of Florida's black FWP unit. Her work was published for the first time last year as ""Barracoon: The Story of the Last Black 'Cargo,'"" but the interviews of Americans who had been born in slavery that she and her fellow writers did for the Florida project were never published. 
The Federal Music Project, perhaps best known today for folklorists John and Alan Lomax's collections of the music of rural America, commissioned music, hired performers and conductors, and consciously set out to shape public appreciation for music, as the theater and writers' projects did for their disciplines. Hundreds of thousands of poor, working-class and middle-class Americans were introduced to or gained further appreciation for music, theater, literature, and history through WPA programs, enriching their lives and our national heritage. 
Because of what is happening to our colleges and universities in this crisis, and the structural underfunding that had started decades ago, this nation right now has thousands of unemployed researchers, analysts and writers. These arts and humanities practitioners have deep expertise that could help us understand, document and transform our culture during this emergency. Scholars of philosophy, cultural studies, ethnic studies and other humanities fields could be partnering with economists to confront the class and racial divides brought to light by the current working situation: the differences between the working-from-home, those serving them and the unemployed and uninsured. 
Experts in ethics, language and images should be helping all of us understand what's changing when we move from face-to-face interactions to virtual ones. If Zoom employed people who study sexism, racism, and extremism in US society, they might have predicted, and certainly could have acted faster and more sensitively, to the troubling 'Zoombombing' intrusions into people's work lives that we have been seeing over the last few weeks. 
Our political leaders and our business leaders should be drawing on what could be the most potent resources available for this moment: the historical knowledge and the analytical skills of those who are trained in the humanities. The original WPA provided jobs for unemployed Americans in work that would benefit the country, from trails in state parks to new symphonies and oral histories. All the work was good work, and all the products were valuable. 
The thousands of humanities scholars who are now working as adjunct labor, who have been pushed by the higher education economy into underemployment and unemployment, constitute a labor force that could wade through fast-changing cultural conditions right now and help to shape our national understanding of how our lives are changing and how we are reacting to the shifts. 
How many people are feeling unmoored by their isolation, and are trying to learn how to get their entertainment from a screen instead of through interpersonal interaction? What happens to families when you can no longer visit the grandparents? How does it change what it's acceptable to say or write when a President renames a virus to target another country or an ethic group? We as a nation must take on these questions as urgently as the question of getting the economy going again. 
With a new WPA for the humanities comparable to its New Deal predecessor, scholars and teachers could fan out into social services organizations, health care settings, public schools, and private industry as writers and researchers and as analysts of policy, text, and data. They could collect narratives of the unemployed, the service workers, the workers-from-home. They could trace the histories of the business districts that disappear, compare our current situation with other nations, and highlight and contextualize the ethical dilemmas faced by health care workers with scant resources. Humanists' work would become better understood as central to who we are and can be as a nation. 
A WPA for 2020 would bolster our country's ability to imagine a future. That future need not be either a return to a pre-Covid-19 past or an unthinking adoption of the changes caused by the disease to our working and living conditions. But it will take a combination of science, business, and the humanities to fully envision that future. Science alone, it is clear, cannot do it. Nor can economics or politics. 
To get us through the darkest moment of the American economy, FDR and the architects of the New Deal knew we needed the humanities. We need them again."

Dan Wu is a privacy counsel and legal engineer. Together, they co-founded the donation-based initiative Frontline Suits. The views expressed here are those of the authors. Read more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)As my patient lost his pulse, not one person hesitated to take action. 
A nurse jumped in to do CPR, a physician placed a breathing tube in his trachea, while another placed a large IV catheter for a rapid blood transfusion. As an emergency physician, I (Alicia) was the team leader, assigning roles and directing every action. My team had done this hundreds of times.
However, as the chest compressions spewed secretions into the air, and blood and feces soaked the bedsheets and our garments, I was aware that this resuscitation was different than the rest. This was the first cardiac arrest where we, the providers, were significantly at risk of contracting the same disease that led to his deterioration. 
In the month since then, I have cared for only critically ill Covid-19 positive patients in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Elmhurst, Queens, called the ""epicenter of the epicenter"" of the pandemic. 
Every time I lead a resuscitation, I think: How can we give our patients the best chance of survival, while also keeping the entire team safe? 
At the same time, I think about health-care workers in China and South Korea, who wear full head-to-toe protection. 
At best, our American health-care workers wear a sheer disposable gown, a mask and eye protection. Some have even taken to wearing trash bags. 
For the sake of all Americans, we must increase the standard of protective gear for health-care workers. This includes and goes beyond masks -- we must provide reusable head-to-toe protection. 
Currently, frontline health-care workers are exposed and unsafe. 
We recently conducted an informal survey of health-care workers in emergency departments and ICUs at four large New York City hospitals and so far, have gathered over 700 responses.
In the optional testimonial section included in the survey form, one emergency physician reported just one harrowing moment: ""When a ventilator circuit disconnected, there was virus spewing from this patient. I became very cognizant of my exposed neck, ears, cheeks, and arms covered by a thin layer of yellow mesh, despite having a mask and face shield. I do not want to die."" 
There is merit to these concerns. The virus is viable on surfaces for up to three days. Yet we expose our scrubs, hair and bare arms in the hospital. We carry these particles into our homes, onto subways or in cabs -- exposing our communities and families to the virus. 
To protect frontline health workers better, many countries with effective Covid-19 responses supplied their frontline with complete head-to-toe coverage. 
In China, infection rates of health-care workers were greater than three times that of the general public, according to Atul Gawande writing in the New Yorker. Once they implemented full gear and safety protocols, ""there were no further reports of infected workers,"" according to Dr. Xihong Lin, former chair of the Harvard biostatistics department. Their protection included an N95 mask, goggles, a face shield, gloves -- and a suit. In contrast, most US hospitals employ a mask, a thin gown and gloves. 
Dr. Gawande recognized the benefit of this level of protection, but because US hospitals ""don't remotely have the supplies,"" he suggested we reserve head-to-toe suits for those performing high-risk procedures, such as intubating. 
However, the reality is that at any given moment, an emergency or critical care physician might intubate a patient -- and any staff member may take similarly high-risk actions such as chest compressions during CPR. How can we protect all of our health-care workers?
We can provide frontline workers with head-to-toe coverage using washable, reusable coverall suits. These suits cover our head and neck, the entirety of our scrubs and our arms and legs. Worn underneath disposable gowns, suits can only add to the protection currently provided by scrubs. 
Instead of discarding an entire suit daily, we can more sustainably emulate the success of other countries using washable material. In fact, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations have recently moved in this direction. 
Finally, health-care workers want to wear head-to-toe suits. 
In our internal survey, 96% of over 700 health-care workers reported that they would feel safer in a washable coverall suit. 
That's why we (Alicia and Dan) have created Frontline Suits, an initiative through which we are donating over 1,000 washable suits to health-care workers across New York. We know they want even more. 
It has already changed the image -- and morale -- of many frontline workers. 
Just a few weeks ago, none of my emergency room staff were covered from head to toe. Now, after donating hundreds of suits, health-care workers wearing a suit and face shield no longer have to expose even an inch of their bodies.
The response has been overwhelmingly positive, with frontline health care workers across New York hospitals requesting the suits. 
""A suit helps reduce anxiety so we can really focus on doing our jobs,"" Dr. Nadia Solomon, a New York-based physician, told Alicia. 
Every health-care worker involved in every resuscitation should be covered from head to toe. That way, we can continue providing the best for our patients, and keep ourselves, our communities and our families safe. 
On the evening of March 16, my patient passed away. I shared tears with his family, and I recognized that I could not begin to imagine what they must be going through. I have since lost count of the number of my patients that have died due to Covid-19. 
If we want to defeat Covid-19, we cannot define what is ""proper"" protective wear based on supply limitations. 
Instead, we must create solutions to provide what is necessary to save lives."

 (CNN)Last week, I noted that we were in the calm before the storm. Now, the storm has started in the United States and is gathering strength. Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, has passed 100,000 cases globally.
There are already clusters of infection in several areas of the country. Financial markets are in turmoil, global travel is grinding to a halt, and many people worry about the safety of travel, work, school and meetings.
Covid-19 will get a lot worse before it gets better.
Nursing homes are ground zero for Covid-19
One thing stands out as the virus spreads throughout the United States: Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are ground zero. Most deaths in the United States thus far are connected to a single nursing home in Kirkland, Washington.
This is not unexpected. There have been influenza and other disease outbreaks in nursing homes in the past. Influenza causes severe nursing home outbreaks even though we have influenza vaccines and medications -- tools we lack for Covid-19. Residents in nursing homes are older and sicker and live in close quarters. Staff at these facilities are also at high risk. They are in close contact with many residents every day, and infection control is often suboptimal.
This nursing home outbreak of Covid-19 is what we call a ""sentinel event"": a warning of outbreaks and deaths that may be coming. But these deaths are not inevitable. It is essential that we protect the most vulnerable people -- those with serious underlying health conditions such as respiratory disease, cancer and diabetes and older adults. The overall case fatality ratio for Covid-19 appears to be under 1%, but is many times higher for the elderly.
The threat of rapid spread within long-term care facilities means that if we make the tough decision, now, to immediately restrict visits, we may be able to prevent many more outbreaks like the one in Kirkland. We also must ensure that any nursing home staff who are ill not come to work -- and that they receive paid leave, so they have no economic incentive to come to work if ill. Families want to visit loved ones; we should facilitate virtual visits until we know more and can do more to protect the most vulnerable.
What else can we do right now to keep Covid-19 from getting even worse?
There are other actions we can all take now to minimize further spread of Covid-19 and prevent even more societal and economic disruption.
Everybody. We must all make preventing spread of infection a top priority. That means frequent and thorough hand washing (or use of hand sanitizer), covering our coughs and staying home if we're sick. Seek medical attention if you have Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, difficulty breathing) for more than two days. And don't wear a face mask unless you have cough or fever. Outside of health care settings, a mask's main benefit is to help keep someone who is sick from infecting others. We aren't going to have enough masks, and we need to prioritize those that we have for health care workers, those caring for ill people and people who have symptoms.People who are medically vulnerable. Medical vulnerability is not about chronological age but about how healthy people are. A healthy and vigorous 79-year-old is almost certainly at lower risk than a 55-year-old with diabetes and lung disease. People who are medically vulnerable will stay safer if they avoid large-group meetings, crowded enclosed spaces (including airplanes) and they may want to telework and stay 6 feet away from others as much as possible, as well as limit the number of people they come into contact with.
Health care providers. Hospitals and other health care facilities need to prepare to surge safely. Strict infection control procedures must be implemented in all areas of every facility, including proper triage of every patient and isolation of all suspected cases. As in a busy flu year, hospitals should be ready for a surge of people with mild symptoms and the ""worried well"" -- people concerned that every cough might mean they have Covid-19. If there is lots of severe illness, it may become necessary to postpone elective surgery, train nurses to provide respiratory therapy and expand the number of patients who can be supported with intensive care. 
Society and government. We need to hear from the world's leading experts, including Drs. Anne Schuchat and Nancy Messonnier at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health. We need them to speak to us every day to keep Americans informed about what we are learning, the spread of the virus and what people can do to protect themselves. Clear, credible and consistent information about the virus and the response is urgently needed. Political leaders must take a hard look at the costs and benefits of social distancing interventions. Canceling large public gatherings, switching to telework, and considering closing schools is disruptive, but may be needed in the short term to prevent more severe longer-term impact. At a minimum, we must reduce the risk to medically vulnerably people now. 
Our understanding of Covid-19 is changing daily -- even hourly -- and we need answers to important questions so we can respond as effectively as possible. For example, it's now clear that children do get infected but rarely get sick. We don't know whether they are a major source of the spread of infection to others, and therefore whether closing schools would decrease spread as it does with influenza. We will learn more and adjust our protective actions as we do, but we know enough to take decisive steps now. What we do now and in the coming few weeks will help determine how extensively and rapidly this novel coronavirus spreads and how much death and disruption we prevent."

The guidelines are only recommendations at this point, which would be considered by the task force then submitted for Trump's approval. In recent days, the White House has said it would review recommendations and announce new guidelines early this week.
The official characterized the recommendations as a ""middle-ground agreement"" between ""keeping the country shut down and trying to reopen the entire thing."" The source would not reveal which lower-infection states might be included.
""Manhattan won't be impacted by these guidelines, but places in middle America will,"" the official said.
CNN has reached out to the White House, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has not yet received responses.
The proposed recommendations call for cities to reach ""benchmarks"" before allowing people to go back to school, return to daycare or go back to work, ""... while still implementing social distancing measures."" The official did not offer any specifics about the benchmarks but did say that ""state and local agencies will have to work together to decide what is best for their communities.""
The recommendations allow for ""schools to open first,"" the source said. ""This is what we should have done in the first place. Some schools should have never closed.""
Under the proposed return-to-work recommendations, ""businesses would be recommended to try a phased approach.""
""Those who are more vulnerable and at higher risk of contracting [the disease] will be recommended to telework, those who are younger ... those who are non-immune compromised, those who are healthy are going to be asked to phase back into the workplace,"" the official said. Those ""severely ill, anyone showing symptoms, or people who are at higher risk should continue to stay home.""
The official stressed that these would be ""guidelines"" and that it would be up to individual state and local officials to decide how to move forward.
""We can't have everything open and we can't continue to tell people to stay inside,"" the source said. ""Continuing the pause like we have been is not sustainable socially. It's not sustainable economically.""
Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News Saturday night that ""we are following the data"" as the task force prepares to release guidelines.
""We are literally doing tens of thousands of tests a day,"" Pence said. ""And we've got a great deal more understanding about where people have contracted the coronavirus, who has recovered, who is most at risk and the regions of the country most impacted. So, while the President has said that he would like to open the country up in weeks, not months, we are going to be bringing that data forward to him.""
When asked about the risk posed to the general public and how the recommendations would be received, the senior federal health official told CNN: ""There is going to be risk."""

""It is dangerous for him to continue calling it the Chinese coronavirus,"" Rep. Judy Chu, a California Democrat and the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, told CNN's Victor Blackwell on Saturday. ""He is creating more xenophobia every single time he does that. And we can see the results in what's happening to Asian Americans across this country.""
The congresswoman pointed to recently reported incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including a woman wearing a mask assaulted at a New York City subway station, a teenage boy in Los Angeles County beaten up by bullies who accused him of having coronavirus, and a family of four in Texas stabbed while trying to buy groceries amid the pandemic. ""So it's a very serious situation, especially in a time of heightened emotion,"" Chu told Blackwell Saturday.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
While Trump began using the term during news briefings on coronavirus this month -- and the incidents mentioned by Chu date to as early as the beginning of February -- some Republican lawmakers and administration officials earlier referred to Covid-19 as the ""Chinese coronavirus,"" ""the Chinese virus,"" or ""the Wuhan virus"" after the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the official terminology for the virus.
Trump has repeatedly called coronavirus ""the China virus"" or ""the Chinese virus"" during White House news briefings this month on the pandemic instead of using the official name from WHO and the CDC. And the President again referred to the virus that way during a Saturday briefing with reporters. After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined the terms are both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing.
The President has defended his use of the term, denying it's racist or stigmatizing.
""It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate,"" Trump said on Wednesday.
Trump claims he's using the term because the Chinese government has attempted to blame the virus on US soldiers. CNN previously reported that a prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the US military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China and that it did not originate in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
""China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So, I think it's a very accurate term,"" Trump said Tuesday, adding, ""I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.""
WHO announced on February 11 that it would be referring to the novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan, China, as Covid-19.
""Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine,"" the CDC website says.
The website adds that stigma ""is associated with a lack of knowledge"" about how Covid-19 spreads, ""a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.""
The CDC's advice to help stop stigma: ""Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.""
In 2015, the WHO issued best practices for naming new human infectious diseases that advised avoiding the use of geographic locations. 
The organization acknowledged that the name ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"" or MERS, ""has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors.""
""This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected,"" Dr Keiji Fukuda, the then-assistant director-general for WHO's health security, said in a statement at the time.

 (CNN)Different times call for different measures. When Covid-19 hit China, I was concerned, as were many public health professionals, about what could happen and urged rapid action to understand more and prepare. But few of us anticipated the catastrophic impact the new virus has had in Wuhan, in Italy and may soon have in many other places.
For most people, there is simply no frame of reference for this pandemic. Never in our lifetime has there been an infectious disease threat as devastating to society. Never in our lifetime have we seen a rich country like Italy face the need to ration respirators. And never have we seen the fear that millions of health care workers around the world feel about being infected by the virus -- justified fear we must address. 
What we're learning about the novel coronavirus
We learn more about this virus by the day, often by the hour and most of the news is bad. Here are five things we've learned in the past week:
<ul><li>The virus is much more infectious than influenza or the SARS virus, which it closely resembles. This week, new data showed that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can live on contaminated surfaces as the SARS virus can, so it may spread, sometimes explosively, from doorknobs, elevator buttons and contaminated surfaces in hospitals and elsewhere. But we also learned that, unlike SARS, patients become highly infectious before they become seriously ill, explaining at least in part why Covid-19 acts like a super-SARS, far more infectious than its vanquished cousin.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It's not just older people with underlying conditions who become very ill and can die. Younger adults, previously healthy people and some children develop viral pneumonia. Although prior reports suggested that 80% of people got only mild disease, it now appears that about half of these people, despite not needing hospital admission, have moderately severe pneumonia, which can take weeks or longer to recover from.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Explosive spread will almost certainly overwhelm health care capacity in New York City and elsewhere, and lead to the inability to save patients who could otherwise have been saved. Today's severe cases are in people infected 10 to 14 days ago who got sick five to six days ago and have steadily rogressed to severe illness. That means cases will continue to skyrocket for weeks after spread stops. Not only won't there be enough ventilators, there won't be enough supplies for the ventilators, hospital beds to support patients -- or health care workers to help patients.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Health care workers are in peril. Thousands were infected in China, more than 3,000 have been infected in Italy, protective equipment is in short supply in the United States, and as health care becomes overwhelmed, it becomes harder to provide care safely.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It's going to get a lot worse. Not only is the global economy in free-fall but supply chains for essentials, including medicines, are disrupted. Even China, which has successfully tamped down spread, is only now reopening its economy -- which produces components of many medicines people rely on -- and very slowly.</li></ul>
This is a war. And in war, strategy is important. The leading concept, now remarkably widely understood, is flattening the curve. This is an important tactic to protect patients and health care workers from a surge that can overwhelm our hospitals, increase death rates and put health care workers' lives at risk. But it is not a strategy. A month ago today, my organization, which focuses on preventing epidemics, published a concept of operations showing the shading of containment into mitigation, and the need to pause contact tracing when it became impractical and scale up social distancing interventions (see link for details.)
Today, learning from another month of experience from around the world, particularly China and South Korea, we recognize a third phase of the response: suppression of episodic outbreaks. In this new third phase, extensive testing and alert clinical systems can identify cases and clusters promptly, intervene extensively and suppress spread before widespread societal harms occur.
The revised approach also recognizes that this is going to be a long war, and that we need to address the extensive risks to societal continuity, including health care for people with ongoing medical needs such as hypertension and diabetes, and the vulnerability of the supply chain for medicines and supplies.
China has outlined an analogous approach, based in part on their experience with cases re-imported from other parts of the world. In China, Hubei province faced a peak that overwhelmed health care services, but other provinces were able to avoid this through aggressive containment (the purple curve below). China remains largely locked down, with only gradual reopening, and is urgently expanding health care capacity, preparing for possible clusters or larger outbreaks in the future. 
There are five priorities essential for successful implementation of the third phase of this strategy.
Extensive testing and contact tracing. China has tested millions of people and traced more than 685,000 contacts. Contact tracing requires skilled public health professionals -- and sophisticated data management. Testing is required in multiple venues:
<ul><li>Health care facilities. Every patient with fever or cough and every patient requiring mechanical ventilation or with signs or symptoms of pneumonia.</li><li>Contact tracing. An army of skilled public health workers, potentially empowered by new data streams such as cell phone location trails, are needed to identify exposed people, who must be isolated for 14 days after exposure. How widely a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test contacts will depend on emerging information about who spreads the infection and when in the course of their illness.</li><li>Drive-through. Quick, safe, convenient drive-through testing facilities, as pioneered by South Korea, reduce the burden on health care facilities, reduce the risk to health care workers and others who patients may come into contact with, and identify infections among contacts and others. </li><li>Surveillance. We need tracking systems, including the Influenza-Like Illness system, to find spread and monitor trends. Syndromic surveillance systems will need to be tuned to detect possible clusters, and signals investigated immediately.</li></ul>
Prepare for health care to surge safely. Every community in the country needs to ramp up the ability to safely care for large number of patients with minimal risk to health care staff. This means not only flexing up the number of beds and availability of oxygen and ventilators, but every aspect of health care including staffing, equipment, supplies and overall management. 
Preserve health and routine health care functions. We need to increase the resilience of both our people and our health care facilities, as rapidly as possible. 
<ul><li>Increase personal health resilience. Underlying conditions greatly increase the risk of severe illness. This isn't just bad for patients who get infected, it will take up scarce health care facilities. There has never been a better time to quit smoking, get your blood pressure under control, make sure that if you have diabetes it's well controlled, and -- yes -- get regular physical activity. (Being active outside for at least 15 minutes a day also helps with vitamin D levels. Of all of the various proposed measures to increase your resistance to infection, regular physical activity and adequate vitamin D levels probably have the most scientific evidence to support them -- and can be done safely.)</li><li>Massively scale up telemedicine. We need to reduce the number of people attending health care facilities while at the same time preserving and improving health. The Administration issued flexible and constructive guidelines for Medicaid, but much more is needed. Patients -- especially those who are uninsured or who don't have a regular source of care -- need to be able to refill prescriptions, get medical advice and find a clinician readily. </li><li> Fix supply chain weaknesses. This is crucial for masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and supplies for ventilators, and laboratory materials. This is a good time to look at a core list of medications and ensure that the safest and most effective ones are available. For example, in another area where my group works globally, we've discovered that instead of 30 or 50 medications for high blood pressure, three would do for nearly all patients. Let's make sure we have life-saving medicines and worry less about which companies are making them.</li></ul>
Learn intensively. If there is one key lesson from past epidemics, it's that getting real-time data is essential for a great epidemic response. 
<ul><li>Most urgently, we must learn how best to protect health care workers from infection. </li><li>We need to know who is most at risk for spreading the infection, and at what point in their illness -- so that we can target contact tracing most effectively. This will help determine how wide a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test. </li><li>Who is at the highest risk for severe illness and death. </li><li>What works to reduce infection? What public health advice is being followed, and what is the impact? Some countries require that all patients, even those with mild illness, are isolated in facilities. (This could be done, for example, in college dormitories). Is this necessary and effective? Should it be extended to close contacts to prevent them from spreading the infection? The answer to these questions will depend in part on answers to other questions, such as how often people who never have symptoms, or people who are just beginning to get sick, spread infection. </li><li>Are there rapid point-of-care tests and how accurate and timely are blood tests for coronavirus infection?</li><li>Is immunity protective? Even if antibodies are reliably produced, this doesn't necessarily mean that recovered patients are immune from a future infection.</li></ul>
For these questions, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments, as well as public health agencies around the world, are crucial. They are the intelligence officers needed to guide our strategy and tactics, and they need to be both at the table when decisions are made and at the podium when policies are explained
And these are just the epidemiological questions. We also urgently need to know whether treatments work. The preliminary report on the value of chloroquine and azithromycin needs to be rigorously addressed. The disappointing finding that two anti-viral medications didn't improve survival in severely ill patients is a sobering reminder that until there are rigorous studies, we won't know how best to treat patients. Even if we can't dramatically improve outcomes, a treatment that reduces the need for intubation could save many lives.
A safe and effective vaccine is of greatest importance. The world must do everything possible to develop a vaccine, while also recognizing that this may or may not be possible.
Adapt to a new normal. The Covid-19 pandemic will change our world forever. Until it is controlled, we will all need to change how we wash our hands, cover our coughs, greet others and how close we come to others. We will rethink the need for meetings and conferences. We will need broadband for all as a public utility like mail or water. We will need to support the vulnerable, even if only because their illness can risk our health.
Our strategy to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 will necessarily evolve as we learn more about the virus and the effectiveness of different interventions. 
In a fourth phase, a vaccine, if one can be found, or global elimination efforts, if they can succeed, would either end the pandemic or, if not, force us to adapt to the continuing threat for the indefinite future. We face weeks and months of fear and tragedy. Leaders at every level must be frank that this is frightening, unprecedented and irrevocably changes how we provide care and prepare for the future. But it is also a time to recognize that we are all in this together -- not only all in the United States, but all of us globally. Spread anywhere in the world increases risk everywhere. We have a common enemy, and, working together with a common strategy, we can build a new normal that minimizes risk, maximizes collaboration and commits to shared progress."

The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)Not long ago, my colleagues and I swore the Hippocratic Oath, which requires new physicians to uphold the highest ethical standards.
Now during what is likely the most significant health crisis in American history in the Covid-19 pandemic, the Service Employees International Union's Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR), which represents more than 17,000 interns, residents, and fellows across the United States, is demanding a bill of rights for resident physicians.
It would guarantee better working conditions, a living wage, and sick and family leave. We are also demanding no more than 80 working hours per week. If you think you read incorrectly, you did not. Many of us are currently working well beyond reasonable hours, and under grueling conditions. 
With America now leading the world in the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, we are facing the most critical medical challenge in a century. But the cohort of medical professionals who are the heartbeat of the US health care system hospital interns, residents and fellows included is under a massive assault as they fight the disease. In the absence of a vaccine, the best protection the nation has is the protection of frontline medical professionals. That's why we urgently need a resident physicians bill of rights. 
Interns are doctors who have recently completed medical school, are in their first year of post-medical school training and cannot practice medicine unsupervised. Residents can practice as general practitioners and receive further training to learn specialized skills. Resident physicians face numerous challenges in their work and are often exploited; they earn low wages, work extraordinarily long shifts and often experience burnout. 
The Committee of Interns and Residents is calling on the health care industry, especially hospitals, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), specialty boards and elected officials, to acknowledge the rights of these young physicians. A bill of rights whose principles are enforced by US law can hold medical institutions accountable. Graduate medical education is currently self-governed by ACGME and individual institutions and needs external oversight to accomplish any real reform. The ACGME should institute the bill of rights, and there should be external enforcement by the US government.
A bill of rights would make our wellness a priority. Right now, many of us face inadequate staffing and support, stagnant wages, bureaucratic dysfunction and unequal or declining access to our own care. Even as we work hours above and beyond most full-time workers, we are not considered full-time employees, and are denied the opportunity to unionize and negotiate a better way forward. 
Too often the rights of these men and women who sacrifice their own well-being to care for others are denied. Hospitals are facing severe shortages in personal protective equipment, ventilators, and ICU beds, and more and more health care workers are becoming infected. US schools are joining European countries graduating or considering graduating final-year medical students to join the ranks of the coronavirus fight. 
In turn, it's time for society to ensure the highest quality protection for health care employees. The efficiency and success of care begins with acknowledging the needs of those performing life-saving medicine. We are at patients' bedsides in the ICU. We perform intubations and connect people to IVs. We read test results and write admission notes and discharge summaries.
First-year medical residents work up to 28-hour shifts, literally not sleeping. They are on the floors for 24 hours, and then the remaining four hours are spent on education, patient safety/quality improvement, and reporting patient status to the following team. In my experience and that of our members, these shifts occur every fourth night. There is an 80-hour cap on resident work weeks, but national studies demonstrate that residents underreport their working hours 60% of the time on average, largely to complete administrative tasks. 
Many resident physicians face huge financial burdens and must pay off student loans. The average medical student graduates with $200,000 of debt. Moreover, the number of patients admitted at teaching hospitals rose 46% from 1990 to 2010, even though the number of residency spots increased only 13%. The pressures of the job take an enormous toll on physicians' physical and emotional well-being.
According to surveys and academic literature, doctors are twice as likely to commit suicide than those in other professions. One in 10 fourth-year medical students and first-year resident physicians report having suicidal thoughts, according to SEIU's collection of data from members and medical journals. More than a quarter report having fallen asleep at the wheel after being on call, according to the same data collection. 
The unprecedented nature of this crisis the need for sophisticated protective measures and a shortage of supplies and medicines means increased vulnerability for already fatigued staff. That puts patients at greater risk than ever. 
We must move rapidly to revitalize frontline workers, bolster their mental preparedness, and teach essential new critical skills. It's time to fortify these rights for the future, as fundamental principles of equity. Establishing these rights will result in a more robust health care system prepared to conquer Covid-19 and the generation of health challenges it will bring."

 (CNN)Donald Trump's coronavirus test came back negative after his exposure to an infected Brazilian official. But that doesn't guarantee a clean Covid-19 bill of health going forward. Because of the President's ongoing contact with countless numbers of people -- including White House staff -- he should be regularly screened and tested as appropriate. 
Hopefully, he will now start following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to avoid turning the White House into a hot spot for infection. 
The White House indeed showed some signs of added caution this weekend.
On Sunday, a doctor took the temperatures of the coronavirus task force members before they met and on Saturday journalists had to be checked for fever minutes before entering the briefing room for Trump's press conference. It's unclear if this new screening process will be applied consistently to White House staff, but in a time of crisis it is prudent to try to mitigate risk.
Overall, it's clear that Trump has taken unnecessary risks both with his own health and those around him by his refusal to get expeditiously tested after a confirmed exposure. Doctors have warned that people can be infected without running a fever. 
A President's health is paramount -- it is critical to his ability to fully perform his responsibilities. Given the close quarters at the White House, it is imperative that the President protects himself and safeguards the health of those around him, whether it be staff, members of the American public or high-level foreign officials. POTUS as virus spreader is a situation everyone should want to avoid.
Even absent a pandemic, a president should be regularly monitored and screened for infection. I know from personal experience that the President is usually accompanied by a physician when he travels. During a health crisis like Covid-19, the President should be extra cautious about protecting himself from exposure and getting regularly screened and tested in line with existing guidelines.
Any president should lead by example -- especially during a crisis.
Instead, this time around, we have a President flouting the guidance the CDC is giving to millions of Americans. At 73, he's part of a high-risk group. Yet he resisted getting tested immediately despite being in close contact with people with the virus. His physician claimed he did not need to get checked (although the White House now says that he did) or self-quarantine because he wasn't showing symptoms -- despite the CDC and other officials saying that some patients are asymptomatic.
And, with millions of people watching during a press conference on coronavirus, on Friday he personally engaged in the very behavior the CDC is warning against, like shaking hands and standing very close to people.
He may have tweeted on Saturday about ""social distancing"" but he's doing just the opposite. At all times, and especially during a complex crisis, presidential actions speak louder than words (or tweets).
 It's fortunate for all who had contact with him that he reportedly tested negative, but trying to imagine what would happen if Americans followed the President's lead is terrifying.
 If anyone wants misinformation during this national emergency, they need go no further than Twitter feed or the statements he makes at press conferences. Every day, he is sharing inaccurate information and lying about his own administration's strategy, as well as the actions of his perceived rivals, including his predecessor President Barack Obama
Whether it's talking about websites and tests that aren't widely available, or getting key details about a travel ban wrong, Trump poses health hazard to the American people. By failing to communicate clear and accurate information, he's confusing people about where and how to get potentially lifesaving testing.
A president should reassure the public during a crisis, not cause panic.
Nor is he showing any accountability. On Friday, he said he has no responsibility when it comes to our lack of preparedness -- even though this is happening on his watch. Plus, when pressed about why he closed the White House National Security Council directorate for global health and security -- charged with preventing and preparing for the next pandemic -- he threw his team under the bus, saying he personally didn't shut the office and pointing the finger at the people, rather than acknowledging any knowledge about why the office was shut down.
Back in February, he said the office was no longer needed. The office was shut down pursuant to guidance from then national security adviser John Bolton -- and typically presidents are briefed about NSC reorganizations. 
Trump broadcasting his lack of knowledge about key staff decisions isn't helpful and it doesn't address the fact that since the directorate was shut down in 2018 he hasn't pushed to increase personnel despite public warnings about pandemics -- including from the intelligence community -- over the last few years. Trump's scapegoating members of his own team just doesn't cut it -- he was grossly negligent when it came to getting ready for a new virus.
Presidents are entrusted to keep their citizens safe. When millions of Americans vote in November, they should consider whether they want to reelect a man who so willfully could put their health at risk."

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Friday that interest rates would be cut only if the coronavirus worsened, the latest sign the central bank would maintain a wait-and-see approach to the outbreak.
""Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time,"" Bullard said in remarks prepared for a presentation in Arkansas. 
Other policymakers have said they would closely monitor the respiratory illness COVID-19 but emphasized it was too soon to determine whether the central bank would need to step in. Stocks suffered their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis after the government warned on Tuesday that it would almost certainly spread through communities in the US. 
The World Health Organization has warned that the illness, which rapidly spread to more than four dozen countries over a period of days, has the potential to be labeled a pandemic. With stringent restrictions on travel and commerce and growing concerns about the outbreak, economists have lowered growth forecasts sharply for the year. 
Wall Street expectations for rate cuts have risen dramatically in recent days. Markets are currently pricing in a 100% chance that the central bank will lower its benchmark interest rate in March, according to the closely watched CME FedWatch tool."

Only 7% said they felt the government is ""extremely prepared,"" while 12% said ""very prepared.""
Comparatively, 24% said ""not so prepared"" and 16% said ""not prepared at all.""
Here's a full breakdown of how Americans responded to the question of how prepared they feel the US government is for coronavirus:

The Trump administration has faced bipartisan criticism as it's sought to downplay the potential impact of coronavirus in the US, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the spread is inevitable and Americans should prepare for ""severe"" disruptions. 
Trump has tapped Vice President Mike Pence to handle the government's approach to the crisis, but this has not raised confidence levels among congressional Democrats and experts who point to Pence's record of ignoring science during his time as governor of Indiana.

As with the NASCAR event, this is prompted in part by desperation. The absence of conventional sports has left Fox without much of its live programming. While the situation isn't as dire as it is for stock car racing (the NFL season isn't due to start for months), this gives Fox something to reel in viewers who'd otherwise have to wait a while to see live sports. If the Madden tourney is successful, it could lead to more virtual sports during the downtime and might expose many more people to esports."

Health officials in Snohomish County, Washington, said the student became ill Monday with a fever, body aches and a headache. He was seen at two different clinics in the county, however, as the student felt better, they attempted to return to Jackson High School on Friday.
Coronavirus test results for the student, officials said, then came back ""presumptive positive,"" and the student returned home before attending class.
""The individual is currently in home isolation and is doing well,"" Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District, said at a press conference Friday.
Spitters said the student did not travel to areas associated with coronavirus outbreaks, nor did they have known contact with someone diagnosed with the virus. This means the student is the fourth known U.S. case of community spread, which means a person who is diagnosed with a virus without having known contact with an area or person associated with the virus.

The school district, health officials said, has notified students and staff that may have had close contact with the infected student. Most of them will be quarantined at home for 14 days and the school will be sanitized over the weekend and be closed on Monday.
The student was the second person in the state diagnosed with COVID-19 Friday. A woman in her 50s returned from traveling in Daegu, South Korea, on Sunday, Feb. 23. She returned to work on Tuesday, where she had symptoms by the end of the day, according to Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health Seattle &amp; King County.
A majority of the more than 2,300 positive coronavirus cases in South Korea have been linked to a secretive religious sect in the city of Daegu.
Duchin said the woman's COVID-19 test results came back preliminary positive on Thursday.
""Given the extent of global spread, we expect to identify more individuals with COVID-19 in Washington,"" Washington state Health Officer Dr. Kathy Lofy said in a statement Friday.
The coronavirus, which the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, has led to 2,924 deaths, among more than 85,000 cases globally.
Oregon school employee on Friday was diagnosed with a case of coronavirus with an unknown origin. That person joined two others in California who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 through community spread this week.
In the U.S., there are 66 patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, most of which are from those repatriated from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked off the coast of Japan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 62 confirmed cases; four ""unconfirmed"" patients tested positive in their states and those results need to be confirmed by the CDC before being included in its numbers.
In California, the city of Costa Mesa won a battle against the federal government Friday night when it withdrew its request to transfer infected coronavirus patients from the Diamond Princess to a quarantine facility in the town.
""This is a victory for the citizens of Costa Mesa and Orange County,"" Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said in a statement Friday night. ""But the government has not promised not to place future infected persons there, so the battle is not over.""
Without much warning, and no input, last week, the city said it learned people with COVID-19 would be transferred to a soon to be designated quarantine facility. It quickly filed suit to halt the transfers.
""We continue to be troubled by the lack of information from the agencies we all need to trust to keep us safe,"" Foley said. ""While the risk of infection is low, this is an international public health emergency and we need answers.""

At least 70 cases and one death have been detected in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here is how the situation is unfolding on Saturday (all times eastern).
10:12 a.m. 1st presumptive case of coronavirus detected in Rhode Island
The Rhode Island Department of Health has announced the first presumptive positive case of coronavirus in the state.
The patient is in his or her 40s and had traveled to Italy in mid-February and had limited travel within the state -- and not returned to work -- since arriving back in the U.S., according to the health agency.
All infection protocols are being followed at the hospital where the patient is being treated.
""The Rhode Island Department of Health has been preparing for weeks to ensure that we have a structure in place to, to the best of our ability, limit or prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island. We fully anticipated having a first case of COVID-19,"" said Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, in a statement. ""We are not seeing widespread community transmission in Rhode Island, and the general level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low. However, everyone in Rhode Island has a role to play in helping us prevent the spread of viruses, just like the flu. It is very important that people wash their hands regularly, cover their coughs and sneezes, and stay home if they are sick.""
9:19 a.m. U.S. Surgeon General releases information to ""stop the spread of rumors""
The U.S. Surgeon General has released a thread of information on Twitter to prevent the spread of misinformation on the coronavirus.
The first issue the agency tackled was the apparent racism against Asian Americans that has been spreading as a result of the virus.
""Diseases can make anyone sick regardless of their race or ethnicity,"" the tweet read. ""People of Asian descent, including Chinese Americans, are not more likely to get COVID19 than any other American.""
The Surgeon General also said that while the disease is serious, immediate health risk to the general public is ""considered low"" and reminded people to know the signs and symptoms of the virus as well as the steps to take to keep you and those around you safe.
Earlier
One death has been recorded in the U.S. after a man in his 50s succumbed to the virus in Washington State, officials announced on Saturday.
Washington state is also looking into a number of illnesses at a long-term care facility, health officials said.
There have been 87,138 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in at least 60 countries and 2,980 deaths, according to the latest figures released by WHO.
On Sunday, Iran's Health Ministry raised the number of people who died from the virus to 54 after the tally of infected jumped overnight to 978, The Associated Press reported.
Symptoms of the coronavirus are similar to pneumonia, and can range from mild symptoms, like a slight cough, to more severe symptoms, including fever and difficulty breathing, according to the CDC.
The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person -- likely within close contact of at least 6 feet.
The CDC doesnt currently recommend any healthy person wear a face mask, as fiddling with the mask could risk more exposure of hands to the face.

<ul><li>
 It may not look like much, but here is a small slice of cinematic and social normalcy in these crazy times: the Blue Starlite Mini Urban Drive-in. 
</li><li>
 The poster for an unusual event: some genuine big film-festival premieres at your neighborhood drive-in. 
</li></ul>
AUSTIN, TexasFor a brief period of time on Tuesday evening, the debates in one particular part of East Austin could be blissfully trivial again: sit inside or outside? Want Milk Duds or Buncha Crunch?
And which one was bestthe one about the pregnancy or the one involving waffles?
The rapidly evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, aka the coronavirus, has impacted seemingly everyone and everything by this point in time. But among those impacted by this virus, the film fraternity in Central Texas stood as one of the first US communities hit hard in the public spotlight. On March 6, Austin Mayor Steve Adler walked to the podium and declared the state of emergency that effectively canceled South by Southwest for the first time in the festival's 34-year history. And within days, health officials rapidly shrank recommended gathering sizes from 2,500 to 250 to 50 to no more than 10. Fans, filmmakers, and everyone in the broader industry both here and afar suddenly not only lost one of their annual linchpins for business and pleasure, they lost virtually all cinematic experiences.
So the day after Adler's proclamation, Josh Frank floated his idea on Facebook. Any filmmakers want to still air their stuff at my drive-in? Twenty-plus emails and 10 days later, the Blue Starlite Mini Urban Drive-In opened up its screen this week for the first of four evenings of ""SXSocial Distance: A Night of Short Films.""
""Originally I was going to put the Facebook post up and, if no filmmakers reached out, I was going to let it go,"" Frank, the founder and owner of the Blue Starlite, tells Ars. ""But Tim [Norfolk, one of only a handful of drive-in employees] was so enthusiastic about the idea, it made me more enthusiasticI guess this kind of matters, it's not a throwaway idea.
""So I kind of expected this to happen, but the feature [films] didn't write back. Features aren't going to do a throwaway event because festivals want to say it's the world premiere or the US premiere. But I started getting emails back from the shorts, which makes sense. Those are the guys that are the most fucked. They have the hardest time getting any attention, and this festival and the newsworthiness of that premiere would've been huge to them. So they realized it could be salvaged: they could still show their movies in Austin and also do something newsworthy. Maybe they didn't get to show at SXSW, but a drive-in offered its screens.""
A brief visual history of the Blue Starlite in Austin
After founding the space in 2010, Frank and the Blue Starlite team entered this year ready to celebrate their 10th anniversary in the fall. With two adult passes and a BYO-everything car costing just north of $20, it's always been among the more affordable places to catch a film. But now, out of roughly 5,800 movie theaters in the United States (approximately 320 of which are drive-ins), this venue remains one of only places in the country to catch a movie outside of your home, period.
""I never thought I'd say this, but we're literally the only movie theater operating in Austin, Texas, and the surrounding areas. I never expected that to be the truth,"" Frank says. ""In a lot of people's minds, it kind of revalidated what a drive-in could be for society.""
If you've ever been to a drive-in, however, the Blue Starlite likely represents something different. Yes, you still tune your FM dials and can find some concessions in a trailer off to the side. But it's almost as if someone had ample amounts of central Texas ranchland and invited their larger network over to enjoy a backyard projector. Frank rents land tucked away between a newly built neighborhood and a Moose Lodge and fits in as many screens as he can (the central Austin location currently has three, so there's a variety of showings every night). Any visions of a few hundred cars packed in on top of each other decidedly isn't Blue Starlite's style. Instead, normal capacity for the biggest screen only sits around 30 cars, and even that has been scaled back for now.
""The idea was always to have a drive-in on a human scalethe drive-in as old needed to be big, but the drive-in as new needed to be small so it could fit into the city,"" Frank explains. ""And it turns out the idea of small, with what we're going through right now, it's exactly what's needed. Not just an outdoor movie. Not just a movie in a car. When you have a drive-in that's only 20-30 cars, everyone that comes in gets to feel it's their special night. But with what's going on, small also means people can feel a little more safe, a little comfortable.""

On Wednesday afternoon, the company announced it’s up to 50 million, 21 million more than the last numbers it reported, two months ago. That’s also well ahead of the pace it pitched to investors, which projected between 60 to 90 million customers in 2024.

Foxconn's contentious Wisconsin plant will be used to make ventilators
The Taiwanese company has partnered with healthcare company Medtronic.
Foxconn’s dubious Wisconsin factory — the subject of billions of dollars of tax subsidy scrutiny — will produce ventilators to aid in COVID-19 treatment in the US. The company, best known for assembling Apple’s iPhones at factories in China, has entered into a partnership with healthcare firm Medtronic for the project, which will see ventilators produced “as soon as possible,” according to a statement provided to Reuters.
The factory was first announced back in 2017 and has been the focus of controversy ever since. While its arrival promised new job opportunities for the state and was initially earmarked for use as an LCD factory, plans have repeatedly changed. Those ample job opportunities never materialized. Meanwhile, the plant has picked up more than $4.5 billion in government incentives.Continue reading.

He’d considered the service before, but as Walker had been following news about the coronavirus and tracking what other retailers such as H-E-B and Wal-Mart were doing, he made a call and consulted his board of directors. By the end of the week, he and Barde had a deal; Enviro-Master would be cleaning GAMA’s headquarters and 550 partner stores.
Walker has lots of good reasons to be scared about the spread of COVID-19.
His wife, a school administrator, has diabetes, putting her at high risk for COVID-19. “When I go home, I don’t give my wife a kiss and a hug today,” he says, “I have a spot in my closet where my clothes go in the wash. I jump in the shower before I touch anything in the house.”
His parents, Winter Texans originally from Illinois, also have immunity issues. “I’m like, we have to change what we do. But for how long? Who knows? Who knows?”
“I have a spot in my closet where my clothes go in the wash. I jump in the shower before I touch anything in the house.”
Walker describes watching a press conference in which the mayor of Austin said making decisions amid the coronavirus crisis was a process of doing things that won’t screw us up the most. “As soon as I heard, that I turned to my wife and said that’s my frustration. I hate operating that way. Everything is so reactive.”
By bringing in the spray team, Walker says he’s able to feel more comfortable moving around the warehouse, leaning on boxes, touching things, even accepting a gift (that he planned to pay for) from his workers: a shopping cart full of toilet paper.
“When employees see that you’re taking steps to keep them safe, it’s making them think twice about wanting to just bail on their job,” Walker said.
Hernandez and Lindsey, who are both in their mid-20s, have adjusted their schedules to the flood of new business. Their early-morning-to-afternoon shifts now sometimes include weekend appointments and middle-of-the-night work. As they work, they say, they’re running through a mental checklist and determining what touch points need the most attention. Doorknobs, light switches, ice machine covers, vending machine buttons, ladders, lottery-ticket stations, vehicle dashboards; these are all high-touch areas that get a good spraying.
The hourly rate they make is $12.60, but it’s not unusual to make more than $1,000 per paycheck every two weeks working for the company with commissions, they said. By comparison, the average industry wage in the commercial janitorial industry last year was just over $16,000.
Both say they’ve been fielding questions from family and friends about the work they do. “My older sister, my mother and wife, they all have been kind of worried about me,” Lindsey said. “But I’m pretty committed. I’ve been building my immune system and following the safety protocol. There’s no pressure for me to quit, they just want me to be safe.”
Hernandez has a fiancée who is a nurse at a community medical center. They are both trying to stay healthy and frequently compare notes on what’s happening with COVID-19. “If we get sick, who’s going to go out there and provide the service for all these places?”
One of the perks of working for the company is that employees can use the sprayers at home and in their vehicles and can use the company’s chemicals to wash their clothes. “We spray everything, the bathrooms, the closets,” Hernandez said. “It’s always better to be safe than sorry.”"

""This person appears to be a community-acquired case of coronavirus, which would be the first here in the United States,"" Bela Matyas, the Solano County health officer, said in a press conference on Thursday. He added, however, that he doesn't think this is the only such case. 
""There are probably cases of coronavirus from community acquisition in multiple parts of the country right now,"" Matyas said.
That means the virus is likely spreading undetected in the US, according to Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Adalja offered a simple definition of community spread:
""'Community spread' reflects the fact that the virus is out there in the community spreading from person to person, meaning that it's not just spreading from people who had contact with someone from China or a travel history, but that it's something established in the community,"" he said.
That reality, Matyas said, means health officials have to transition ""from trying to contain the disease to more of a mitigation approach.""
A delay in detection 
The California patient is now in serious condition, according to CNN.
She initially went to the NorthBay VacaValley Hospital on February 15. The 50-bed hospital is in Solano County, which is also home to the Travis Air Force Base, where some Americans evacuated from China and from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have been quarantined.
A surgeon at the base, who requested that he be kept anonymous, told Business Insider that it's likely the new case has some connection to the the base, given the proximity.
But Matyas said no such link has been found and added that workers on the base were ""scary meticulous"" about safety.
""This individual has no connection whatsoever to that federal mission and to any of the personnel that have been involved in that evacuation process,"" he said.

The patient was not tested for COVID-19 at VacaValley during her four days there. After her symptoms worsened, she was transferred to the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Sacramento on February 19. But she wasn't tested there either until four days later.
""Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process,"" the center said in a statement.
Until now, the CDC has made decisions about whether to test people for the coronavirus based on whether they have recently traveled to places with outbreaks. 
But this case, Adalja said, shows that ""when we have protocols set up to really identify patients only based on travel history, those are going to fall short of identifying all cases.""
Matyas said testing criteria are indeed changing now, and the CDC praised the doctors who diagnosed the woman in a statement on Thursday.
""This case was detected through the US public health system — picked up by astute clinicians,"" the CDC said.
Dozens of healthcare workers were exposed

Health officials are working to trace and isolate anyone the patient had contact with — her family has been quarantined, and hospital staff are being evaluated and tested.
Aimee Brewer, president of NorthBay Healthcare, said any medical workers who had direct contact with the patient at VacaValley have been tested for the virus and are now on paid leave at home. So far, there have been no more positive tests, she said.
""As far as the headcount is concerned, at this time I can say it's a moving target,"" Steve Huddleston, vice president of public affairs at NorthBay Healthcare, said in a press conference Thursday. ""We have identified dozens of employees on our health team, but it still remains less than 100.""
According to CNN, a University of California, Davis student is also under investigation, and the student's two roommates are being isolated at their home off campus as well.
The CDC said in a statement on Thursday that ""unprecedented, aggressive efforts have been taken to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of this virus.""
A question of when, not if
A day before this case of community spread was reported, CDC officials suggested it was imminent.
""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said during a media briefing.
But thus far, the US lags behind other countries in testing — as of Wednesday, only 445 Americans had been tested for the virus.

""At first, CDC was the only place where testing could be performed,"" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, previously told Business Insider. ""For a country of our size, when you only have a single site doing that, it limits the resources available for testing.""
The CDC sent test kits nationwide earlier this month, but those were also found to be flawed, so only about a dozen labs can currently run the tests, according to The Washington Post.
'The cat's out of the bag in terms of it having spread'
Solano County and the nearby San Francisco and Santa Clara counties have all declared emergencies.
Matyas said the declaration frees up resources to ""allow us to investigate this incident more effectively and more efficiently.""
But he added that containment is ""only possible when you're dealing with a disease condition where you know everyone who's sick, and they get sick before they spread, and you can contain them — and that's a rare reality.""
Manuel Silvestri/Reuters
Now, he said, efforts must focus on mitigation because ""we know the cat's out of the bag in terms of it having spread, and what we're trying to do is slow the spread as much as possible.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday that 33 people in the state have tested positive for the virus — including citizens repatriated to military bases — and 8,400 people are being monitored. He stressed that the risk to the public is still low, but added that the state needs access to more resources. 
""We have just a few hundred testing kit,s and that's surveillance testing as well as diagnostic testing. That's simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head on,"" Newsom said."

But as the coronavirus outbreak grew, Peng postponed his wedding to help treat patients in Wuhan. He died of the disease on February 21.
Peng was one of at least eight healthcare workers who have died of the virus. Another young doctor, Li Wenliang, died February 7, leaving behind a son and pregnant wife. Li, who was 34, had been censored after sounding the alarm about the coronavirus to fellow medical-school alumni. 
As of Tuesday, more than 3,300 healthcare workers in China had been infected with the coronavirus, the LA Times reported. About 90% of those cases are in the Hubei province, where the outbreak began two months ago.
The deaths of doctors in their 20s and 30s naturally sparks concern about the coronavirus' risk to younger people, but according to China's National Health Commission, about 80% of people who have died from COVID-19 were over the age of 60.
Rather, the doctors' deaths highlight an unfortunate reality of any new and evolving outbreak: Healthcare workers on the front lines face a higher risk of contracting the disease.

Why healthcare workers are especially at risk 
Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 for a handful of reasons. First, the coronavirus is highly contagious, and medical staff members are exposed to more viral particles than the general public because they interact with so many sick people.
Research published earlier this month found that of 138 patients studied at one Wuhan hospital, 29% were healthcare workers. One coronavirus patient was initially sent to the wrong because they displayed atypical symptoms, so went on to infect at least 10 medical workers.
Second, healthcare workers in China have dealt with a shortage of supplies like masks, suits, and protective gear. That makes staff even more susceptible to the virus while treating patients.
Third, China's medical staff is overworked. At the end of January, the Washington Post reported that hospital staff in Wuhan were wearing adult diapers because they didn't have time to use the bathroom in between treating coronavirus patients. 
China has less than two physicians for every 10,000 residents, according to the WHO. 
When medical staff get sick, these problems compound.
""Just a very rough estimate, 100 nurses and doctors can look after 100 ordinary beds and 16 ICU beds,"" a Chinese hospital doctor — who was kept anonymous due to fears about losing his job — told the South China Morning Post earlier this month. ""If they are sick, not only do they occupy 100 beds, but the staff taking care of 100 beds are gone. That means a hospital loses the capacity of 200 beds. That is why the authorities have to keep sending medics over to Wuhan, not only because there are not enough beds, but because of a lack of health doctors and nurses to take care of the sick beds.""
Healthcare workers were disproportionately affected in other outbreaks, too

In past epidemics, healthcare workers were also disproportionately impacted by the illnesses they were treating.
The Ebola virus killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare workers were between 21 and 32 times more likely to be infected with Ebola than people in the general adult population. The risk of acquiring Ebola was 100 times higher for healthcare workers in Sierra Leone than the general population, a 2014 study revealed.
Around 20% of people who got SARS during that outbreak in 2002 and 2003 were medical workers. One highly contagious patient — a ""super-spreader"" — infected 50 healthcare workers.
Older people face the highest risk
The coronavirus has killed almost 2,900 people and infected more than 83,000 since December. The vast majority of cases and deaths, about 95%, have been in China, though ases have been reported in at least 56 other countries. (Read Business Insider's latest updates here.)
So far, research suggests older people with pre-existing health conditions are most likely to die.

About 80% of people who died in China were older than 60, and 75% had other medical issues, according to a recent report from China's National Health Commission. A study of 17 patients who died from coronavirus complications reported that their median age was around 75. Many had health problems like high blood pressure and Parkinson's disease.
Other studies have estimated the average ages of infected patients to be between 47 and 55. The largest coronavirus study to date, which examined 72,000 cases in China, revealed that more than 75% of infected patients were between 30 and 69.

A person in Washington state died after contracting the novel coronavirus, health authorities announced on Saturday. It is the first death attributed to the virus in the U.S.
We are dealing with an emergency evolving situation, Amy Reynolds, of the Washington state health department, told the Associated Press. A spokesperson for EvergreenHealth Medical Center in King County, Washington confirmed to the AP that the patient died there, but gave no other details.
It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. 
We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.

It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends, Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, said in a statement. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.
The news of the death comes one day after three new cases of coronavirus with unknown origin were reported in the United States. Before this week, the only confirmed cases of the virus in the country originated after a person traveled to an area of the world hard-hit by the disease, or developed after a person had close contact with a confirmed case. Cases with unknown origins are alarming to health authorities because their presence indicates that the disease is likely circulating within the population. 
The virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has spread to 57 countries around the world since it emerged in China in December. The respiratory disease has infected more than 85,000 people and killed more than 2,900. In the United States, 66 people with COVID-19 have been identified.
The healthcare industry is bracing for the virus. In California, 124 nurses and other healthcare workers at UC Davis Hospital, have been told to quarantine themselves at home, a healthcare union said on Friday. They are believed to have been exposed to the virus at the hospital where one coronavirus patient sought treatment.

Attempts to contain and mitigate the spread of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 are wreaking havoc on travel plans around the globe, and the annual Game Developers Conference is no exception. The majority of major sponsors for GDC 2020 in San Francisco have already pulled out a little more than two weeks ahead of the event's scheduled March 16 start. As of publication time, however, the event is still on, which raises the question: what would it take to make the GDC cancel?
On February 28 (Friday), GDC posted an update saying, ""We are closely monitoring the COVID19 (coronavirus) situation and want to assure everyone that your health and safety are a top priority. If our assessment of the situation changes, based on new and evolving developments or updated information, we will promptly update this statement regarding the status of GDC 2020 accordingly."" 
Sony and Facebook both backed out on February 20, the first of the dominoes to fall. Since then, other cancellations have followed rapidly. EA and Kojima Productions both backed out on February 24, then Unity, Microsoft, Epic Games (and Unreal Engine) bowed out on February 27, with Amazon and Activision/Blizzard following on February 28.
Most of those companies are not only major presenters and presences at the conference, they're also major sponsors. While the companies that have backed out represent only a small fraction of the total planned exhibitors, they occupy an outsize amount of space at the showextremely literally. A map of the show floor, where the scheduled booth space of companies that have cancelled is blacked out, looks dire:

GDC is not the first event to have to make the go/no-go call in the face of COVID-19, and it will not be the last. The world's biggest telecom show, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Spain, was cancelled earlier this month after vendors backed out. The Geneva Motor Show was also cancelled after Switzerland put a temporary ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Nor are smaller gatherings immune: The Eve Online fanfest, scheduled for April in Reykjavik, has also been cancelled, as has Facebook's own F8 developer conference, which would have started May 5."

With the dizzying international spread of the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization Friday announced that the global threat of COVID-19 has increased. The risk of spread and risk of impact has now risen from high to very high on a global scale, according to the organizations latest assessments.
Between Thursday and Friday, five additional countries identified their first casesBelarus, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Nigeriaand large outbreaks in Italy (888 cases) and Iran (388 cases) continue to export cases. So far, at least 24 cases in 14 countries link back to Italy and at least 97 cases in 11 countries link back to Iran, WHO reported Friday.
Worldwide, there are more than 85,400 cases and 2,924 deaths, with 53 countries reporting cases in addition to China, as of Saturday morning. While China still has over 90 percent of those cases, the daily case counts outside of China are now exceeding those within.
On Friday, China reported 331 new cases, while there were 1,027 cases reported elsewhere, according the WHOs latest situation report. The largest outbreak outside of China is currently in South Korea, which has reported 3,150 cases. Italy has the second-largest cluster of cases, followed by the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess, which has now reached 705 cases.
The continued spread and rising case counts outside China are clearly of concern, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday in a media briefing.
Wake up
Yet, while that spread ratchets up risk, he and his fellow experts at WHO also saw reason to be hopeful: most of the cases cropping up in new places can be clearly linked back to known contacts and clusters of casessuch as those from Italy and Iran.
We do not see evidence as yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities, the director-general, who goes by Dr. Tedros, said Friday. As long as thats the case, we still have a chance of containing this virusif robust action is taken to detect cases early, isolate and care for patients, and trace contacts.
And theres clear evidence that containment can work. In addition to Chinas dramatic decline in cases over this month, eight countries with identified cases have gone two weeks without reporting new cases, Dr. Tedros said. And, as of the time of publication Saturday, 15 of the 53 countries with cases were reporting only one new case. Another 19 countries with cases tallied 10 or fewer.
Moreover, Dr. Tedros made a point of putting the global cases in perspective: there are 6,000 or so cases among the more than 6 billion people outside of China.
This virus is serious and dangerous, but it can be contained, Dr. Tedros emphasized.
In fact, the move to increase the threat level should get that very point across, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, said in the briefing.
This is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up. Get ready. This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready. You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world, to be ready, and I think thats what this alert says. It says we can avoid the worst of this, but our level of concern is at its highest.
Not ready
Such readiness to avoid the worst has, unfortunately, not been on display in the United States, so far.
As of Saturday morning, the United States has reported four COVID-19 cases that may represent instances of community spread. That is, the four people may have picked up the infection from people in their own community as the virus spread undetected through the general public. In all four cases, the infected people had no known exposure through travel and had no contact with a person known to be infected.
Its an alarming sign that the USdespite its prominence on the world stage and the time it has had to prepareis failing to detect and contain the virus.
Among the four cases, two are in California, one is in Oregon, and another is in Washington state. Three of the cases (excluding one in California) are considered presumptive for now, meaning that health authorities in the individual states have tested the patients and found them positive, but final confirmation from CDC testing is pending.
The cases, if all are confirmed, bring the countrys tally to at least 66. Of those, 44 are in passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess, and three are in people repatriated from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began in December.
Thirteen cases appear to be travel-related, and two additional cases were contracted from person-to-person spread in the US from a known travel-related case.
The four remaining cases were possibly community spread. One of those casesa California woman who lives in Solano Countywas announced earlier this week. The news cycle was still reeling from it when, late on Friday, news broke of the other three cases.
Testing, testing
The Solano County womans case is particularly worrying because it highlights several weaknesses in the countrys COVID-19 preparedness. The woman reportedly checked into a local hospital with flu-like symptoms February 15. The patient was initially suspected of having COVID-19. But the woman wasnt tested until February 25, largely due to a low availability of testing and federal recommendations that testing focus on people with known exposures (and she had no known exposure). Between that time, her condition deteriorated, and she was intubated and put on a ventilator.
The first clear weakness is the low availability of testing, which has mainly been done in labs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has sent testing kits to states, but some states reported problems with their kits. The CDC has been trying to work out an unspecified glitch in the kits, but the process has been slow. So far, the CDC has reported testing 459 people, which is just a fraction of the number of people that have been tested in other countries.
This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a press briefing Friday. She reported that the CDC has come up with a workaround that will allow states to increase testing.
Increased testing capacity is critical for identifying new cases and preventing further spread of the virus within the US, particularly with the possibility of community spreadand the community in which the first case was identified points to another weakness.
Suspicious spread
The first case of potential community spread occurred in Solano County, California, which just happens to be were hundreds of repatriated citizensat high risk of carrying the virushave been quarantined. Repatriated citizens began arriving at Travis Air Force Base, located in Solano, at the beginning of February, a week or two before the woman developed symptoms. The potential community spread near where high-risk groups of people have been housed raises the possibility that the quarantine failed.
That concern was reinforced by news of a whistleblower allegation that the Department of Health and Human Services sent untrained personnel without proper protective gear to handle those high-risk repatriated citizens. If true, HHS put employees at risk of contracting the virus and then spreading it to their families and communities.
According to the whistleblowers complaint, 13 unprepared employees were sent to Travis Air Force Base in Solano between February 2 and February 7, when planes loaded with repatriated citizens were arriving. The complaint alleges the employees were not tested for coronavirus afterward and returned to their normal offices and duties, with some taking commercial flights back to their stations in various, unspecified parts of the country.
The CDC did not respond to questions from Ars regarding the potential that the quarantine at Travis Air Force Base closed.
The three other, potentially community-spread cases appear to be unconnected to the Solano woman, according to The Washington Post. One case is in a 65-year-old woman from Santa Clara County, California. The case in Oregon was in a person from Washington County who had spent time in an elementary school near Portland. That school has now been closed for cleaning. The case in Washington state is in a high school student from Snohomish County, just north of Seattle. That students school has also been closed, and students with known contact are being isolated at home for 14 days.
The cases are an alarming sign that the US has failed its duty to be ready and has already lost control of the virus.
Communication breakdown
Last, reports this week raised concern of yet another weakness in the countrys preparednessthat information about the virus and the situation in the United States may be being censored by the Trump administration. According to a report Friday in The New York Times, all statements and appearances from federal officials regarding the coronavirusincluding, it seems, those from CDC officialsmust now be filtered through the office of Vice President Mike Pence, who President Trump appointed Wednesday to lead the coronavirus response.
The move has reportedly buttoned up leading experts, notably Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the countrys foremost experts on viruses and infectious disease and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. According to the Times, Dr. Fauci has told colleagues that the White House instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.
Likewise, in the CDCs briefing Friday, Dr. Messonniers comments sounded more carefully vetted than normal and included a conspicuous reference to President Trump. It marked the first time the CDC had referenced the president in a briefing on COVID-19 cases, according to transcripts of the briefings.
As always, President Trumps and our number-one priority is the health and safety of the American people, Dr. Messonnier said in her opening remarks Friday.
The CDC declined to a request to comment from Ars on the reported censorship.
According to CDCs archive of transcripts, Dr. Messonnier had only mentioned the word trump on one other occasion, on February 3, when she said, And certainly, what Ive seen in situations like this, science should trump everything else."

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
 (CNN)How bad will it get? That was the question this week, but it applied to several things: the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus around the world, the resulting stock market plunge and the concern about whether America's political leaders are up to the challenge.
An outbreak of the disease is inevitable in the US, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tuesday: ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but ... a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."" 
Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner, wrote that the disease ""will test our government's response and resiliency. How we weather the outbreak also hinges on our trust that the government has our best intentions at heart."" She added that, ""we don't yet know if the trajectory of COVID-19 will be mild, moderate, or severe"" but it makes sense to prepare for the worst case. 
Wall Street apparently agreed, with the Dow plunging 3,583 points, making it by percentage terms the worst week since October, 2008. In the Perspectives section of CNN Business, Paul LaMonica recalled covering that financial crisis. ""That was a terrifying time but this seems a lot scarier,"" he wrote. ""Yes, the Fed can do lots of things to help soothe frayed nerves when stocks are in free fall, but there is little that the Fed or President Trump and Congress, for that matter can do to solve this biological crisis for the markets and the economy.""
""Even if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That's because China has become a global economic powerhouse."" And by now the virus has gone well beyond the borders of China.
""The best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts -- not to the President. He's not telling the truth. He's gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts,"" Ghitis wrote. She noted, ""It's not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump's 'black swan,' the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection.""
In the Washington Post, David Ignatius wrote that, ""one of President Trump's failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors...Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner's suggestion that the CDC was 'exaggerating' the threat."" Taking it further, at a South Carolina rally Friday, Trump said, ""the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus"" in what he called ""their new hoax.""
Presidents are called upon to reassure the nation in the wake of traumatic events, wrote Joe Lockhart -- Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn after the 9/11 attacks. So far, Trump is failing that leadership test, Lockhart said. ""He has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home.""
Chelsea Clinton and the co-author of her book on global health, Devi Sridhar, noted that, ""President Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress."" 
Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the effort to combat the virus. ""It's hard to imagine a worse choice for a job that requires respect for public health,"" wrote Pence biographer Michael D'Antonio. ""In addition to his climate-change skepticism...he is known for penning, when he was running for Congress, what could be generously termed a nutty article that said, 'despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill.'"" 
As we wait to see the extent of the virus outbreak, here's some useful advice from Dr. Colleen Kraft, the associate medical director of Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: ""Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers.""
The Democratic primary is at a critical moment. Joe Biden scored a decisive victory Saturday in South Carolina, but will he have the momentum to unseat Bernie Sanders as the Democrats' frontrunner? 
""Moderate voters may well snap back into the Biden camp,"" wrote Jeff Yang, ""and other centrist candidates may feel the pressure to make an increasingly hard decision: Whether to stay in the race and continue to fragment the vote against Sanders or bow out and lend support to Biden."" 
On Super Tuesday, March 3, roughly a third of the delegates will be chosen and the race could be decided within weeks -- or remain hotly contested until the Democrats meet for their convention in Milwaukee in July.
Elliot Williams summed up the moderates' feeling: Sanders ""struggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). He all but ensures that his Republican opponent will make the election a referendum on socialism...Attack ads from President Donald Trump and his allies assailing Sanders' views on Fidel Castro and Soviet Russia practically write themselves. And don't get me started about the conduct of some of his supporters and even some of his staffers online."" 
""Take a deep breath"" anyway, Williams added. ""Bernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump -- maybe even a better one."" 
When Sanders praised some aspects of dictator Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, critics called it an unforced error and said it would hurt him badly with Cuban-American emigres in Florida. Rebecca Bodenheimer agreed that it was ""ill-advised"" but argued that it wasn't wrong: ""Both the things he said were true: the Castro regime (and the successive iterations of it under Raúl Castro and now Miguel Díaz-Canel) was and is authoritarian...And, early on in the 1960s, Castro initiated a grassroots program that resulted in a massive increase in literacy in Cuba, as well as building a strong universal healthcare and educational system.""
Sanders is stirring excitement around the country, Dean Obeidallah noted: ""Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000. Two weeks ago, the night before the New Hampshire primary, Sanders packed more than 7,500 into an arena, with USA Today noting that this 'event easily marked the largest in the Democratic contest in New Hampshire.'""
The Vermont senator could win it all, wrote John Avlon, but he has a hill to climb because he's out of sync with much of the country ideologically. ""Bernie Sanders has built a movement and he has momentum. But there are plenty of rational reasons to think that nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk -- and could deliver Donald Trump a second term."" 
A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent contemplated the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race with real dread. ""Both represent two sides of the same coin,"" Dent wrote. ""They both appeal to anger. They scream that the system is rigged, you're a victim, and that they can give you your country back if only you follow them."" 
Millions of voters are in the middle, between the left and the right, he said. They ""want a candidate who believes in capitalism, reasonably regulated market-based solutions to problems, social tolerance and acceptance, and constructive international engagement...Most of all they'll want someone who conducts himself or herself in a thoughtful, deliberate and measured way. They want stability, not chaos and recklessness."" 
A food fight in South Carolina
The Democrats' South Carolina debate was fierce, with the moderators letting candidates talk over each other. It ""was somewhere between an episode of 'The Jerry Springer Show' and a 'Real Housewives' reunion: messy, chaotic and embarrassing for nearly everyone involved,"" wrote Raul Reyes. 
""It was inevitable that, as the stakes have grown higher in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, there would be a greater sense of urgency among the candidates to stand out. But that did not mean the event had to devolve into a free-for-all."" 
""Moderates across the country exhaled a collective sigh of relief after Tuesday's debate,"" wrote Tara Setmayer. ""Joe Biden is back. It was clear the former Vice President was much more comfortable and cogent on the debate stage this time around in South Carolina.""
Elizabeth Warren picked up where she left off at the Nevada debate, with blistering attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg. But the former New York mayor seemed much more prepared this time. ""Mayor Michael Bloomberg fought his way back into contention in the Democratic primary for president by obeying a simple rule: never let an attack go unanswered,"" wrote Errol Louis.
The sheer force of Bloomberg's money cascade is keeping him a major factor in the election. He could wind up spending billions on advertising in pursuit of the presidency, wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, who argued that whatever its political impact, it is a financially savvy move. 
""As an aging billionaire many times over, Mayor Bloomberg sees the clock ticking."" Bloomberg's fortune has been estimated at more than $60 billion. Whatever he doesn't spend or give away will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax.
So if he spends $5 billion to get to the White House, the US Treasury will ultimately lose out on $2 billion in taxes, McCaffery pointed out.
""This is in no way a condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg, who has presumably earned his money legally, and can spend it however he wants, again perfectly legally... It is, rather, a condemnation of a tax system that both allows some billionaires to amass wealth and to spend it, tax free and with no questions asked."" 
After the Harvey Weinstein verdict
The onetime Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault and rape charges that could send him to prison for a minimum of five years. It was a win for the #MeToo movement, wrote Caroline Polisi. 
The ""verdict will encourage more victims of sexual assault to come forward and report their abuse, with the knowledge that although the road to justice will not be easy, it will at least be a possibility. And that is so much more than they ever had before."" 
Two things have to happen now, wrote Kara Alaimo. There needs to be more visibility about non-disclosure agreements that have been used to bury allegations against powerful abusers, she said.
""Second, lawmakers need to help victims learn their rights and avenues for redress -- especially those who are most disenfranchised.

Wazhma Frogh is nearly 40 but she can't forget the raid on her Kabul public school when she was in fifth grade.
""I still remember the exact words of those bearded men, Kalashnikovs on their shoulders, batons in their hand -- as they yelled, 'Get out of here. Girls don't belong in schools!' I can even remember the cries of several of our teachers, who were wearing skirts and were beaten in their legs, as the Mujahedeen shouted that their skirt wearing days were over.""
It was the start of a civil war that closed down the schools. Frogh, now the leader of the Women and Peace Studies organization in Kabul, wrote that she ""never saw my classmates or my teachers ever again.""
She argued that, as the US embarks on a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, it's vital that the experience of the early 1990s -- ""when civil war and extremist forces came to dominate our politics and our lives"" -- not be repeated. 
Peter Bergen wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. ""For the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and he could just as easily pull the plug entirely."" The agreement calls for a full withdrawal over a 14-month period but officials say that is dependent on what the Taliban does.
Katharine Johnson, an American hero
Katharine Johnson was so central to NASA's exploration of space that, as Reshma Saujani wrote, ""Astronaut John Glenn famously asked Katherine to personally recheck the calculations made by electronic computers before his Friendship 7 mission to space. 'If she says they're good,' he said, 'then I'm ready to go.'"" On that mission in 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.
Johnson, who died this week at 101, lived to see her story told in the Oscar-nominated film ""Hidden Figures."" She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson. ""In a world that all too often tells girls -- especially black girls -- that they don't belong in STEM, Katherine Johnson was exactly the icon our girls needed,"" wrote Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit.
""Katherine was the epitome of bravery. When she was told that women didn't participate in the briefings at NASA; she asked whether there was a law against it. There wasn't. So Katherine started attending briefings. She asked questions. She, bravely, put herself in the rooms where she knew she deserved to be."""

After speaking with medical professionals, he believes that the issue isn’t COVID-19, but “organ failure through chronic hypoxia.” Essentially, a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream means that people’s bodies slowly suffocate to death over a period of days. 
The issue is often compounded by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), inflammation of the lungs, which makes breathing difficult. “Their lungs are compromised to the extent that, even with a ventilator on pure oxygen breathing for them, it’s impossible to get enough oxygen.” Reynolds believes that the solution isn’t more ventilation but to make breathing easier for patients in respiratory distress. And for a person with expertise in diving and diving equipment, the obvious answer is a hyperbaric chamber.
Hyperbaric chambers work by increasing the pressure outside the body, and they’re commonly used to treat breathing-related conditions. First, the lungs work less to breathe because the air pressure is so much greater that air forces itself in. Second, at higher pressures, oxygen is more soluble, so every breath gets more oxygen into the bloodstream. And higher levels of blood oxygenation, according to the Mayo Clinic, can “promote healing and fight infection.”
“Hyperbaric oxygen [therapy] is known to reduce inflammation,” said Dr. Reynolds, which could mitigate the effects of ARDS, too. Unfortunately, hyperbaric chambers are not common and are only used in very specific medical and diving-related scenarios. “There are not anywhere near enough hyperbaric chambers to cope with thousands of patients,” said Dr. Reynolds. Since it’s impractical to quickly mass-produce these chambers, Reynolds and his team started looking for alternatives.
Enter the grounded aircraft.
When a plane is in flight, it reaches heights where the air is very thin, and the air pressure is far weaker than at sea level. That means it’s doubly hard for a person to breathe at altitude, so planes are pressurized to near sea-level. Since planes aren’t in use, can already adjust their internal pressure and have oxygen routing capabilities, it’s plausible that they’d do the job. 
Reynolds suggests having a series of beds inside the cabin, with medical professionals in attendance, just like a normal ward. There would be a 90-minute cycle in which the cabin pressure would be increased to between 1.6 and 2 atmospheres. During this time, each patient would be breathing high-pressure oxygen through a mask in the hope of improving their condition. At the end of each 90-minute cycle, the plane would be depressurized and staff and equipment could move in and out as required.
Dr. Gerado Bosco is a professor at the University of Padua, specializing in hyperbaric therapy and biomechanics. He is one of a handful of researchers waiting for approval to begin testing hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. In trials, his team would expose patients to different pressures in 90-minute cycles and examine their response. The hope is that patients find it easier to breathe, their ARDS is mitigated and their immune response improves. 
He says that the plan to use grounded aircraft as hyperbaric treatment centers is “intriguing,” but that it’s far too early to comment. He does believe that, if the treatment is successful in trials, it may lead to a “tremendous decrease in ventilatory response.” 
The International Hyperbarics Association has published information relating to a study from Wuhan, China. According to the report, which we have not yet been able to confirm, Dr. Zhong Yangling, treated five COVID-19 patients, two in critical condition, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. All of them showed signs of hypoxia before the course started, and all five are said to have improved after the first two sessions. 
A study is being prepared in the US, and Dr. Bosco’s Italian study is working in partnership with a Canadian trial led by Dr. Rita Katznelson at Toronto General Hospital. The latter has started a JustGiving page to get funding for the trial -- and hopes to raise $250,000 (USD). 
As for the planes themselves, Technion University Aerospace researcher Neta Blum says it is possible to pressurize a cabin to up to 2.5atm if boosted by the pressure at sea level. She mentioned the one issue may be that repeated cycles of pressurizing and depressurizing the cabin could cause “fatigue cracks” in the plane’s fuselage. That may deter airlines from loaning their craft to the effort, especially if it renders them unusable in future. 
But nothing can, or should, be done until the science -- which, at present, is pretty flimsy -- is properly tested. If those studies show promise, however, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may prove to be a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19."

The country has ditched its centralized approach to COVID-19 tracking, based on Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), in favor of a “decentralized architecture” that only stores contact data on devices. this more closely resembles the approach Apple and Google will take when their beta tracing tools arrive in the next few days. It’s not clear when Germany’s app will be ready.
Contact tracing apps like COVIDSafe could prove vital to ending lockdowns by making it easier to track the spread (and hopefully, decline) of the virus as public life resumes. Rather than shutting down most of society, officials could limit closures and stay-home orders to specific businesses and people. The challenge is getting enough adoption for the apps to be effective. Australia, for instance, wants at least 40 percent of the population to enlist. That’s a massive amount for any app, and privacy reassurances might be crucial for reaching that target."

Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images
To get myself through the pandemic, Ive been summoning everything Ive learned about surviving in a new world as an immigrant. I left the Philippines as a kid to join my parents in California. Walang tiyaga, walang nilaga, my grandma used to say. Strictly translated, it means no perseverance, no stew. That lesson on weathering hardship recently took on new meaning.
Im not just worried about the virus. Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans are up, while President Trump continues to characterize the disease as foreign and Chinese. Some of my friends are worried about heading outside not only because of the virus, but because of the racist slurs hurled at them. 
Went to take out trash.Was talking on phone in Chinese. Man walked by on sidewalk &amp; in interest of social distancing,I said,""sorry, go ahead."" ""FUCKING CHINESE,""he yelled loud enough I could hear him over aide's voice on phone. I turned to look at him to make sure I heard right

Filipinos, like other immigrant groups, tend to be overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic. The Philippines sends more nurses abroad to staff the worlds health care systems than any other country in the world. Filipinos also make up a third of all cruise ship workers and, in China, are the largest group of migrant domestic workers. The service industry that delivers food to our doorsteps relies on immigrants, too. 
immigrants are overrepresented in jobs on the front lines of the pandemic
Many of the neighborhoods where people of color and immigrants live have more air pollution, which can be deadly during outbreaks of a virus that affects the lungs. For instance, Latinos are over 51 percent more likely to live in counties with dangerous levels of smog than non-Hispanic whites. That can lead to chronic conditions such as asthma that make someone especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Pollution has also been linked to heart disease; people with serious heart conditions are also at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.
Theres more. Some immigrants are afraid to seek care because they are worried that they will endanger their own immigration status by doing so. Under a new rule, a person who uses public benefits like Medicaid can be denied a green card. This doesnt apply to permanent residents renewing their green cards, but misinformation is already stopping people from getting care. After pushback from Democrats, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it wouldnt penalize green card applicants for getting treatment or testing for COVID-19. ICE announced on the 18th that it wont carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities; advocates and doctors worried that the fear of getting swept up by ICE might keep people from getting care. But that might not matter if people are too afraid to see a doctor. 
With any disaster, some people are hit first and worst. There are parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental injustice, says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who led the EPAs efforts to address environmental racism and injustice under the Obama administration. In both crises, the people facing the greatest risk are often people of color, working class families, and the poor. More of our folks are going to die disproportionately, he says, meaning black, brown, and indigenous communities. The people calling the shots dont come from the places that are most affected so they often dont understand whats happening on the ground. They might even make decisions that make things worse.
More of our folks are going to die disproportionately
Now, the Trump administration is using the pandemic as an excuse to push hard-line immigration policies it would have pursued anyway, says Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. [Theyre] really taking advantage of this moment, even though its a questionable decision to pour resources into that, she says. Maybe we shouldnt be concentrating more on finding masks for doctors and nurses than we should be on kicking asylum seekers out of the country. 
Pierce thinks more people will lose their work authorization or violate their visas because US Citizenship and Immigration Services has shut down its offices and suspended in-person meetings that immigrants must attend to keep their legal status. That means more people could face deportation or detention in facilities that, like prisons, can become hotbeds for disease. While immigrant rights advocates are calling for detention centers to shut down, the Trump administration is using them to fearmonger. 
People in detention could pass the virus on to customs and border patrol officers, and even the United States population as a whole, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a March 20th briefing on the pandemic. Migrants in [detention] facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic, he added. That day, the administration announced it would begin to remove anyone crossing US borders illegally, including people seeking asylum, immediately without due process. 
Ive heard this crap my whole life: that immigrants take more than we give whether thats overburdening health care, snatching jobs, or whatever so lets send them away. Racism and xenophobia has always threatened my existence in this country. 
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics
That us versus them flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics. Italian immigrants were scapegoats for the New York City polio epidemics in 1907 and 1916. Cholera was called Asiatic cholera in the 1800s and tuberculosis called the Jewish disease in the 1900s. Thousands of people died from AIDS before the Reagan administration began taking the epidemic seriously in the mid 1980s, after making callous jokes about the disease referred to as gay plague. 
With this new virus, something was triggered that is always latently there, under the surface, which is this fear of the other and the idea that bad things come from elsewhere, York University professor Roger Keil told The Verge in February. 
The virus is already spreading in the US; its useless to scapegoat migrants at our borders when we now have more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world. The Latin American country with the most cases of COVID-19 is Brazil, which had 2,433 cases on the 26th just over a tenth of the number of infections in New York City alone. It seems likelier that migrants in detention centers will get sick here. And deporting people who were infected in the US back to other countries means spreading the disease further. 
Shifting blame onto others does nothing to keep Americans, including myself, safe. Its a waste of energy when every moment matters in our response to the crisis. Ive watched New York Citys local officials plead daily for ventilators and federal assistance. As someone who calls this place home, this is terrifying. My mom and many of my aunties are nurses in the US; they need more masks and medical supplies to keep people healthy. 
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder
Division only makes dealing with disaster harder, both Ali and Pierce told me. Another lesson Ive learned from my community is that the only way we beat the odds is when we show up for each other. My aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandmothers stepped in to take care of me in the Philippines until my parents were on solid footing and could send for me. Together, they got me here to where I am today. The only way to get through this crisis will be to do so together, too. My mom and aunties will take care of you when you get sick. Make sure to take care of them, too. Theyre immigrants, and well need them.

Grindr is at least up-front about the topic; even still, the hookup app has no info on the erotic quandaries of quarantine.
Tinder, for its part, has acknowledged the coronavirus. But rather than actually talk about hookups and viral loads, the dating app avoided the specific reason why it would say anything in the first place. ""While we want you to continue to have fun,"" its glib pop-up stated, ""protecting yourself from the Coronavirus is more important."" This was followed by a four-point ""wash your hands"" shortlist and a link to the World Health Organization.
Grindr serves 5 million users worldwide; Bumble has 22 million. Tinder counts 50 million members globally. Since sex and dating is a contact sport, you'd think that being able to tell 77 million people specific ways not to die while using their dating apps would be of the utmost urgency. Think about it: they have a unique chance to talk about what's really going on with quarantine quandaries and tech-enabled hookups.
But ew, sex. It's like they either forgot that dating's raison d'être is intimacy — or they're shoveling a bullshit pretense that their apps have nothing to do with sex.
Dating and hookup app users have adapted to COVID-19, even if prudish tech companies haven't. There's a surge in bios now looking for quarantine amor; cuddle pals and shut-in lovers, to ""ride it out,"" if you will. It's enough to make the ""wash your hands"" pop-ups look criminally negligent. Buzzfeed reported Tinder users saying they weren't that concerned about catching coronavirus, with one male saying he has ""no intention of letting it dictate my social life.""
I'll bet those 77 million people desperately want to know how ""social distancing"" applies to hand-holding. Or how to know if (or when) it's safe to kiss someone. Tinder's ""distancing"" caution specified ""public gatherings,"" but what about private gatherings?
That's tens of millions actively wondering right now: is novel coronavirus similar to other STDs? Like, even if you wore sexy rubber catsuits and kept your bits covered in latex, can anyone bang safely right now? Is this the AIDS epidemic all over again, where the desire for sex is reviled like having a death wish? What horrible future are we in now that all dating has become... teleconferencing?
More to the point, we have to wonder if coronavirus infections will spread because Big Tech is too scared to talk plainly and non-judgmentally about COVID-19, human desire, and sexual communication.
""If dating apps wanted to follow the protocols of the adult industry,"" explained Free Speech Coalition Communication Director Mike Stabile, ""they should realize that, in a public health crisis, they are a unique portal to the population and can be an effective way to communicate information.""
When the adult industry sees a potential risk to the performer pool, we shut down PASS — the performer testing system — to alert performers and producers that there is a production hold.
The adult industry has survived and thrived precisely because we do talk about sexual health and safety constantly. Society needs to learn to talk about sexual risk in a way that's not stigmatizing or accusatory, but as medical fact.
""Not everyone reads the news or is on social media,"" Stabile added. ""We all have our part to play.""
Can't swipe it away
Like everyone else, adult performers and other sex industry workers are concerned about coronavirus transmission risks. The Free Speech Coalition posted a porn-industry-specific COVID-19 advisory last week, describing new behaviors to adopt for coronavirus safety in a sexual atmosphere. ""In some ways, this is familiar territory for us,"" explained FSC's Stabile. ""Despite the intimate nature of our business, our sets are smaller and crew are already trained in safe handling of bodily fluids.""
If only the stewards of bazillion-dollar tech apps were as innovative and efficient as the sex industries they exclude and erase at every turn. ""The adult industry is used to talking about risk-mitigation, and already have an infrastructure set up with health and testing protocols,"" Stabile said, noting that all performers are notified en masse when there's a health risk to the population, and doesn't generalize about it in a quick pop-up linking to the WHO.
Bumble's upsell to its videoconference product, by comparison, was crass and a missed opportunity to say why safer coronavirus sex matters now more than ever. FSC told Engadget that ""some performers are already shifting toward more self-produced content, cams and solos."" And this is exactly how wider sex work communities are shifting as the business of sexual intimacy meets stark COVID-19 transmission concerns for both workers and their clients.
""On Tuesday,"" wrote an anonymous sex worker, ""politician Lord Bethell spoke in the House of Lords about the risk of transmitting coronavirus through kissing and other forms of social intercourse, saying: ""Kissing is wonderful but potentially dangerous."" As an in-person sex worker, this isn't good for business.""
Former full-service sex worker and author of the Thriving in Sex Work series Lola Davina told Engadget via email, ""Any time social distancing is the solution to a problem, contact sex workers, including strippers, masseuses/masseurs, professional dominants, and full service sex workers will be hit hard.""
Evolving faster than tech companies, online workers are stepping up to coach others to find new, non-contact ways to get the job(s) done. And while the Senate GOP blocked an emergency paid sick leave bill intended to deal with the fallout of coronavirus, the Sex Worker Aid Initiative of Seattle sprang into action and launched a ""COVID19 #MutualAid fund and emergency response for affected community members.""
Dating apps could learn a lot from sex workers about what to say to their 77 million scared and horny users -- all of whom are at risk now. Writer and performer Lorelei Lee offers cleaning details revealing that a BDSM dungeon is probably one of the lowest-risk locations you could find yourself in a pandemic. New York based escort fera lorde spelled it all out in an informative Twitter thread. ""We already use (sometimes medical grade) sanitation products for laundry, surfaces, doorknobs, toys, hands – you name it. I've never worked in an incall that didn't have a plethora of sanitation products and antibacterial soap/hand sanitizer on hand and stocked up...""

— fera lorde (@feralorde) March 10, 2020
Needless to say, coronavirus safety advice to 77 million people using your app to hook up is quite different than advice for going to Trader Joe's and panic buying all the frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken. Especially when you consider that the pandemic and quarantine is now projected to have a massive sexual impact on the general population.
A pandemic in your pants
This week, San Francisco AIDS Foundation posted a very detailed information page about steps to prevent novel coronavirus — far more on social distancing than Tinder's pop-up. UCSF posted really helpful notes from its expert panel on COVID-19, explicitly stating that routes of infection occur in three ways: ""Hand to mouth / face; Aerosol transmission; and, Fecal oral route.""
The Guttmacher Institute looked at the bigger picture, detailing expected outcomes of current response and our certain sexual doom in its COVID-19 outbreak post, Potential Fallout for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights.
""Unlike the Zika virus outbreak,"" Guttmacher wrote, ""where sexual and mother-to-infant transmission were well-established, much less is known today about these potential transmission routes for COVID-19."" That sounds to me like something every horny app user on Earth should know right now.
Further, Guttmacher detailed:
At the health system level, we may see shortages of medications—such as contraceptives, antiretrovirals for HIV/AIDS and antibiotics to treat STIs—due to disruptions in supply chains overall.
...health authorities have recommended that people stock up ... items like oral contraceptives, the contraceptive patch and ring, condoms, spermicide and lubrication will be important items on that list. However, building that stockpile might be difficult because of supply shortages and insurance practices that often limit reimbursement to just one month of prescription drugs at a time.
So while some joke on social media about all the COVID-19 babies we'll be seeing in December, everyone else who works in sexual health is deeply, terribly worried about a certain spike in STDs and STIs. It's one thing if dating and hookup apps could let everyone know that kissing, and yes, banging, is a way you can become a vector to accidentally infect your grandma with coronavirus. But it seems equally urgent for Big Tech to tell thirsty users that most condoms are made in China, there are predicted birth control pill shortages, as well as meds to deal with sexually transmitted infections and diseases.
Also, lots of unwanted pregnancies. And there's a chance diseases like HIV could become lethal once again as the availability and access to PreP and antivirals dry up.
Plus, while Trader Joe's was getting its shelves wiped clean in San Francisco this week, I noticed that Bed Bath and Beyond was seeing its shelves of condoms diminish -- and that was Thursday.
Thirsty for the truth
As a trained sex crisis counselor (and a training speaker for sex-ed peers), the ways in which dating and hookup apps are worsening the coronavirus by being sex-phobic bystanders makes me want to scream, or fill the interior of a Bumble executive's Tesla with inferior lube, or set Home Alone style dildo traps throughout Tinder's offices. Something, anything, to make them wake the hell up. Talking about coronavirus and sex isn't going to kill business, but not talking about it certainly will kill someone.
Ultimately, sex and the pandemic is all about harm reduction. Know the risks: Specifically, how transmission occurs, and how that fits into what you'd like to do. Make the best decision for your individual situation that reduces as many risks as possible for you, your sexytime partner(s), and the people you care about.
One way you might reduce your risks is by not taking any — like worldwide sex party club Kinky Salon. This week the club notified its happy-go-pervy patrons that in-person events were on hold indefinitely. ""Let's face it,"" they wrote in a mass email, ""no amount of hand washing will work when we're all making out with each other!""
It's okay if you don't want to deal; it's perfectly okay to put your sex life on hold until this intense storm passes. Just make sure your idea of 'not dealing with it' doesn't include ignoring your risks (and how you might put others at risk) if you decide to get down.
The discussions of sex, dating, tech, and COVID-19 will continue for a long time to come. It's up to us to make sure they keep happening — especially when hookup and dating apps act like keeping users informed and alive is simply ""not their department.""

To make more of the life saving devices, manufacturers are turning to new designs that are faster and more affordable to make -- and the super affordable Raspberry Pi computer boards have become a go-to component. Tom’s Hardware reports that The Raspberry Pi Foundation is ramping up production of its Pi Zero boards to help supply manufacturers with enough units to keep up with the high demand for ventilators. While the $5 Pi Zero is the company’s least powerful computer (it features a single core, 1.0 GHz CPU and 512 GB of RAM) it still has enough juice to control the relatively simple computing tasks of a ventilator.
Another reason Raspberry Pi boards are ideal for ventilators is the company’s ability to supply them quickly. Eben Upton, CEO and Founder of Raspberry Pi told Tom’s Hardwarethat, “Raspberry Pi ‘builds to stock’ rather than ‘building to order,’ so we generally have products either on-hand or in the pipeline with short lead times.” The company made 192,000 Pi Zero and Pi Zero W boards in the first quarter of 2020, but is aiming to produce 250,000 of them in the second quarter of the year. Upton said that, as far as he is aware, this is the first time Raspberry Pi boards are being used as medical device components."

It's available in rural areas, but patients needed to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Now, patients will be able to access telehealth at home and from anywhere in the country.
Patients and clinicians will need a two-way visual and voice connection, and standard copays and deductibles will apply. Though, healthcare providers may be able to waive or reduce cost-sharing for telehealth.
The risk of serious illness from the coronavirus is much higher for older people and those with underlying health conditions, so keeping those populations at home while still providing healthcare makes sense. Now, older patients with diabetes, for instance, won't have to postpone routine visits, and if a patient is concerned they may have the coronavirus disease, they can consult with their doctor via telehealth.
This policy change is made possible by a waiver of Medicare rules authorized by Congress, as well as emergency declarations made by the Trump administration. The expanded telehealth coverage will remain in effect during the outbreak, but this could be an important step toward making remote healthcare more widely available in the future."

Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Director, Earth System Branch in WMO’s Infrastructure Department believes that the impact of losing those aerial observations will still be “relatively modest.” However, he explained in a recent press release, “as the decrease in availability of aircraft weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts.”
“The same is true if the decrease in surface-based weather observations continues, in particular if the COVID-19 outbreak starts to more widely impact the ability of observers to do their job in large parts of the developing world. WMO will continue to monitor the situation, and the organization is working with its Members to mitigate the impact as much as possible,” he continued.
More immediate is the problem with the system’s aircraft-based sensors; primarily that they’re no longer in the sky, collecting vital ambient temperature, wind speed and direction readings. Aircraft rely on the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program (AMDAR) to collect the necessary data using onboard sensors, process and transmit it to relay stations on the ground via radio or satellite link. 
“More than 3,500 commercial aircraft normally provide over 250 million observations per year,” a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson told Engadget. “Throughout the flight path… these aircraft provide pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction, and in some cases humidity.”
The COVID-19 crisis has severely curtailed the commercial air travel industry. According to FlightRadar24, commercial traffic declined by 4.1 percent year-over-year in February followed by a 21.6 percent YOY drop in March. We could potentially see an overall 8.9 percent reduction of global air traffic compared to last year, according to one Bloomberg analyst. 
“As of March 31, the daily output of meteorological data from U.S. commercial aircraft has decreased to approximately half of normal levels,” the NOAA rep continued. They were also quick to point out that “even though a decrease in this critical data will possibly negatively impact forecast model skill, it does not necessarily translate into a reduction in forecast accuracy since National Weather Service meteorologists use an entire suite of observations and guidance to produce an actual forecast.”
However, a 2017 study conducted by NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory suggests that including aircraft-based data reduces six-hour forecast errors in wind, humidity and temperature by up to 30 percent in the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model for North America. As such, ""we would expect some decrease in skill at least in some specific situations from the [current] decline in aircraft data volume,"" Stanley Benjamin, the study’s co-author, told Weather.
A separate study conducted at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) found that eliminating aircraft data from their models reduced the accuracy of Northern Hemisphere jet-stream level forecasts by 15 percent and 3 percent for surface pressure. What’s more, as of February, the National Weather Service reports that it is only incorporating around 65 percent of the aircraft-based observations into the GSF model that it normally does. 
""We are anticipating the substantial reduction in the availability of US AMDAR data to continue over the coming weeks, likely to generate some measure of impact on the output of our numerical weather prediction systems,"" Christopher Hill of the NOAA said in a March news release. That same release revealed that between March 3rd and March 23rd the number of aircraft reports over Europe received and used at the ECMWF dropped 35 percent with a 42 percent reduction, globally.
Thankfully, meteorologists won’t be flying completely blind with so many airlines effectively out of commission. The ECMWF began pulling wind data from the Aeolus satellite in January. As for the NOAA, “while the automated weather reports from commercial aircraft provide exceptionally valuable data for forecast models, we also collect billions of Earth observations from other sources that feed into our models, such as weather balloons, surface weather observation network, radar, satellites and buoys,” the spokesperson told Engadget. “Additionally, NOAA will soon be using COSMIC-2 GPS radio occultation satellite data to further increase observations throughout the depth of the tropical atmosphere.”"

Facebook has removed pseudoscience from the list of categories advertisers can use to target people, following an investigation from The Markup. While no longer available as of Wednesday, the social media platforms ad portal showed more than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, The Markup reports.
Weve removed this targeting option to prevent potential abuse in ads, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed in an email to The Verge.
Its curious why Facebook had such a category available, even as the company works to combat misinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic on its platforms. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post on April 16th that Facebook had added warning labels on 40 million posts related to COVID-19.
Coronavirus misinformation and hoaxes have been rampant on social media, including everything from lies about Bill Gates to false claims that 5G towers caused the virus. And overhyped cures and treatments have been a particular area of concern. 
Zuckerberg said last week that the company was adding a Get The Facts section with articles written by independent fact-checking partners debunking misinformation about the coronavirus and would connect people who had previously engaged with harmful misinformation about COVID-19 to accurate information. 
Among the new initiatives Facebook announced was a box that will appear for people who liked, reacted to, or commented on a post that Facebook later removed for misinformation, with a link to the World Health Organizations website. 
The new initiatives to battle coronavirus misinformation followed a report by human rights group Avaaz, which found 100 pieces of misinformation regarding the virus on Facebook were shared more than 1.7 million times and viewed about 117 million times. Avaaz urged Facebook to inform anyone who has viewed coronavirus misinformation on its platforms and tell them exactly what was incorrect.

The European Union is locking down its borders with all other nations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced today that all external borders for countries within the group will close for 30 days for nonessential travel. People within the EUs 27 member nations can still travel between those countries, although there will be some restrictions, and Europeans stranded abroad will be repatriated.
The EU includes countries particularly hard hit by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, including Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. The decision follows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing yesterday that hed be closing his countrys border to everyone but Canadians and US citizens. Last week, US President Donald Trump banned travel from all European countries into the nation. Trump initially exempted the UK and Ireland, but he expanded the ban a few days later. Many other countries have restricted travel from abroad and even limited their own citizens movement at home. (The New York Timeshas created a comprehensive list of those decisions.) 
The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed governments to not only encourage local social distancing, but also to limit the number of people entering their countries in an effort to stop the virus from spreading further. Europe closing its borders is one of the biggest expressions of that strategy yet."

Ford is the latest automaker to announce that it will start making desperately needed ventilators that are crucial for treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19. The automaker announced Monday that it will manufacture ventilators for General Electrics health care division, which has licensed a simplified design that does not need electricity from a Florida ventilator company called Airon. Ford has already been working with GE to increase Airons production and is helping make masks and protective hoods for health care workers.
Ford will pay 500 United Auto Workers-represented volunteer employees to build the ventilators at one of the automakers components factories in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is currently shut down due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company will build the ventilators around the clock starting the week of April 20th. Ford says it expects to be able to build 1,500 of them by the end of April, 12,000 by the end of May, and 50,000 by July, eventually reaching a rate of 30,000 per month. 
Ford joins fellow Detroit automaker General Motors in helping make ventilators, which are expected to be in short supply as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in the US and around the world. GM announced on Friday that it will start manufacturing more complicated ventilators in April on behalf of Ventec Life Systems, hours before President Trump announced he was invoking the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to force the automaker to help with the shortage. GM plans to eventually make 10,000 powered ventilators per month, but will start with hundreds in April, according to Ventec.
Tesla is also examining how to help manufacture ventilators and has even bought some from China to send to hospitals in the meantime. Earlier on Monday, the rocket-launching arm of Richard Bransons space company announced it has also developed a device that could help patients who are having trouble breathing due to COVID-19.
In response to the need for ventilators, as well as the economic impact of the pandemic, a number of workers in GEs aviation division decided to stop work on Monday to protest cuts the company has made. The union workers called on the company to let them make ventilators instead. GE Healthcare is already a large manufacturer of ventilators.
When asked why GE Healthcare is tapping Ford to make these ventilators, Tom Westrick, the divisions vice president and chief quality officer, said: Our decision to select Ford was based specifically on speed, and our ability to increase capacity as fast as we could.

The timing couldn't be more appropriate. With people being urged to stay at home to reduce the spread of COVID-19, Prime Video usage is bound to go up -- and that includes driving viewership by family members who might not have used the service much before.

DoorDash says it started piloting this functionality at the start of the year. However, it decided to accelerate the launch as the severity of the current situation became apparent. As of Wednesday, there were almost 190,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US, according to TheNew York Times.
DoorDash isn't the only company shuttling essential items. On Tuesday, Walgreens announced an expanded partnership with Postmates to deliver from more than 7,000 stores across the US.

The company hinted at even larger numbers to come, too, as the spike only began late in the quarter (that is, March) when lockdowns spread around the world.
This doesn’t mean Roku is profiting from the wave of demand.

The idea of contact tracing is straightforward. When someone is infected with a disease, public health workers need to know who that person has had recent contact with to be able to locate, test and possibly isolate those contacts to stop the disease spreading even further.
For decades, this technique has required painstaking drudgery -- interviewing patients about their every move, calling airlines and managers of restaurants, examining hotel records -- to determine everyone that’s been exposed. This was the case in tracking the paths of HIV, Ebola and measles.
The challenge is that tracing each case typically takes many days. In Wuhan, China, more than 9,000 epidemiologists performed this task, working in teams of five, according to the WHO. According to the latest figures, there are about 83,000 cases of COVID-19 in China. In the US, there are currently tens of thousands of new known cases every day, meaning a similar effort might require tens if not hundreds of thousands of epidemiologists.
Right now, most of the US is under stay-at-home orders because we don’t know who’s infected and who isn’t; to be safe, we’re presuming that anybody could be.
This is where digital stalking comes in. All that detective work could happen in an instant, using a tracking app. Anyone who has had contact with a patient -- shared an elevator or office, bus or train -- gets a message to instruct them on how to get tested. In one UK survey, about three in four respondents said they’d definitely or probably install this sort of app.
Right now, most of the US is under stay-at-home orders because we don’t know who’s infected and who isn’t; to be safe, we’re presuming that anybody could be. In San Francisco and Massachusetts, local authorities are beefing up their contact-tracing capabilities, but for the most part, experts say, we’ve missed the boat on tracking the exact path of virus transmission for now. 
However, effective tracing paired with widespread testing will be pivotal in containing COVID-19 after social distancing ends. For people to work and congregate again, we need to continuously identify and test infected people so they can be individually quarantined. Knowing who does and doesn’t have it could allow us to separate the safe from the vulnerable, allowing society and the economy to gradually sputter back to life.
Here’s the first catch: For contact tracing to be effective, a lot of people need to opt in to tracking. David Bonsall, an Oxford researcher and co-author of the Science paper, has placed ‘a lot’ at about 60 percent of a country’s population. And while smartphone ownership in the US is just over 80 percent, the question is How do you get three quarters of the nation’s smartphones to all persistently share locations?
Enter Apple and Google. Unlike startups, NGOs and university initiatives, these companies already have a critical mass of users. With nothing but a software update, about 3 billion phones globally could have contact-tracing functionality.
Around now, alarm bells might start ringing. Consenting to this kind of global surveillance appears to fly in the face of everything we’ve learned about sound data hygiene. Trust in the technology industry was already in decline before COVID-19. In a worse case scenario, privacy experts fear contact tracing could create the architecture for a more invasive surveillance state -- and new norms that can’t be rolled back.
Consider that Google has hardly covered itself in glory when it comes to being honest about its use of our location. Separately, the US Department of Homeland Security has reportedly bought cellphone location information from private companies for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (aka ICE) to detect undocumented immigrants.
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Israel has tapped cell phone data from its domestic intelligence agency to identify people potentially exposed to the virus. In Korea, mobile alerts broadcast information about nearby infected people, which might include their family name, age and recent locations. In some areas of China, an opaque algorithm built into wallet app Alipay determines someone’s health risk, which in turn determines their ability to take public transport.
“There’s no question that civil liberties have to give way when it comes to a public health crisis like this but any incursions on civil liberties have to be necessary, they have to be effective and they have to be proportional.”
The location-based data initiatives we’ve seen in the US so far have relied on aggregated, anonymized location data -- the kind one might rely on in everyday apps like Google Maps -- released by companies like Facebook, Google and Foursquare. The CDC and regional governments have also reportedly been using this data to see trends of where people  congregate. But this data doesn't give away individual locations.
“There’s no question that civil liberties have to give way when it comes to a public health crisis like this,” said Jay Stanley, a Senior Policy Analyst at the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. “But any incursions on civil liberties have to be necessary, they have to be effective and they have to be proportional.”
With GPS location data considered too revealing, the safe solution thatprojects like COVID Watch and the Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) have been pushing for uses Bluetooth. The system would have every opted-in phone regularly emit anonymous beacons via Bluetooth. Other phones in the vicinity receive and store those unique beacons -- which frequently change -- and emit their own. This creates a record of two phones in proximity to each other, but only known by the two phones.
Should one person later test positive for COVID-19, a health official could ask the patient to send their records to a server that broadcasts to other phones and alert any phone whose records match that they’ve recently encountered a person with the virus, perhaps encouraging them to get tested.
Based on the details so far -- more are still forthcoming -- this is, for the most part, the system Apple and Google have thrown their weight behind."

Turning off the lights has meant shutting off the museum's primary source of revenue, though: admission fees.
In response, NVM has furloughed roughly two thirds of its 18 employees. That means most staff have stopped working and accepted a pay packet, funded by the UK government, that will cover up to 80 percent of their usual wages. Even a small skeleton crew isn't enough to balance the museum's finances, though. Iain Simons, the museum's director of culture and a long-time writer and speaker about video games, estimates that NVM has enough in the bank to last ""a few months.""
If it can't reopen or find additional funding, it's possible the museum will close for good.
It's a depressing fate that management is obviously keen to avoid. Last week, the museum set up a JustGiving page with an £80,000 (roughly $99,385) target. At the time of writing, a little more than 300 people have donated £28,642 (roughly $35,582) to the cause. Simons hopes that the target amount can keep the museum afloat until it officially re-opens. No one is exactly sure how long the quarantine will last, though — not even the UK government. That's why NVM management is also reaching out to members of the video game industry and existing museum patrons.
""Money buys time and people, really,"" Simons said.
The situation might be different if NVM was an accredited museum. It's a legitimate business, backed up by a charity called the British Games Institute (BGI), but it's still working on the accreditation that would potentially unlock funding from Arts Council England and other UK government schemes.
The ""small skeleton crew"" that hasn't been furloughed will be focused on this all important kitemark, as well developing ""what the museum will be when we reopen, and obviously fundraising,"" Simons explained.
The timing of the coronavirus pandemic couldn't be worse.
""You haven't got to be an epidemiologist to work out that we're one of the higher risk spaces.""
Before COVID-19 reached Britain's shores, the museum was apparently flourishing. NVM had experienced its ""busiest half term ever"" in mid-February, according to Simons. ""Just over a month ago, everyone was basically still outside having a brilliant time,"" he explained. There wasn't a huge drop-off in the weekends that followed, either. NVM was aware of COVID-19, though, and took some common sense precautions. ""Obviously, we were cleaning more, and we were doing all the things you'd expect us to do,"" Simons said.
That same month, though, the UK recorded its first internal transmission of COVID-19. ""Fairly suddenly, things escalated in the UK,"" Simons said. NVM knew it would need to take action quickly. The museum, which sits inside Sheffield's Castle House, is packed with consoles and arcade cabinets. Hundreds of sticks and buttons are touched by an assortment of strangers every day. Even the most rigorous cleaning schedule wouldn't be enough to stop the spread of a virus like COVID-19. ""You haven't got to be an epidemiologist to work out that we're one of the higher risk spaces,"" Smith added.
NVM stopped admissions on March 16th, a week before UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a nationwide lockdown. ""I think we were one of the first museums to do that,"" Simon said. ""That was the right call, I think.""
The museum is used to operating on the financial edge.
The original museum, which was based in Nottingham and called the National Videogame Arcade (NVA), opened in 2015 and almost went out of business the following year. As The Guardian reports, the NVA was renting a large building and had 40 staff to pay. ""It became horribly clear, horribly suddenly, that we weren't going to be able to pay salaries,"" Simons told the newspaper in 2016.
The team managed to attract investment, though, from Games Workshop founder Ian Livingstone and British developers including Sumo Digital (Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, Snake Pass) and Playground Games (Forza Horizon), among others. The funding also created the National Videogame Foundation, which oversaw both the NVA and Nottingham-based GameCity Festival.
In February 2018, the Foundation merged with the newly-formed BGI. Seven months later, though, the organization was forced to move the arcade. ""The thing about Nottingham is that it was on five floors,"" Simons explained. ""There were lots of different rooms. It was like a badly designed Quake level of a museum. It was really, really exciting but incredibly difficult to run."" When the Nottingham site closed, Simons told the BBC that it could not be ""judged a commercial success.""
""If you want an easy life, don't open a museum about video games,"" he told Engadget.
The new location, which also introduced the National Videogame Museum name, is a single floor that can be easily reconfigured to accommodate new additions and exhibits. It's not the most luxurious space, and the organization doesn't have the money to create flashy exhibits like London's Science Museum or Design Museum. But it's got what's most important — a truckload of games spanning many different decades — and other interesting objects, including merchandise and design documents, that explain how tentpole titles impacted the industry and popular culture. ""You can play games at home,"" Simons said. ""What we're trying to do is bring the story of video game culture, beyond just the games, to the public.""
With the support of the BGI, the museum has apparently made great strides in the last year. ""We were getting to a point of stability,"" Simons said. ""and then guess what? This comes along."" He is well aware, though, that a museum isn't the highest priority right now. Culture and game preservation is important, but people's health and financial security obviously come first. ""I'm not suggesting for a second that the threat to the NVM is, in any way, comparative with what's actually going on out there in the street, or out there in the country in people's homes,"" Simons said.
Still, it's a site that many would be sad to lose.
Simons is upbeat about the situation, though. He's still thinking about the museum's long-term ambitions and how it can come back with a bang once the quarantine is lifted. ""At some point, [COVID-19] is going to be over,"" he said. ""We're all going to go back outside. I guess I really want to make sure that we're there with new ideas and new ways to welcome people to the museum when we get to that."" He's focused on the museum's survival, of course, but believes it's equally important that people think about the future. ""We need to be able to think in the hardest of times,"" he said. ""Being able to think positively about that is, I think, the real challenge.""
If you want to make a donation to the museum, you can do so here."

Baldwin, Sony Salzman",Self-quarantine may provide option to slow spread of coronavirus,The CDC is warning Americans to prepare for the spread of novel coronavirus.,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/quarantine-provide-option-slow-spread-coronavirus/story?id=69299482,https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/coronavirus-us-gty-rc-200228_hpMain_1_16x9_992.jpg,2020-02-29T15:51:57Z,"Some people show up to work no matter what -- snow, hail, sleet or illness. But muscling through is not always the best choice when sick. People are commonly told to stay home when they're sick to avoid spreading their germs.
The thought process with self-isolation or self-quarantine with the new coronavirus is similar.
""With the expectation that there will be community spread within the U.S., we need to make preparations to mitigate the spread of the virus,"" said Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is a respiratory illness that is spread primarily from person to person by people who are in close contact with one another (about 6 feet).
When an infected person sneezes or coughs, the respiratory droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. These droplets can then be inhaled and cause infection. Public health officials are still learning about how this novel coronavirus spreads, but they think it might be possible to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus, and then touching the face. The fact that the virus is so easily transmitted among people in close contact makes self-isolation a very important and effective measure to combat its spread.
But how is self-quarantine different from self-isolation?
""Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of well individuals who have been exposed to an infectious disease,"" whereas self-isolation, ""separates ill persons and restricts their movements until they are no longer contagious,"" said Dr. Bruce Ribner, medical director at Emory University Hospital's Serious Communicable Disease Unit. In both instances, the idea is to stop the spread of the infectious disease.
Self-isolation is something many people already do on their own.
""An example of self-isolation can be when you get the flu, you call out of work,"" said Dr. Eric Cioe-Peña, director of Global Health for Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, New York.
""People who are infected with a contagious disease should always avoid contact with others if at all possible,"" Ribner said. Cioe-Peña added, ""When you get sick, please don't go the ER and sit in the waiting room for 7 hours. Don't get healthy people sick.""
""In the event of a possible exposure to COVID-19, it's vital to impose a self-quarantine at home for the duration of the incubation period,"" currently believed to be 14 days, Glatter said. He said people who feel sick should stay home, closely monitor symptoms and take their temperature twice a day. If people develop new symptoms or a high fever, they should alert their healthcare providers.
""If you are coughing or have a fever, wearing a mask at home will serve as added protection for persons who may live with you at home,"" he said. ""It's also vital to wash your hands frequently to reduce the chance of transmission of the virus. This is the single most important way to protect yourself and others you may live with.""
The CDC recommends consulting with local health departments and health care professions to assess several factors when engaging in self-isolation:
-Make sure the sick person is stable enough to stay at home
-Ensure an appropriate caregiver is available to stay with the sick person at home. 
-It's best if the sick person has a separate bedroom to recover, without sharing close space with others. 
-Make sure the sick person has access to food, water and other necessities.
-Keep in mind that adults over 65, young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems from autoimmune diseases or chronic heart, lung or kidney conditions are at increased risk of complications from the coronavirus.
""The majority of people who get it COVID-19 will be fine,"" Cioe-Peña said.
""People are more likely to identify as sick if they are allowed to stay home,"" he said. ""They are less likely to report they are sick if they know they are going to be taken to some isolation unit.""
Asking people to self-quarantine is a more effective public health approach than other types of quarantines, like mandatory ones.
As cases of COVID-19 are likely to increase, everyone can do their part to help stop the spread of this outbreak.
""Self-isolation and self-quarantine work only as well as the individual's willingness to protect others,"" Ribner said.

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal disease control and prevention agency, said in a statement translated by NPR that the serological tests, also known as antibody tests, will help officials monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The institute believes that people who have had the virus — all of whom should now have COVID-19 antibodies in their blood — should have immunity from contracting the virus again, though it's unknown how long it lasts or if antibodies give full immunity.
Germany, which has a population of 83 million people, has had 149,381 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 5,140 deaths from the virus.
The country has tested for COVID-19 on a larger scale than other countries in an attempt to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Officials have been testing an estimated 120,000 people a day.

Something is loading.
Antibody testing has been seen as a crucial step to reopening public spaces, but the World Health Organization warned on Friday that antibodies can't guarantee longterm immunity to COVID-19.
The WHO said antibody tests can show if a person has contracted the virus, but not necessarily if they're immune to infection.
Science surrounding antibody testing is still developing, too, and concerns have emerged around the tests being inaccurate, rushed, and improperly marketed. More than 100 organizations are selling such tests in the US, but the US Food and Drug Administration has only approved a few.
Germany's antibody testing could help provide more information on how many people have antibodies, at what levels, and what protection they could confer against the novel virus. The program launched last week and officials expect results sometime in May.
Officials said nationwide testing will take place in three parts. First, officials will examine samples from people who have donated blood. Then they will seek samples from people in regions hit hard by the coronavirus, and lastly they plan to study Germany's larger population.
The Koch Institute said officials hope to examine 5,000 blood samples every two weeks.
""It is not yet known how many people in Germany have actually gone through an infection and are therefore immune,"" the Koch Institute said in an April 9 press release translated by NPR. ""The infection is often mild or even unnoticed."""

In the context of this global pandemic, feeling overwhelmed by all the negative information is a natural response. But researchers are also hard at work trying to understand, treat, and prevent the new coronavirus. We take a look at some of their results.
For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.
As of yesterday, the total number of deaths from COVID-19 across the world has surpassed 10,000. 
Currently, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe stands at 244,000. 
These numbers can induce restlessness and worry. 
The importance of taking precautions and staying safe during this global pandemic cannot be overestimated, but it is also helpful to look at some emerging research that could pave the way for future treatment and prevention.
In this article, we round up some of this evidence, which has featured recently on Medical News Today.
Researchers in Hong Kong have evaluated the impact that the outbreak has had on 43 public hospitals there. 
The numbers are encouraging: In the first 6 weeks since the start of the outbreak, 413 healthcare workers dealt with 42 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of these employees, 11 had unprotected exposure to the new coronavirus.
As a result of implementing best practices for infection control, none of the healthcare staff contracted the virus during the study period. Furthermore, no hospital-acquired infections occurred. 
Dr. Vincent C.C. Cheng, from the Department of Microbiology at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong, and his colleagues conclude:
“Appropriate hospital infection control measures can prevent healthcare-associated transmission of the [new] coronavirus […] Vigilance in hand hygiene practice, wearing of surgical masks in the hospital, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment in patient care […] are the key infection control measures to prevent hospital transmission of the virus.”
A study involving four rhesus macaques found that contracting SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — protected against future reinfections. 
The scientists reinfected two of the four monkeys with the virus 28 days after the initial infection. 
A total of “96 nasopharyngeal and anal swabs tested negative after the reexposure of SARS-CoV-2,” report the researchers. The euthanasia and necropsy of one of the two monkeys confirmed these results. 
“Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have […] vital implications for vaccine design [and disease prognosis],” conclude the authors of the study. 
MNT contacted Martin Bachmann, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom, on the broader subject of COVID-19 and building up immunity to the virus. 
“I can tell you, if you got [COVID-19] and you got really sick, I am sure that will make an antibody response that will also last.” 
– Prof. Martin Bachmann
Prof. Bachmann, who is also the head of the department of immunology at the University of Bern in Switzerland, continued: “But, if you have the virus and it only replicates a little and never really reaches the lymph nodes, then maybe you don’t really make [an antibody response], but then you have not really been sick. [Of] anyone who has been really sick, I would be surprised to find anyone who didn’t make an antibody response.”
A trial is currently taking place to test a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for the first time in humans. 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have funded the trial, which is taking place at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.
In the trial, 45 healthy volunteers will receive a vaccine that contains a segment of genetic code copied from SARS-CoV-2. As the vaccine does not contain the actual SARS-CoV-2, the participants will not develop COVID-19. 
Government officials caution that it may take 12–18 months before the vaccine reaches the market and explain that the main purpose of this current trial is to make sure that there are no serious side effects.
However, many other efforts are underway for devising new vaccines. In this article, our research editor, Yella Hewings-Martin, Ph.D., rounded up several projects that identified a potential vaccine and therapy targets for SARS-CoV-2.
Doctors may be able to use an age-old method called “passive antibody therapy” to treat COVID-19, suggests research featuring in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.
The researchers who authored the paper say, “Deployment of this option requires no research or development,” as the method has been around since the 1930s.
The method involves collecting blood from a person who has had the virus and recovered from it. Using the serum — the part that contains infection-fighting antibodies — researchers hope to be able to inject another person, thus either preventing an infection or helping to fight it off.
Dr. Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD, and co-author of the new paper, says: 
“It’s all doable — but to get it done, it requires effort, organization, resources… and people who have recovered from the disease who can donate the blood.”
A new case study, appearing in the journal Nature Medicine, documents the case of a COVID-19 patient who recovered from the condition within days. 
The patient was a 47-year-old woman who had contracted the virus in Wuhan, China, and the researchers examined her immune response in their effort to understand her recovery. 
Prof. Katherine Kedzierska, Head of the Human T cell Laboratory in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, and her colleagues found an increase in immunoglobulins — the most common type of antibodies — in the woman’s blood samples.
The scientists also found a high number of key immune cells, such as specialized helper T cells, killer T cells, and B cells, 7–9 days after symptom onset.
“This is an incredible step forward in understanding what drives recovery of COVID-19. People can use our methods to understand the immune responses in larger COVID-19 cohorts and also understand what’s lacking in those who have fatal outcomes.”

The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)Much is still unknown about Covid-19, but one thing is certain: Owning a gun does not make you any safer from it. But that didn't stop the Trump administration from caving to the firearm industry by treating gun store workers just like the real frontline responders-- police, doctors, nurses-- in new advisory guidelines issued to state and local officials that designate who should be allowed to keep working during the pandemic.
It is both shameful and nonsensical for the federal government to deem gun stores essential, a special privilege that millions of other shuttered small businesses can only dream about. The argument for keeping grocery stores and pharmacies open during a pandemic is self-evident. People need to be able to access food and medication in order to preserve public health, so it's worth the risk of allowing people to congregate -- while observing social distancing.
This calculus clearly doesn't apply to firearm sales. In fact, when you examine the evidence, it's clear that allowing gun stores to stay open in a time of self-quarantine and heightened stress will likely send more people to the hospital just when our medical system is already under unprecedented strain.
We only need to look back to the 2008 financial crisis for indications that the economic conditions created by coronavirus could be deadly. Researchers estimate that 4,750 more Americans died by suicide during the Great Recession than would have been expected otherwise, and they attribute some of this increase to rising unemployment. Given that this week's unemployment numbers already dwarf what we saw then, there is good reason to believe that the risk of suicide will rise, and that's even more true for people with easy access to a gun -- about half of all suicide deaths are with a firearm, according to CDC data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. All told, an average of 22,926 people die by gun suicide every year.
But firearm suicide is not the only form of gun violence that needs to be considered when factoring in whether to keep gun stores open. At least 4.6 million American children live in homes with unsecured guns, and many of those children are now confined to those homes, with lots of free time on their hands -- and lots of new worries. Recently, a 13-year-old in New Mexico was killed when his cousin allegedly shot him with a gun that the cousin said he brought home to ""protect"" himself during the pandemic. In addition, parents -- especially parents who own guns -- should be aware that research has shown a link between social isolation and suicide in young people. 
Those victims of domestic violence who are now staying inside with their abusers around the clock are also at greater risk. Cities across the country are seeing dramatic spikes in domestic violence calls. For instance, as coronavirus cases increased in Tennessee, the Nashville YWCA reported a 55% increase in calls during the first two weeks of March when compared to last year during the same time. And again, the combination of more domestic violence incidents and more guns in circulation is cause for alarm. When a firearm is present in domestic violence situations, women are five times more likely to be killed, according to a study.
The first step to reducing these types of gun violence is ensuring that every gun in every home is securely stored. That's why the organization I represent, Everytown for Gun Safety, is aggressively promoting our Be SMART program, which encourages gun owners to keep their firearms locked, unloaded, and separate from ammunition.
Unfortunately, such common sense efforts to prevent avoidable tragedies are being undermined by the gun industry, which jumped at the opportunity to exploit the pandemic for every last cent. On the marketing front, they've been using time-tested fear tactics to drive up gun sales. These days, the National Rifle Association's social media feeds read like something out of a dystopian fantasy novel. According to the gun lobby, we live in ""a dangerous world"" of ""gun-grabbing politicians"" and ""reported prisoner furloughs,"" a world where ""the 2nd Amendment is often all we have."" 
In a new low, the NRA is using this deadly Covid-19 pandemic to advance its radical agenda and sell more guns. And while the group argues that closing gun stores violates the Second Amendment, there's nothing in the Constitution that says the Second Amendment is a super-right above other rights, or that requires gun stores to be singled out for special treatment during the most serious public health emergency of the last century. 
On the political front, lobbyists for the gun industry have leaned hard on public officials to let gun stores stay open, and the Trump administration folded like a house of straw. This should come as no surprise -- in 2016, the NRA spent more than $30 million on President Donald Trump's election effort, making the organization the single largest independent outside spender to his campaign.
In the years since, Trump has faithfully followed the gun lobby's lead and refused to take major action to prevent gun violence.
Luckily, the Trump administration's guidelines for essential businesses that should stay open during the pandemic are only advisory, and state and local officials are free to do what's best for their residents. They should consider that with every additional day that gun stores stay open, the number of unsecured guns in American homes will rise. The risk of those guns falling into the wrong hands is one we simply can't afford.
It's time for America's lawmakers to hold gun stores to the same rules as other nonessential businesses, so our nation's doctors and nurses can focus on what is truly essential: fighting the coronavirus."

 (CNN)My Covid-19 survival story is probably similar to those of a lot of other people who didn't experience the worst of the disease. It was early April when my test -- which I only took after my daughter Kate, a second-year medical school student, diagnosed me in March -- came back positive. At the time, I had body aches and fatigue, the latter of which was particularly acute in the evening and at night. 
I had lost much of my appetite but was forcing myself to drink Gatorade. I suddenly began craving bagels and English muffins -- even though I normally refrain from eating those kinds of ""bad"" carbs. While I had lost much of my taste and smell, I couldn't get enough of English muffins with peanut butter. 
Thankfully, I also had Netflix. And I distracted myself by watching ""Tiger King,"" which I now deeply regret. That docuseries made me feel worse about the state of American humanity. 
Why? Because its star -- Joe Exotic, the gun toting, polygamist and former gubernatorial candidate in Oklahoma -- was a deeply troubling character who seemed to bring the most disturbing elements of our society to the forefront. Perhaps I'm a bit predisposed to dislike Joe Exotic, who owned an exotic animal park, since I was a co-sponsor of the Big Cat Public Safety Act in 2017, which sought to limit the owning of big cats as pets and stop their display in roadside zoos.
But I also found Joe Exotic's behavior reprehensible. To give you an example, he made threats against his nemesis, Carole Baskin, founder of Big Cat Rescue -- even shooting a blow-up dummy dressed to look like her. Who does that?
Joe Exotic also had a three-way wedding with two other men. And while I am supportive of marriage equality, it does not extend to polygamy. These kinds of actions, when taken together, further highlight his instability and flagrant contempt for authority. 
Fortunately, I found plenty of other programs on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu that were more inspiring, humorous and less depressing. For example, I watched the Amazon Prime miniseries on ""Gallipoli,"" a tragic story of the failed British Dardanelles campaign in Turkey during World War I, costing the lives of many thousands of Australian and New Zealand soldiers as well. 
I also snuck in a season of the hilarious show ""Fleabag,"" about a young, promiscuous British woman and her many escapades. 
And I even indulged my wife's love of Jane Austen, watching ""Emma,"" which could cure anyone's insomnia and is a stark reminder why I own more than one television.
I also watched a lot of CNN, where, in healthy times, I am a political commentator. The network's coverage is largely focused on the pandemic -- and I must say that seeing images of people across America and the world fall victim to this deadly disease is a tragedy of epic proportions. 
Since the pandemic began spreading in the US, there have been countless stories of individuals who have contracted the coronavirus. Some have been heartbreakingly severe; others have been seemingly asymptomatic. For me, it was somewhere in between. There has thankfully been no tragic plot twist -- just a very real experience with the disease that has defined the start of my 2020.
And my time at home has given me the space to reflect on the scope of this pandemic -- how it appears to be a toxic mix of fear, economic crisis and public health menace wrapped into one never ending, catastrophic event. 
That said, I have no doubt we will prevail over this pandemic if we remain patient, smart and determined. We must all exercise good judgment, which means maintaining social distance, practicing proper hygiene and continuing to shelter in place so that the number of new cases per day drops and the economy can reopen -- sooner rather than later. We must also increase our testing capacity, since more testing means better data and a stronger ability to track the spread of the virus.
And for those who are in a position to help others, now is when we need it the most. The hope is that plasma from someone who has recovered from the virus can help treat those with more severe symptoms. 
I look forward to donating my plasma as soon as I'm given the all clear by my doctor. And there are real signs I'm on the road to recovery and may soon be able to contribute (and maybe stop watching as much television). For the last three weeks, I've largely been unable to exercise -- something I normally enjoy and do quite regularly.
As I've struggled against fatigue, I've had to limit myself to walking the dog around my Allentown neighborhood -- all while practicing social distancing from my neighbors. But over Easter weekend, I walked for three miles and then slowly jogged on my treadmill for another two miles each day. And it felt pretty good -- actually, it felt great. 
In the aftermath of the Easter and Passover observances, I must give thanks to frontline workers in health care, public safety, life science and medical technology, trucking, logistics, agriculture, grocery stores and others who risk their well-being for the benefit of the rest of us who are sheltered in place.

 (CNN)The need for commercial drivers has skyrocketed amid America's rapidly changing economy, where giants of shipping and delivery services are already bowing under the weight of at least 42 states' Covid-19-related stay-at-home orders. Businesses like Amazon, Walmart and Instacart are hiring hundreds of thousands of temporary workers, while shipping companies like UPS and FedEx suspended their service guarantees indefinitely due to increased volume and worker shortage.
But despite being employed in an essential line of work, some deaf and hard-of-hearing drivers fear their jobs are at risk as they await a crucial ruling from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) about whether hearing tests are a valid requirement for a commercial driver's license. 
Comments closed in February on a petition filed by the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) arguing that the hearing tests are discriminatory. Now proponents of the petition worry that FMCSA, a subset of the Department of Transportation, will try to throw out the petition while the nation's attentions are fixed on the current crisis. Several NAD members I interviewed have been working with the FMCSA and cited a history of FMCSA's negative language regarding the pilot program and ableist comments by those involved in the industry posted in response to the petition among other factors as reasons for concern. 
In reality, a study by the American Trucking Association suggests that the nation was experiencing a serious shortage of commercial truck drivers even before the arrival of Covid-19, one that estimates suggest could leave over 160,000 unfilled positions over the next decade. With a lack of qualified individuals in the field, it seems reasonable to remove unnecessary barriers to entry; nevertheless, deaf drivers continue to experience pushback in their fight for equal opportunity. 
Deaf people often face questions about whether they are allowed to drive. Thanks to the advocacy work of the NAD in the 1920s, early bans were overturned and deaf and hard-of-hearing people are allowed to obtain noncommercial licenses in all 50 US states. Studies have shown that deaf drivers are as safe as their hearing counterparts, and may even have some advantages behind the wheel, like fewer distractions and increased peripheral vision. 
Yet, until recently, deaf workers were consistently barred from the commercial driving sphere. In 2006, a federal court upheld the decision that UPS could no longer prevent deaf drivers from applying. Meanwhile, FMCSA continued to maintain its hearing requirement until a 2012 pilot program began issuing waivers for the hearing test. According to Howard Rosenblum, CEO and director of legal services for the NAD, over 600 waivers and renewals were procured via the program. Though the process can be arduous, he said in an email pointing to the pilot's success, the NAD's current petition seeks a permanent repeal of the hearing requirement. 
""Exemptions are not a long-term solution,"" said Zainab Alkebsi, the NAD's policy counsel, in an email, because ""the experience is not equivalent to those of other CDL truckers."" Deaf drivers must wait months to receive an exemption, and, since the waivers cover only a two-year period, they have to keep reapplying -- their licenses could be revoked if FMCSA rules to keep the hearing test.
The red tape is both unfair and unnecessary. ""The exemptions were intended as a pilot to determine whether deaf and hard-of-hearing people who use the CDLs to drive trucks could do so safely,"" Alkebsi said. ""And the results have borne out that they are indeed safe drivers."" 
Still, opponents of the hearing requirement repeal continue to argue ""safety issues,"" though the concerns appear to have no scientific backing. Deaf commercial driver and secretary of the Deaf Truckers Union Suzie Helgerson, who found herself drawn to driving rigs as a way to support her family and fulfill a love of traveling, told me in an interview that pre-trip inspections and new technology like light-up indicators help ensure safe operations, while Alkebsi noted everything from notepads and whiteboards to flashing alerts and preprogrammed GPS routes can facilitate safe training.
""CDL instructors who have trained deaf and hard-of-hearing drivers say that it is not difficult to do the training in a safe manner,"" said Alkebsi. ""It is only those CDL instructors who have never trained a deaf or hard-of-hearing person that are expressing these fears.""
Helgerson said the Deaf Trucker's Union will continue to advocate for a repeal of the hearing requirement. Remembering a conversation she once had with a hearing driver about how noisy it was in the cab of his truck, she said the union's work is not just on behalf of today's drivers, but for those who may lose their hearing in the future. ""Our motto is it's all about the skills, not the hearing,"" said Helgerson.
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act 30 years ago, the government made it their duty to protect the rights of disabled workers, but FMCSA's failure to repeal their hearing requirement perpetuates the inequity it's supposed to eschew. Rather than reinforcing old, ableist statutes to assuage corporations, it's time for the federal government to obey its own anti-discriminatory policy, particularly in a time when deaf workers remain ready and willing to put their lives on the front lines of an increasingly essential industry."

The company released its first augmented reality headset in 2018, but the Magic Leap One’s sales barely put a dent in the company’s goal of shipping 100,000 units. This resulted in dozens of layoffs in late 2019, and the company has reportedly been searching for a buyer."

On Sunday, the Paediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) tweeted an ""urgent alert"" from the National Health Service England about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting ""overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters"" -- with some of the children testing positive for Covid-19. 
The urgent alert, sent to UK general practitioners by National Health Service (NHS) England warned that over the last three weeks, ""there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multisystem inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK,"" the Health Service Journal first reported Monday. 
The alert added: ""There is a growing concern that a [covid-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases,"" HSJ added.
In a statement sent over the weekend to medical professionals who look after critically ill children, PICS said ""the cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe Covid-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation."" 
Kawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed. 
The group said that while there had been ""very few cases"" of critically unwell children with Covid-19 admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the UK and around the world, they were aware of a ""small number of children nationally"" who fit the clinical picture described in the NHS alert. 
There are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to Covid-19, but in a report released in April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that children diagnosed with coronavirus in the United States typically have mild cases of the virus. 
The number of Covid-19 cases among children remains small and while some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date, according to the CDC.
Health care professionals urge calm 
Health care professionals have reassured parents that the risk of children becoming severely ill with the virus remains low. 
""Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,"" Professor Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people said in a statement sent to CNN. 
In response to the reports, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that although a small number of children can become severely ill with Covid-19, it is ""very rare,"" with evidence showing that children appear to be least affected by the virus.
""However our advice remains the same: parents should be reassured that children are unlikely to be seriously ill with Covid-19 but if they are concerned about their children's health for any reason, they should seek help from a health professional,"" Viner said. 
Dr. Tina Tan, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, said that the NHS England alert was important information to have here in the United States.
""I think it's really important that an alert like that goes out, not to alarm anybody but to have people be aware of the fact that this can happen. There have been an increased number of cases like this reported in Italy as well as Spain. Here in the US, I think we're just starting to see it,"" Tan told CNN Monday.
""Here in Chicago at Lurie Children's Hospital, we are just starting to see an increase in the number of older adolescents that are being hospitalized with fairly severe Covid disease that is requiring treatment,"" Tan said. ""Here in Chicago, some of the kids have some of the underlying conditions that would predispose you to getting more severe Covid disease, such as obesity and hypertension.""
Tan added that racial disparities are also emerging among Covid-19 cases in children.
""Out of Los Angeles they were reporting that younger African-Americans and Latinos were being affected by Covid more severely and actually being hospitalized,"" Tan said."

Nuro, one of the nation's best-funded self-driving vehicle startups, has begun using its robots to ferry food and medical supplies around a California stadium that has been converted into a coronavirus treatment facility, CEO Dave Ferguson announced on Wednesday.
""We realized that we could potentially use our R2 unmanned vehicles to provide truly contactless delivery of goods, where we remove any possible interaction between a driver dropping off goods and a person picking them up,"" Ferguson wrote. Contactless delivery could reduce the spread of COVID-19.
In a Tuesday phone interview, Nuro policy chief David Estrada told Ars that the robots are ferrying food, supplies, and medical equipment from the parking lot of Sleep Train Arena, home of the Sacramento Kings, into the stadium itself. Human workers at designated locations load the vehicles at one end of a trip and unload them at the other. The vehicles open and close their cargo doors automatically based on hand signals from the workers so they don't have to touch the vehicle.
Nuro's robots are capable of traveling up to 25 miles per hour. But Estrada says that inside the stadium, Nuro will exercise an ""extreme level of caution"" and set a top speed of 5 miles per hour.
Nuro is also planning to provide robot deliveries at a makeshift medical facility located in the San Mateo County Event Center in California, Ferguson said.
The new effort represents a significant shift of focus away from Nuro's core food delivery business. Nuro began testing robot grocery deliveries in Arizona in late 2018. Nuro used its first-generation robot, called the R1, to deliver groceries from Fry's Food, a Kroger subsidiary. From the beginning, Nuro has followed each robot with a chase car containing a human supervisor who could shut it down if it malfunctioned. Ferguson told me early last year that he hoped to stop using chase cars by mid-2019.
Since then, Nuro has shifted its delivery service from Tempe to Houston and developed a new robot, the R2. In February, the federal government gave Nuro some special exemptions to omit featureslike rearview mirrorsthat make no sense in a vehicle with zero occupants, clearing the way to use the vehicles on public roads.
Nuro had planned to start using the R2 in Houston around now. But at the last minute, the company put those plans on hold to focus on the medical supply project. Estrada told Ars that Nuro isn't doing any robot deliveries in Houston right now. Instead, the company is delivering groceries for Houston-area Kroger stores using its fleet of modified Priuses, with a safety driver behind the wheel of each car.
A Nuro spokeswoman told Ars by email that Nuro ""aims to roll out the use of its R2 vehicles"" with partners in Houston ""in the coming weeks."" In addition to Kroger, Nuro also has partnerships with Walmart and Dominos. ""We will start operations with a chase car initially, with the intention to move to full autonomy shortly thereafter,"" the spokeswoman said.
Delivering medical supplies is obviously a worthwhile goal, but I wonder if Nuro's grocery delivery business might ultimately be more helpful in a post-coronavirus world. Nuro's robots are too big to operate inside conventional hospitals, so the potential market for Nuro's robots might be fairly small here. At least one of Nuro's rivals with smaller robots, Kiwibot, is also experimenting with delivering medical supplies.
By contrast, there's massive unmet demand for delivery of groceries and other essential items to people's homes, and contactless deliveries are a huge selling point there, too. Nuro's robots are bigger and faster than robots from other delivery startups, which could allow them to serve areas where the smaller robots aren't practical.
On the other hand, the size and speed of Nuro's robots also make it a bigger engineering challenge to operate them without human supervision, compared to sidewalk delivery robots. Companies like Kiwibot and Starship have had their robots operating without direct human supervision for more than a year now. Nuro says it will be able to do the same thing soon, but we'll have to see when that actually happens."

The pandemic is a challenge for all of us. The economic knock-on effects of the health crisis are, themselves, another crisis. Many people, as humans tend to do, are wildly casting about not just for solutions, but for someone to take the blame. It's hard to take it out directly on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, of course; whether or not one regards a virus as a living thing, it is most certainly not a legal person in any sense.
The office of Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt has apparently decided that, in the absence of any way to sue a virus, the next best course of action is to take the entire nation where the disease originated to court. To that end, Schmitt's office said yesterday it had filed a lawsuit against ""the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party, and other Chinese officials and institutions"" for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The complaint (PDF) first confirms that as of Monday, there were more than 5,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Missouri, from which at least 177 persons had died. It then claims that ""the virus unleashed by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese govenrment has left no community in the world untouched,"" adding that the pandemic ""is the direct result of a sinister campaign of malfeasance and deception"" carried out by all of China's leadership.
Factually, the suit accuses Chinese entities of denying the risk of human-to-human transmission of the disease; silencing whistleblowers; not acting to contain the outbreak; and hoarding personal protective equipment aind instead only exporting ""defective"" equipment to other nations.
""In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real - thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table,"" Schmitt said in a statement, alleging that Chinese authorities ""lied to the world"" and ""must be held accountable.""
""Accountability,"" in this case, would apparently look like a big sack of money. The suit asks for the defendantsi.e., Chinato be required to pay civil penalties, punitive damages, compensatory damages, and restitution, including reimbursing the cost of the state's ""abatement efforts.""
To be sure, almost every state and local government is suddenly facing an immediate spending and budget crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tax revenues are drying upyou can't tax paychecks that aren't being issued to laid-off workers, meals that aren't being served in closed restaurants, retail sales that aren't being made in closed stores, or nights not spent in closed hotelsjust as spending on unemployment and other health and social needs is skyrocketing.
Suing China, however, is not going to help. Even if every word in the suit had meritwhich is a fairly big ""if""US law for the most part prohibits civil suits against foreign states. A handful of other coronavirus-related suits filed against China in other states are likely to fail quickly for the same reasons.
A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that the suit had no factual or legal basis, adding, ""These so-called lawsuits are purely malicious abuses.""
The administration has been focused on the Chinese origin of the virus since its emergence became public news in January, repeatedly demanding to have it called the ""Wuhan virus"" or the ""China virus.""
In more recent days, the unsupported claim that China created the novel coronavirus in a laboratory, then tried to cover up its spread, has become a popular talking point among conservative news outlets such as Fox News, and the President on Friday called for an investigation. There is no scientific evidence that this is true, and last week Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, told reporters, ""A group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences in bats as they evolve. The mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now are totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human."""

A study observing COVID-19 patients has found no evidence that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19, made a difference to the chance that patients would need a ventilator. The results also suggested that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher rate of death than those who werent treated with the drug.
The study was not a randomized clinical trial, which means that the evidence it offers is tentative and should be interpreted with caution. It was also published on preprint server medRxiv, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed.
But interpreting the evidence with caution does not mean disregarding it completely. This study is one of a growing number telling us that we don't yet know enough about hydroxychloroquine, adding more weight to the argument that we need to wait for better-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials before we start widespread use of a drug with significant side effects.
Premature
Some small studies have given us reasons to think that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could have potential as treatments for COVID-19. In some cases, the findings come from experiments in cultured cells, which won't necessarily translate directly to using the drugs in sick humans. In others, the findings come from small studies that have critical flaws like using very small groups of patients, having no control group, or excluding patients who died from analysis.
Normally, such research would be deemed hypothesis-generating at best, wrote doctors Jinoos Yazdany and Alfred Kim in an opinion piece in the Annals of Internal Medicine. And they were released at the same time that other early studies were finding no evidence that these drugs help COVID-19 patients.
However, early hypeincluding repeated promotion from President Trumpled to a runaway train of enthusiasm for the drugs. The Food and Drug Administration authorized treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine despite the lack of good evidence for their efficacy, sparking backlash from former FDA leaders.
These drugs have a range of possible adverse effects, including serious cardiac damage. Using them for critically ill COVID-19 patients therefore not only runs the risk of not helping, but also of actively harming people. The worldwide run on the drugs and resulting shortages are also a problem for patients using them for conditions like lupus, where they have been found to be effective.
A range of clinical trials are now underway to establish whether these drugs are actually beneficial. In the meantime, the FDA authorization means that there is a growing pile of data from patients who have been treated with them.
Testing on the fly
The US Veterans Health Administration is a national system of clinics, hospitals and other medical centers. Because its a single organization, data on patients is gathered in a consistent way, which makes it easier for researchers to compare apples with apples.
A team of researchers used VHA data to track the outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 patients at veterans hospitals who were treated with just hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus an antibiotic, or neither of the drugs. They found that 27.8 percent of the 97 patients treated with just hydroxychloroquine died, compared to 11.4 percent of the 158 patients who werent treated with hydroxychloroquine at all, and 22.1 percent of the 113 patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic. Rates of ventilation were similar across the three groups.
This evidence is weaker than a randomized controlled trial because the patients who were given different treatments may have had other important differences to begin with. In a randomized trial, patients are assigned different treatments (or a placebo) randomly, which means that different groups should all have a roughly similar mix of people who are very sick or only a little bit sick, old and young, and so on.
In a retrospective study like this one, the doctors may have given the hydroxychloroquine treatment only to the sickest patients, in which case wed expect that group to have worse outcomes. There are ways to try to account for this lack of randomization in the statistical tests that researchers use to calculate the risks across different groups, but these adjustments require the researchers to work out what other factors might complicate the analysisa difficult challenge with a random population like this one.
The patients also werent representative of the wider population. They were all men and all older than 59 years, which means that the results wouldnt necessarily be the same in younger groups or among women.
The results dont mean that hydroxychloroquine is definitely useless or that clinical trials should be halted. Recent NIH guidance for clinicians treating COVID-19 patients says that there currently isnt enough evidence to recommend for or against treating with hydroxychloroquine, and that remains true.
But they do offer more evidence suggesting that we dont yet know enough to forge ahead with using the drugs as treatment. The authors of the study acknowledge the shortcomings of their own work but argue that the results nonetheless highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs."

On March 1, New York City confirmed its first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. By the end of the month, thousands were infected, and hospitals were struggling to manage the influx of patients. On Wednesday, JAMA published an analysis of the outcomes of thousands of patients who ended up at a large hospital system in the city and surrounding areas. While the data is annoyingly incomplete, it does provide a broad overview of how the pandemic is interacting with the health demographics in the United States.
Some of this is expected, as the sorts of pre-existing conditions that exacerbate COVID-19obesity, hypertension, and diabetescause problems here. The study also suggests some dramatically bad outcomes for older patients who ended up on ventilators, with 97 percent mortality for those over 65. But the study period ended before the outcomes of most patients could be tracked, so this number has to be treated with significant caution.
At admission
The work is based on the electronic patient records from the Northwell Health hospital system, which has a dozen hospitals in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. The researchers (Safiya Richardson, Jamie S. Hirsch, and Mangala Narasimhan) pulled out the records of anyone with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the period between March 1 and April 4 of this year. This produced a study population of 5,700 patients, which is quite large. However, the study cut off tracking the patients on April 4; if a case hadn't resulted in discharge or death by then, the outcomes couldn't be analyzed. Followups for those who were discharged was also limited, with the medium length being only four days.
Because the case level went up dramatically over the course of the month, there were only outcomes for less than half of the patients who started the study (2,643 of them, to be exact). So, while the study provides some insight into the factors that may influence whether someone's COVID-19 symptoms are bad enough to get them sent to a hospital, most of the participants were still in the hospital when the study period ended. This could potentially distort the numbers, especially those regarding survival, since there was an end point for everyone who died during this period.
So, what can we say about the demographics of US cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to warrant hospitalization? As seen in other countries, the population skews considerably older, with a median age of 63. (Although the age range runs from a low of less than a year old to a 107-year-old patient.) More males than females had severe problems, as the total population was under 40 percent female.
In general, the people had some significant health problems before the virus sent them to the hospital. Over half of them had hypertension; over 40 percent were clinically obese; and a third had diabetes. A measure of their general health called the Charlson Comorbidity Index indicates that the people with this level of problems typically have roughly even odds of living another decade. In contrast, only about 1 percent had an infection with another respiratory virus, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 wasn't generally taking advantage of damage caused by a previous infection.
Post-hospitalization
So what happens to these patients once they're brought in to the hospital? Among the 2,634 patients who had died or were discharged, a bit over 14 percent ended up in the intensive care unit. Just under that (12.2 percent) required mechanical ventilation, and just over 3 percent needed dialysis. Kidney problems appear to be a regular issue among a subset of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. The presence of diabetes (which also causes kidney problems) as a pre-existing condition increased the frequency of a need for dialysis.
The eye-opening figures come when the mortality of these patients were considered (which was again, limited to the population that had died or been discharged). Those who had been put on the ventilator among this population died 88 percent of the time. For those older than 65, the mortality reached a staggering 97 percent. For those who didn't need a ventilator, the mortality rate was 27 percent for those over 65 and 20 percent for those below. Nobody under the age of 20 died.
It's important at this point to reiterate the issue pointed out above: most of the patients in the study weren't included in this part of the analysis, because they were still in the hospital when the study period ended. Tracking all these patients until they either die or are discharged will almost certainly lower the mortality rates. This was also the first month of treating COVID-19 patients, and it's possible that the hospital staff will improve with greater experience with the disease. Still, results like these seem to have caused some facilities to rethink the use of ventilators.
Overall, this study largely reinforces findings from other countries: men have more problems than women, the elderly are hit extremely hard, and pre-existing conditions greatly enhance the risks posed by SARS-CoV-2. They also drive home the big fear regarding COVID-19: a sizable percentage of the patients who require hospitalization need extensive stays and aggressive interventions, enhancing the danger that the pandemic can overwhelm our healthcare system. It's only by limiting the number of people infected at once that our hospital system is able to handle the number of patients that need this sort of attention.
But it's also important to note that this study doesn't answer some critical questions. We're still getting confused and somewhat contradictory results regarding how many of the people infected eventually need hospitalization. And we don't really know the mortality rate among the ones who do. By this point, at the end of April, the same researchers would undoubtedly be able to know the full history of everyone admitted during the study period and thus provide a better measure of thatand that work has almost certainly already been done. We'll probably have to wait a few more weeks, however, for the results to make their way through peer review.

Wisconsin's controversial decision to hold a primary election in the middle of the coronavirus epidemic has led to the infection of at least seven people, Milwaukee health officials say.
According to officials, six voters and one poll worker have tested positive for COVID-19. They added that more cases could emerge in the coming days. It's also not known how many infections may have happened in other parts of the state.
Fears of the coronavirus caused drastic shortfalls in volunteers to be poll workers for the April 7 election. That, in turn, forced officials to reduce the number of polling sites. Milwaukee was one of the hardest-hit parts of the state, with the number of voting locations falling from 180 to five. That forced some voters to wait in line for hours if they wanted to cast a vote.
In the days before the election, critics had warned that holding the vote in person could aid the spread of the virus. Governor Tony Evers asked the legislature to delay the vote a week ahead of the election, but the Republican-controlled legislature concluded that there wasn't enough time to do so. A federal judge rejected efforts to delay the vote without approval from the legislature.
In Florida, at least two poll workers tested positive for the coronavirus after the state's March 17 election. Ohio is scheduled to hold a primary election on April 27, but the election will be conducted almost entirely by mail.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has pushed for federal legislation to promote mail-in voting for the November general election. But so far those proposals have been rejected by Republican leaders in Congress."

Narrator: COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The US has reported over 5,000 cases so far, with many states practicing social distancing to limit the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that COVID-19 is spread primarily through person-to-person contact, from something like a cough or a sneeze. But even if you're not in direct contact with someone who is contagious, you might still come in contact with the virus.
If someone coughs or sneezes into their hands or wipes their nose and then touches a surface, it could become contaminated. The CDC says this type of transmission ""has not been documented."" But experts say contaminated surfaces can still pose a risk. New research from the National Institutes of Health, Princeton University, and the University of California, Los Angeles, broke down how long the COVID-19 virus can survive on different surfaces. And while these results could be affected by temperature, humidity, UV light, and wind, it's a reminder of how easily the virus can spread.
Luckily, the virus isn't airborne. But it can linger in droplets on particles in the air. The study found that viruses could last up to three hours in droplets in the air. Maintaining a distance of six feet from other people can help avoid particles spread through a cough or a sneeze.
On copper surfaces, like a drawer handle, the virus can last up to four hours.
While researchers found that the virus can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, the CDC believes packages or mail are unlikely to transmit the virus.
COVID-19 appears to last the longest on plastic and stainless steel, two to three days. That's longer than the flu can live on surfaces, according to the CDC. Nonporous surfaces seem to allow the virus to survive longer. That could include things like doorknobs, bus and subway handrails, light switches, desks, and keyboards. We don't know how long the virus can live on a phone or a phone case, but researchers speculate that because it's a smooth, nonabsorbent surface, it's possible that the survivability would be similar to plastic.
There are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of exposure. Always avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and face, and wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you're not able to wash your hands, use hand sanitizer. You should also routinely clean commonly used surfaces, like doorknobs and your phone, with disinfecting wipes. And avoid nonessential travel to public places, especially at peak times."

Earlier this month, the FCC and FTC sent letters to three gateway providers that were facilitating COVID-19-related robocall scams. The FCC warned that if the providers did not cut off those robocalls, phone companies would begin blocking all traffic from those gateway providers’ networks. According to the FCC, the providers stopped carrying those scams within 24 hours. Now, the FCC wants feedback on whether a similar approach might be used for one-ring scam calls.
In the meantime, the FCC advises consumers not to answer or return calls from numbers they don’t recognize and to check whether unfamiliar numbers have international area codes. It even suggests asking your phone company to block outgoing international calls if you don’t typically place those."

Kim Shin-chang, director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group, told CNN Sunday that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak.
The coronavirus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected 3,526 people and killed 17 in South Korea. Health authorities say more than half of all cases are related to Shincheonji -- an offshoot of Christianity -- and a specific branch in the southern city of Daegu.
South Korea's Ministry of Justice last week said that 42 Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated, to South Korea since July.
Many of the cases in other countries came from people who had traveled to Wuhan, or had been in contact with someone who had -- meaning the 42 members could have brought back the virus if they were traveling during the peak of the outbreak.
Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan. He said that while the group didn't have official travel records for all its members, ""we have no record"" of any coming from Wuhan into South Korea since November.
He said the outbreak began in December -- so there was no need to check members' travel history from July.
""It makes me wonder if they are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji,"" he said. ""I would like to ask the Ministry of Justice why they did not check all Chinese and Korean citizens (traveling) from Wuhan since July, and why they only released the number of 42 (Shincheonji) members.""
The Ministry of Justice said it had pulled the immigration records from July on request of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment.
'We did our best in the situation'
After identifying and announcing the Shincheonji link on February 18, South Korean authorities raced to contain the spread of the virus, tracking down thousands of attendees to trace their contacts and symptoms. It took a week before the group gave a list of member's names to authorities.
About 600 Daegu police officers were deployed to knock on doors, track phones, and scour security camera footage to find them, as members often don't answer phone calls from nonmembers.
Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said Friday that the group had also omitted some members in a list of attendees submitted to city authorities, and that he would report the group to police for ""hampering the city's measures to contain the virus.""
Kim apologized ""to the Korean people for the worries we have caused"" -- but insisted Shincheonji had been fully transparent.
""We shut down all offices to prevent further spread, and our administrative process has become delayed as all members are working from home so they can self-isolate themselves to the fullest extent,"" he said.
""I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation.""
Kim also admitted members had been encouraged to deny being part of the group not to conceal any vital information or to hamper the coronavirus investigation, but because ""Shincheonji is perceived as a cult, and because of this many members are discriminated against.""
He dismissed other accusations too, like claims by former member Duhyen Kim that illness was never accepted as a valid reason to miss services.
In February, Duhyen Kim described to CNN how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services ""packed together like sardines."" He and several other former members described how attendees are not allowed to wear masks during prayer time, as it was seen as ""disrespectful to God.""
Such claims were outdated and inaccurate, said Kim Shin Chang, adding that since January, members with symptoms had been told not to come in, or to wear masks during service. 
""So there is no evidence that our service method is the reason we are seeing such an outbreak in our group,"" he said.
What is Shincheonji, and how did the virus spread?
Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984.
It was founded by Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a god-like figure within the group -- he is even believed to be ""the second coming of Jesus Christ,"" said Duhyen Kim.
The virus is believed to have spread through cases who attended a Shincheonji service or were in contact with attendees, authorities say.
Between January 31 and February 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral of the founder's brother, who had been hospitalized near the southern city of Daegu.Numerous confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths have since been recorded from the same hospital.
Then, on February 18, South Korea reported its 31st case -- a 61-year-old woman with no prior overseas travel history or contact with other confirmed cases.
A cluster of infections followed. By February 20, the national tally had increased from 31 to 156 and the first death was reported.
While tracing the movements of the 31st patient, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spotted a link between the new patients: case number 31 had attended a Shincheonji service with hundreds others in Daegu.
Once the link to the religious group was established, authorities sprang into action, quarantining attendees, disinfecting buildings, and closing down the group's services.
The group says it has about 245,000 members in total, with more than 31,000 from overseas. An internal document from 2017, called the ""International Missions Department status report,"" provided to CNN by former members, said the group has eight branches in the US, with the LA chapter being the largest with more than 1,000 members, as well as dozens of chapters in China."

Amazon is extending its increase in the hourly pay rate of warehouse workers through May 16th, according to a report from CNBC. The company originally announced in March that, as part of its hiring increase to contend with the huge surge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, it would raise warehouse worker pay by $2 an hour. 
The pay increase was temporary, slated to end by May 1st. Now, Amazon is extending the pay bump to help incentivize workers to continue staffing its warehouses and its grocery and package delivery platforms. 
We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community, an Amazon spokesperson tells CNBC. According to the report, Amazon is currently employing more than 250,000 fulfillment center workers across 110 facilities in the US alone. 
Despite these added benefits, Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its handling of health and safety issues during COVID-19. Employees have complained of warehouses remaining open despite workers testing positive for the virus, and Amazon has also been accused of failing to notify employees when they may have come into contact with co-workers who later test positive.
A warehouse worker strike in New York City last month drew national headlines after Amazon fired one of its organizers, claiming he was violating self-isolation guidelines. Leaked documents later revealed Amazon executives plans to smear the organizer, Chris Smalls, to discredit the growing labor movement within the company. 
Earlier this month, the first Amazon warehouse worker died of COVID-19, and since the Smalls incident, Amazon has fired both corporate employees and other warehouse workers for speaking out about the companys handling of safety issues during the pandemic. The National Labor Relations Board is now looking into whether Amazon is violating its employees rights. And today, Amazon tech workers are calling in sick to protest the companys actions.

A woman in Oregon and a high school boy in Washington state are presumptive positives, meaning the tests were conducted at local labs but the results have not yet been confirmed by the CDC. 
The other two mystery cases are out of California. 
An older woman in Santa Clara County who had been hospitalized for a respiratory illness tested positive for the virus but had no relevant travel history or contact with anyone infected, health officials said. 
""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission, but the extent is still not clear,"" said Dr. Sara Cody, director of the county's public health department.
Theother California case is a Solano County woman who is hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in serious condition. 
The two counties are about 90 miles apart. The Santa Clara patient had not traveled to Solano County, officials said.
With an increase in unknown origin cases and a change in testing guidelines across the country, CDC officials said they were hoping to have every state and local health department testing for the virus by the end of next week.
As of early Saturday, there were at least 67 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US -- the majority of which were repatriated passengers from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship. Worldwide, the virus has killed at least 2,922 -- including 2,835 people in China -- and there have been 85,055 confirmed cases.
Here's what else you need to know heading into the weekend:
States announce presumptive positives
Oregon Health Authority officials confirmed the state's first presumptive case Friday -- a Washington County resident with no history of related travel nor close contact with another confirmed case, the agency said in a news release.
""As such, public health officials are considering it a likely community-transmitted case, meaning that the origin of the infection is unknown,"" the release said. 
Officials said the patient is in isolation.
""We are awaiting confirmation of the test results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but at this time we are considering this a presumptive case,"" said State Epidemiologist and State Health Officer Dean Sidelinger in a statement.
Officials also haven't traced how a Washington state high school boy was infected. Those test results were presumptive positive.
The student, a Snohomish County resident, is doing well, said Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District.
The patient is one of two presumptive positive cases in the state. 
A woman from King County tested positive at the state's Public Health Laboratory and is in home isolation, according to a release from the Washington State Health Department. Her test is awaiting confirmation from the CDC.
She visited South Korea for about two weeks earlier this month, according to Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer at Public Health of Seattle &amp; King County. The woman returned and worked for one day before noticing symptoms. She developed a fever, cough, some nausea, a headache and a sore throat, Duchin said in a news conference Friday. Officials are now investigating the woman's workplace and anyone she may have come in contact with, he said. 
States are now conducting tests
Following a change in testing guidelines, the CDC is working to expand the number of labs who can test for the virus. 
Testing kits from the CDC arrived in California Friday and additional kits were expected soon, according to a press release from the California Department of Public Health.
""These new testing protocols and resources will help California medical experts identify and treat COVID-19 cases, trace potential exposures and better protect public health,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. 
But some testing kits initially sent to state and local labs were flawed, delaying their ability to test for the virus.
""This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday.
Guidelines for who should be tested were also broadened by the CDC earlier this week after the first case of unknown origin out of California. 
Initial guidance called for testing if a patient had a travel history to China or had been in close contact with someone who had been there, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.
The Solano County patient now in serious condition wasn't initially tested at UC Davis n
or the Northern California hospital she was transferred from because she did not fit the CDC criteria for testing at the time. 
""As soon as that case was recognized, we met and we revised our case definition for persons under investigation,"" Redfield said. The guidance was updated on the CDC's website Thursday. ""Today that has been posted along with a new health advisory that the recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus.""

Verily launched its Project Baseline COVID-19 screening site last week. Users who complete the screener and are told they're eligible for testing will be pointed to one of Verily's limited testing facilities, which are currently limited to San Jose, San Mateo, Lake Elsinore City, and Sacramento.
We can now see how these drive-thru facilities actually work, courtesy of a new video from the company.
First, participants roll up and present proof of identity and their appointment confirmation, before moving to a second station where they're handed a testing kit. They then move to another station where they must roll down the window and receive a nasal swab.
Samples are shipped to a lab for analysis, and Verily says those who take the test will get their results between 2 to 4 days. However, it warns that this could take longer due to an increasing number of tests going to the lab.
If participants test positive for the coronavirus, they'll receive a phone call from a qualified healthcare professional; if it's negative, they'll get an email.
As Verily continues to expand its testing facilities, concerns have been raised over how it's handling user data. Last week, five Democratic senators sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Vice President Mike Pence expressing concern that Verily was putting people's data at risk.
Verily told Business Insider that its data is stored separately from other Google products, and that it will delete all user data once the COVID-19 screening program has concluded, unless those users explicitly state otherwise. It does, however, share some user data with third parties including Salesforce to help its customer service team contact individuals.

However, pollution levels quickly rebounded, as seen in the dark red images from the same time last year.
This year has been another story, however. The virus story started to explode early in the New Year, after Chinese authorities had confirmed that the illness was caused by a new coronavirus similar to those that caused the SARS and MERS outbreaks. By January 23rd, the government had shut down all transportation into and out of Wuhan, while closing local businesses and factories in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
As a result, NASA's NO2 maps of the region during the same period in 2020 show very light levels of pollution (as blue, rather than yellow and red) on the maps. Another key indicator of pollution, ozone, shows a similar result, according to NASA. Liu said that the agency has mapped pollution drops around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, and in other nations around the 2007-2009 economic recession, but never to that level.
One of the great values of an airborne observatory is that scientists can assess pollution events and compare them to past periods. ""There is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,"" said NASA air quality scientist Barry Lefer, an air quality scientist at NASA. ""Our long-term OMI data allows us to see if these amounts are abnormal and why.""
This time, the decrease is more than a holiday-related dropoff compared to past events going back to 2005. Overall, NO2 values during the COVID-19 outbreak were from 10 to 30 percent lower than what is normally seen at this time of year.
While that provides some breathing relief for residents, the coronavirus has devastated the region, causing nearly 3,000 deaths so far in China. ""I am not surprised [about the pollution drop] because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize spread of the virus,"" said Liu."

Musk's tweets, which included the false gem that children are ""essentially immune,"" appear to be in violation of Twitter's new rules ostensibly aimed at stopping the spread of potentially dangerous COVID-19 misinformation. However, despite what common sense might suggest, it seems the disjointed and ill-informed musings of the entitled billionaire are in fact totally OK with the social media giant. 
A Twitter spokesperson confirmed as much Thursday afternoon in an email to Mashable: ""We reviewed the Tweets and they don't violate our rules,"" wrote the spokesperson. 
Notably, Musk's statement about the immunity of kids appears to contradict the Twitter rule prohibiting ""Claims that specific groups, nationalities are never susceptible to COVID-19[.]""
Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 19, 2020
It also reads a lot like an example, provided by Twitter, of prohibited content: ""COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven't seen any cases of children being sick.""
There have, of course, been observed cases of children becoming infected and even dying from COVID-19. 
Musk also suggested possible off-label treatments for COVID-19, positing that chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine might do the trick. And, despite what serial bullshitter Donald Trump claimed in a Thursday press conference, Bloomberg reports that ""An FDA spokesperson said the drug hadnt been approved for use in Covid-19 patients.""
Musk's tweets suggesting an unapproved treatment might possibly also violate a different coronavirus-specific rule on Twitter: ""Description of treatments or protective measures which are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective, are not applicable to the COVID-19 context.""
SEE ALSO: Working from home? Think twice about posting that desk pic.
Not so, however, according to Twitter. 
Musk appears to have gotten the message and has continued to tweet his way through the coronavirus pandemic at breakneck speed, insisting, among other things, that ""panic will cause more harm than the virus,"" and casually promising to manufacture much-needed ventilators (will they be submarine shaped?). Oh yeah, and just this afternoon he wrote that there will be ""probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April.""
Because, as the epitome of Silicon Valley hubris, Musk knows deep down inside that if he's knowledgable about one field, it makes him an expert in all unrelated ones, too. 
Anyway, regardless, Twitter appears cool with it all."

The United States reported 2,364 deaths on Tuesday, far above the previous daily high of 2,069 recorded on April 10, according to a Reuters tally. U.S. deaths on Wednesday stood at 29,751, up 1,305, with many states yet to report. Cases topped 615,000 in the United States and 2 million globally. 
Despite the spike in deaths, there were tentative signs in some parts of the country that the outbreak was beginning to ebb. 
Governors of about 20 states with few coronavirus cases believe they may be ready to start the process of reopening their economies by President Donald Trump’s May 1 target date, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday. 
Of the 50 U.S. states, 17 reported fewer than 100 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday. 
Governors in harder-hit states - New York, California, Louisiana, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Michigan - said there was a need for more widespread testing before starting to end America’s coronavirus shutdown, which has thrown millions out of work with the closing of restaurants, businesses and schools. 
Health officials have noted that death figures are a lagging indicator of the outbreak, coming after the most severely ill patients fall sick, and do not mean stay-at-home restrictions are failing to curb transmissions. 
New York state and some other hard-hit areas continue to report sharp decreases in hospitalizations and numbers of patients on ventilators, although front-line healthcare workers and resources remained under extraordinary stress. 
Officials have also cautioned that coronavirus-related death figures are likely an undercount due to people dying at home or in nursing homes who were never tested for the virus.

A total of 738 million people live on the African continent. Given its size and connections to China, scientists and global health campaigners fear there are many more infections that are not being reported. 
They also fear that Africa is not equipped to deal with a major health emergency. Nigeria's senate said on Thursday — hours before the first confirmed case — that the country was not prepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also described Africa's health systems as ""fragile.""
Dr Matshidiso Moeti, Africa director at the WHO, said on Tuesday that the ""window of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing.""
In a report published by The Lancet earlier this month, Michel Yao, the WHO's Africa program manager for emergency operations, also said: ""We all know how fragile health systems [are] in the African continent, they are already overwhelmed by many outbreaks.""
""For us, it is critical to detect coronavirus earlier [so] that we can prevent spreading within communities that can trigger a number of cases that can overwhelm the treatment capacity.""

Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and global health campaigner, also warned on Monday that the coronavirus could overwhelm health systems on the African continent.
""This disease, if it's in Africa ... it's more dramatic than if it's in China,"" Gates told the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Seattle.
Specifically, the impact in sub-Saharan Africa could be ""very, very dramatic,"" said Gates, who in 2018 had warned of a global pandemic.
The US' Rand Corporation found in 2016 that 22 out of the 25 countries most prone to infectious disease outbreaks were in Africa. 
The WHO is now deploying help and experts to 13 African countries that it thinks are the most vulnerable, based on their transport links to China, including Algeria.
As of Sunday, 26 African countries had the capacity to test people for the coronavirus, according to Agence France-Presse. That number is expected to rise to 40.

Another paper published The Lancet last week found that Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa were most at risk of importing the virus from China, followed by Nigeria and Ethiopia.
Given its response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Liberia could also struggle, Emily Ricotta, a research fellow at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Business Insider's Sarah Al-Arshani earlier this month.
One reason why Africa could suffer most from an outbreak is due to low levels of trust in healthcare systems.
According to The Washington Post, several studies in the continent show that many ""place greater confidence in traditional or religious leaders than government officials,"" meaning some people could chose not to seek medical help.

Google, its sister company Verily, and the US government are teaming up to create two separate information and screening websites for COVID-19. The websites were clumsily announced over the weekend by President Donald Trump and Google public relations, and today the first website, a Verily-developed site for the Bay Area, has gone live.
The announcement of the site was very disorganized and confusing. Normally we would expect Google and the government to have a simultaneous announcement for a project like this, but Google PR seemed to be caught by surprise by Trump's Rose Garden press conference and took two hours to respond to the news on Twitter. When Google did respond to the president's announcement, it disputed the description of a ""nationwide"" site, saying the site was in the ""early stages of development"" and that the site would roll out in the Bay Area for testing. A day later, Google communications took a second swing at making a statement, indicating that, actually, two sites were being made by the Alphabet family, one nationwide and one for the Bay Area.
In its second statement, Google communications said that Google, not Verily, would be ""partnering with the US government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk, and testing information."" Google said that this nationwide site was ""In addition to... work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area."" A report from The New York Times indicates that this effort is just as improvised behind the scenes as it seems from the outside: the Times reports that Google only started recruiting employees for its project the day before Trump's announcement, and as of Wednesday, Verily's site was described internally by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai as ""a planning effort.""
Somehow, Verily launched a website this morning, and for all the hype and promises that were made, the site in its current incarnation doesn't provide any useful information or services. The site's ""Get started"" button leads to a simple three-question multiple-choice survey that seems like it is meant to lead to some actual screening or medical info, but right now, it seems to turn everyone away no matter how the questions are answered.
The first question is ""Are you currently experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms?"" and if you say ""yes,"" indicating that you are very sick, the site actually ends the survey and suggests you seek medical attention. If you say ""No"" to the severe cough question, the survey continues, asking if you are 18 or older, and if you are within 50 miles of the two California testing sites. Answering in the affirmative to both of those questions got us ""Unfortunately, we are unable to schedule more appointments at this time. Appointments will continue to expand through this program as we scale capacity in the near future."" So no matter how you answer, you are turned away by the survey.
These three questions seem to be the extent of Verily's site. It is extremely simple and limited. The site seems like something anyone could whip up in Google Forms in a few minutes.
Verily says its COVID-19 site is ""a collaboration between Verily's Project Baseline and the state of California to expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing in areas with a high volume of known cases."" The program is focused on ""Helping those with concerns about COVID-19 to possibly get tested free of cost"" and ""Enabling public health officials to target testing efforts."" The program doesn't seem like it can do any of that in its current incarnation, and the site says ""We are working to rapidly expand testing in every way that we can; please check back soon as we add more testing sites and may expand eligibility criteria.""We were never asked to use a Google account to take the survey, but according to the site, a Google account will be required at some point, which has alarmed privacy advocates. Verily says it requires a Google account to ""enable us to collect your answers to the screening survey, contact you to schedule testing, and deliver results back to you."" But it seems like a simple email address would have served this purpose, too, without forcing people to be tracked through a Google account.
Verily's FAQ says it ""will not share any information with your insurance or medical providers without your consent,"" but it also says ""The information you provide may also be shared with the health care professionals who collect your specimen, the clinical laboratory that processes your specimen, the California Department of Public Health, and potentially other federal, state, and local health authorities, and other entities that assist with the testing program. Information may also be shared with certain service providers engaged to perform services on behalf of Verily, including Google, which Verily leverages for certain technology and services, including cloud services, security services, data storage, website hosting, and other support functions.""
So far, there's still no word on when a nationwide screening site will launch.

As the United States continues to struggle to ramp up basic testing for COVID-19, experts at the World Health Organization on Monday emphasized that countries should prioritize such testingand that social-distancing measures are not enough.
We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (aka Dr. Tedros) said in a press briefing March 16.
Dr. Tedros noted that, as the numbers of cases and deaths outside of China have quickly risen, many countriesincluding the UShave urgently adopted so-called social-distancing measures, such as shuttering schools, canceling events, and having people work from home. While these measures can slow transmission and allow health care systems to better cope, they are not enough to extinguish this pandemic, Dr. Tedros warned.
Whats needed is a comprehensive approach, he said. But we have not seen an urgent-enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response, Dr. Tedros said.
The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission, he went on. And to do that, you must test and isolate. You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we dont know who is infected.
The message was a sharp one for the United States, which has struggled to ramp up its testing capacity. While other countries have performed hundreds of thousands of tests since the outbreak mushroomed out of Chinas Hubei province in January, some estimates suggest that the US has tested a mere 38,000 people or soa majority in just the last couple of weeks. In contrast, South Korea has been testing nearly 20,000 people every day.
In a series of press conferences in recent days, members of the Trump administrations Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, have announced plans to dramatically increase the countrys testing capacity, including partnerships with private companies. The officials have suggested that the country will soon be able to tests tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people per week.
But confidence in the plans have been shaken by clumsy descriptions and overstatements. That includes an announcement Friday by President Trump that Google was developing a website that would allow people nationwide to determine if they should get tested and help them set up testing at a local lab. The announcement reportedly took Google by surprise. Its sister company, Verily, has since released such a site, but it only serves people in Californias Bay Area, and, so far, doesnt provide any useful information or services.Additionally, while experts at the WHO recommend thorough testing of suspected cases and contacts to get ahead of transmission, the Trump administration has so far emphasized mainly testing people with noticeable symptoms who largely self-identify as candidates for being tested. Officials also said testing would be prioritized for health care workers and those 65 years and older who had symptoms.
We dont want everybody taking this test. Its totally unnecessary, President Trump said in a press briefing Friday.
So far, the US has detected over 4,200 cases in 49 states and the District of Columbia. This number is expected to be far lower than the actual number of cases due to the delayed and limited testing. There have been 74 reported deaths in the US.
Worldwide, there are over 181,000 cases in at least 148 countries. More than 7,000 people have died."

In all of the grim statistics of COVID-19s devastation, one seemingly bright spot has been that children seem to be largely unaffected. They consistently make up small percentages of confirmed cases and nearly all have a mild form of the disease. But, as more data accumulates, were getting a clearer picture of what COVID-19 looks like in childrenand when its youngest victims are not spared from the worst.
On Monday, April 6, public health researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the first data set on pediatric COVID-19 cases in the United States. The report looked at more than 2,500 cases in infants, children, and adolescents under age 18, collectively referred to as children in the study. The data was published in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
The data largely echoes that of pediatric cases seen in China and elsewhere. Children made up a sliver of COVID-19 cases overall and their symptoms appeared largely mild.
The CDC researchers found the 2,572 pediatric cases among 149,082 cases in total. That is, pediatric cases made up just 1.7 percent of the cases examined. This is a significant underrepresentation of that age group in the US. Children under 18 make up 22 percent of the countrys population.
Of the 2,752 pediatric cases, nearly 60 percent were in children aged 10 to 17. Youngsters under 1 year, those aged 1 to 4, and 5 to 9, made up 15 percent, 11 percent, and 15 percent of the cases, respectively. Among 2,490 cases with sex information, 57 percent were male.
The data also suggested that the cases were largely mild, though they only had data on symptoms from 291 of the 2,572 pediatric cases. Of those 291 cases, 78 (27 percent) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath (the most common symptoms in adults). And of those 78 cases, 53 didnt report any symptoms. That said, researchers could not dub these cases asymptomatic because it was unclear if all of their potential symptoms had been recorded. One case was reported as asymptomatic.
Patchy data
The researchers had data on hospitalization status for just 745 cases. Of those, 147 were hospitalized. Thats nearly 20 percent of the cases that had data on hospitalization, but only about 6 percent of the overall 2, 572 pediatric cases. With the limited data, the CDC researchers reported the hospitalization rate in children as that range (6 to 20 percent). Of those hospitalized cases, 15 were admitted to intensive care, giving a range of 0.58 to 2 percent.
These figures are significantly lower than what was seen in the adult cases gathered in the study, which had hospitalization rates ranging from 10 to 30 percent, and ICU admission from about 1 to 4.5 percent.
The children who fared the worst were the youngest and those with underlying health conditionsas has been seen in other pediatric and adult data.
Though researchers only had hospitalization status data on 95 infants under 1 year old, 59 of those infants were hospitalized. Thats 62 percent of infants with known hospitalization data and 15 percent of all the infants under age 1 in the analysis. Thats a much wider range than the hospitalization rate of 1 to 17-year-olds, which spanned 4.1 to 14 percent.
<ul><li>

</li><li>
 Symptoms in pediatric cases. 
</li></ul>
Additionally, the researchers had information about underlying health conditions for 345 of the pediatric cases. Eighty of the cases (23 percent with data) had at least 1 underlying health condition, with chronic lung conditions (including asthma) being the most common, followed by cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression.
There were 295 cases with both hospitalization status and information about underlying health. Of those, there were 37 hospitalized (including six that were admitted to an ICU) and 28 of them (77 percent) had an underlying health conditionand that included all six in the ICU.
The data is in line with that from 2,143 pediatric cases in China, which was first published last month in the journal Pediatrics. The researchers overall found that most of the cases in children were mild, with about 5 percent of cases being considered severe and under 1 percent considered critical.
Similarities
But again, the youngest appeared the most at risk of severe disease. In the 2,143 pediatric cases, infants under 1 and those 1 to 5 accounted for 60 percent of severe cases. And those youngest age groups accounted for nearly 70 percent of critical cases, with under 1-year-olds making up 54 percent of all pediatric critical cases.
Among the 379 infants under 1 year, 33 had severe disease (about 9 percent) and seven were critical (just under 2 percent). Of 493 children aged 1 to 5, 34 of them (about 7 percent) had severe cases and two (0.4 percent) had critical cases. The study reported one death in a 14-year-old boy.
Hospitalization rates in pediatric COVID-19 cases, grouped by age
The CDC researchers in their data reported three deaths in children, but declined to provide Ars with data on their ages, citing privacy concerns with such few cases. The researchers also note in the study that investigations are ongoing to determine if COVID-19 was the cause of death or if underlying health issues played roles.
Both studies have significant limitations. The new CDC study on US pediatric cases is severely hampered by holes in the data, including case information on hospitalization status, underlying health conditions, and some outcomes. Also, 1,827 of the 2,572 cases were from the New York-New Jersey region, which has been the epicenter of the countrys outbreak. It is unclear if case demographic trends, testing criteria, case severity, and outcomes will match other areas with different populations and, perhaps, less burdened healthcare systems.
In the Chinese data, researchers also lacked data, most notably information about underlying health conditions. They also included both laboratory-confirmed cases (34 percent) and suspected cases (66 percent) based on clinical symptoms. The latter leaves open the possibility that some of the cases were not from COVID-19 but some other respiratory infection. Notably, more than seventy percent of the cases in children under 1 and aged 1 to 5 were suspected, not confirmed cases. This age group is plagued by many serious respiratory infections, including RSV.
Still, despite all the limitations, it is clear that children are not universally spared from the worst outcomes of COVID-19. Suspected cases in children should be monitored closely, particularly in infants and children with underlying conditions, the CDC researchers conclude. And, because we dont know what role children may play in transmission of COVID-19, theylike everyoneshould adhere to strict social distancing and other hygienic measures during this crisis."

Testing is one of the most important tools for getting the coronavirus pandemic under control in the United States. More than 160,000 COVID-19 tests were performed in the US on Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But there's good reason to believe that there are still many people with the virus who have not been tested. More testing would help guide treatment and quarantine decisions and give government officials more data about the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak.
At the same time, a Nature investigation has revealed that a number of academic labs capable of performing COVID-19 tests are operating well below capacity. Nature's reporting suggests that incompatible IT systems are significant reasons for this mismatch.
Many hospitals are used to working with large commercial labs that have the software necessary to interface with a hospital's electronic health records and billing systems. When an academic lab shows up with the capacity to run tests but not the infrastructure to interface with hospital systems, hospitals are often reluctant to do business with them.
Nature talked to Fyodor Urnov, who directs a genomics center at the University of California, Berkeley. The organization launched a testing service in late March and began pitching it to hospitals. His lab already has the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification that is required to perform COVID-19 tests.
The tests would have been free to hospitals, funded by private philanthropists. But he still had trouble finding hospitals interested in working with him.
""The business of American medicine and the way it is organized is astonishingly unprepared for this,"" he told Nature. ""I show up in a magic ship, with 20,000 free kits and CLIA and everything, and the major hospitals say: Go away, we cannot interface with you.
Urnov's lab wound up testing some patients outside the hospital systemincluding firefighters and homeless people. The non-profit group coordinating these tests doesn't have software compatible with the Berkeley testing service's software, but folks on both sides were willing to do manual data entry to accelerate the testing process.
Stacey Gabriel, a human geneticist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, told Nature that ""our capacity is 2,000 tests a day, but we arent doing that many. Yesterday was around 1,000.""
Like Urnov's group, Gabriel's project has had to hustle to find partners willing to be flexible enough to try a service that didn't have the full infrastructure of a commercial testing lab. It took about 2,000 phone calls and many e-mails, but were getting there, Gabriel told Nature.
But she worries that logistical difficulties like this could prevent other labs from joining the testing effort."

Johns Hopkins University on Monday, April 13, released a new version of its wildly popular COVID-19 dashboard that focuses solely on the United States and includes rich, county-level data and infographics not seen in the global version.
While the initial landing page looks much like the global version, clicking through to the county-specific infographics adds extensive context to each locations situation. Each countys cases, deaths, and fatality rate are displayed alongside state-level data on testing, cases, deaths, and the fatality rate.
The infographic also contains critical information on county-level healthcare resources, including staffed hospital beds and ICU beds, as well as mitigation policies that have been put in place.
Last, the pandemic data is put in context to the areas demographics, including a bar graph showing the health insurance status of residents by age group. Theres also basic data on the local populations size, race, and ethnicity breakdown; poverty status; and the number of people over age 65.
Back on the landing page, viewers can see countrywide trends with color-coded county-level data on confirmed cases, confirmed cases by population, deaths, and fatality rate.
In addition the new, standalone dashboard for the United States, JHU also announced that it has made improvements to the original global version. It added state-level US testing, hospitalization rates, and case curves to the global map. Its also adding global incidence and mortality rates.
Johns Hopkins goal is to make this data as publicly and widely available as possible, the university said in a press release.
The global dashboard, originally released in January, has become wildly popular amid the pandemic. It is used the world over by members of the public as well as by policymakers and public health researchers. According to a recent report in Nature Index, the site was built by a graduate student in just a few hours after a spur-of-the-moment decision. It has now been getting more than a billion hits per day."

 and stolen masks
 to phishing attempts
 designed to take advantage of the pandemic, the internet has seen coronavirus-related scams and attacks skyrocket over the past few weeks.
Now, Google is sharing what its team of security experts have uncovered.
Googles Threat Analysis Group (TAG) released a report on Wednesday detailing a number of COVID-19 attacks seen across the company's product line.  
The search giant says it has specifically identified attacks targeting U.S. governmental workers and health agencies, phishing emails going after employees working from home, and fake charity solicitations.
Hackers frequently look at crises as an opportunity, and COVID-19 is no different, writes Shane Huntley of Googles Threat Analysis Group in the report. Across Google products, were seeing bad actors use COVID-related themes to create urgency so that people respond to phishing attacks and scams. 
Furthermore, these attacks are not just being carried out by lone hackers looking to cause trouble or scammers out for a cash grab. According to Googles security team, it found more than a dozen state-sponsored hacking groups using the coronavirus as a lure when targeting users in its phishing and malware attempts.
The security team discovered a coronavirus-themed attack campaign targeting international health organizations and officials. The attacks spoofed the World Health Organizations login pages in an effort to steal its targets' credentials.
According to Google, these attacks mirrored those previously reported
 on earlier this month by the hacker group Charming Kitten, which has links to the Iranian government. The report also names a malicious South American actor known as ""Packrat"" as another source of these attacks.

The company shared screenshots of emails from hackers pretending to be from the World Health Organization (WHO). One particular message tried to trick its recipient into downloading malware.
Google detailed another notable government-backed attack targeting U.S. government workers. A phishing campaign disguised as American fast food franchises went after these employees, pretending to offer them coupons and free meals in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Other emails pretended to be these food establishments online ordering service. The purpose of these emails was to get targets to click through to a page that looked like the fast food companys, but was in fact set up by the attacker to steal their Google account login credentials.
According to Google, the vast majority of these messages were marked as spam upon receipt and never seen by its users.
Were not aware of any user having their account compromised by this campaign, but as usual, we notify all targeted users with a 'government-backed attacker' warning, said Huntley.
The search giant previously reported
 last week that its systems had detected 18 million coronavirus-related malware and phishing messages in Gmail each day. It also shared that there were more than 240 million COVID-19-themed spam messages sent daily. The company said that its been able to block 99.9 percent of those attacks and spam messages from reaching its intended targets. 
One interesting point of data from Googles report is that phishing attacks by government-backed actors actually declined over the past month as compared to January and February of this year. While the attacks related to the coronavirus received a boost, overall theyre down.
And the search engine has a theory on why that is the case.
While its not unusual to see some fluctuations in these numbers, it could be that attackers, just like many other organizations, are experiencing productivity lags and issues due to global lockdowns and quarantine efforts, explained Googles Huntley.

That's the advice of investors bidding up Netflix shares and looking at food delivery and gaming stocks.
Goldman's chief US equity strategist David Kostin means something slightly different. He says highly US-focused companies are the smart bet for investors who are seeking protection today.
""Global economic growth is slowing but the US is better positioned than other regions,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Firms with high US sales will outperform companies with high foreign sales.""
He continued: ""The reasons are familiar, as he cites low US unemployment, high consumer confidence, growing wages, and reduced household debt levels.""
This chart shows the trend already in place, with more internationally-focused stocks falling behind their US-focused peers as the outbreak has played out — and stocks with greater sales exposure to China suffering bigger losses.
Companies with more international exposure are falling behind more US-focused stocks, and Goldman Sachs says the trend will get worse.

The spreading COVID-19 epidemic knocked the S&amp;P 500 into a shockingly fast correction — or drop of more than 10% — after it set a record high as recently as February 19. That reflects the economic questions that have arisen as the epidemic has spread. As of Thursday, more than 82,000 people have been infected and 2,800 have died.
While Kostin thinks the epidemic will wipe out profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies this year, he says companies that make the bulk of their sales in the US will be relatively safe from that damage. He adds that because of the strength of the US economy, those companies have faster estimated sales growth.
Here are 15 stocks that fit Kostin's criteria because they make an overwhelming majority of their sales domestically. Many are entirely US-based. They've each outperformed the market as of Wednesday's closing price as well, and they're ranked from lowest to highest based on the stocks' performance so far this year."

That's because this virus leapt from animals and began infecting people just some five months ago. It's brand new, as far as pathogens go. This means big, weighty questions about immunity, the number of infections, and potential treatments still loom large.

Both Apple and Google have begun cracking down on apps related to the coronavirus, according to a new report from CNBC. App developers who spoke with the news organization say Apple is rejecting any and all coronavirus-related mobile software not from recognized health organizations or the government. CNBC also reports that Google is not returning any results for coronavirus-related searches on the Play Store, although its unclear at this time if Google is restricting the approval of new apps, too. 
Apple appears to be catching new coronavirus-related apps in its manual review process, with one developer telling CNBC they received a message from the iPhone maker reading, Apps with information about current medical information need to be submitted by a recognized institution. 
Apple and Google are taking measures to prevent misleading coronavirus apps
Some well-meaning mobile apps from independent developers that rely on World Health Organization data and information form recognized health institutions are getting caught up in the ban, CNBC reports. Thats because Apple is apparently evaluating whether apps that provide information related to the coronavirus can be trusted sources of information for the public, CNBC says. In this case, it would seem Apple is restricting those trusted sources to only official health organizations and the government. Apple declined to comment for this story. 
Right now, few iOS apps related to the virus are appearing in search results or in top app rankings, CNBC reports, although there are existing and mostly benign options available. Those include a virus tracker app from a company called Healthlynked, a COVID-19 (the illness caused by the novel coronavirus) app from medical resource company Unbound, and a Portuguese-language app published by the Brazilian government with information about the virus. 
As for Android, Google appears to be deliberately blocking search results for the virus and COVID-19, yet we dont know if the company has an outright ban on new apps related to the coronavirus. Google does, as CNBC points out, have existing policies against apps that deny the existence of major tragic effects; apps that lack reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic event[s]; and apps that appear to profit from a tragic event with no discernible benefit to the victims. 
Google declined to comment for this story, but the company did point The Verge to a series of approved apps providing coronavirus information, including ones from the American Red Cross, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Doctor On Demand, as well as news apps like the official Twitter Android app and News 360. Apps that are found to be in violation of its sensitive events policy, outlined above, can be removed as well, so it doesnt just apply to yet-to-be-published apps still in review. 
Apple and Google are far from the only companies taking measures to cut down on content that either peddles misinformation or seeks to take exploit the ongoing outbreak for financial gain. Facebook, the companys Instagram subsidiary, and Twitter have instituted bans on coronavirus misinformation, and Amazon is currently grappling with waves of new product listings that are exploiting the situation by either claiming to provide cures or protection against COVID-19 or price gouging health items like hand sanitizer and face masks. 
Etsy has begun cracking down on coronavirus listings on its marketplace, and Google has followed Facebook in banning coronavirus-related ads, although offenders are still slipping through the cracks.

The US National Institutes of Health on Thursday began a clinical trial to treat adult COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that President Trump has repeatedly promoted during the pandemic despite a lack of evidence for its effectiveness against the new coronavirus.
 The trial is one of dozens underway to test the drug, which is currently used to treat malaria and rheumatoid conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. At this point it only has mixed, anecdotal evidence to support its use against COVID-19.But that hasnt stopped President Trump from repeatedly promoting it as a promising treatment and calling for its use. In tweets last month, Trump said that a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. He followed the declaration saying he hoped they will be put in use IMMEDIATELY.
In a press conference Saturday, April 4, Trump continued: Ill say it again: What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it I think people shouldif it were mein fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it. OK? I may take it. And Ill have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it.
There is no clear evidence that hydroxychloroquineand the closely related drug chloroquineare effective at treating COVID-19. But there is clear evidence on risks of the drugs, which include everything from headaches, vomiting, and rashes to loss of vision (retinopathy), seizures, hypoglycemia, heart arrhythmias, and deadly heart damage. They may also pose more risks in patients with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and liver disease.
Data dive
Its also unclear how hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might hypothetically help fight off a COVID-19 infection. Early experiments with both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suggested the drugs blocked the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2from infecting monkey cells grown in petri dishes. The data hints at anti-viral activity, but such data is extremely preliminary in determining whether a drug would be effective against a virus infecting a whole human.
Theres also hope that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could be useful at dampening out-of-control immune responses. In some critically ill patients with COVID-19, berserk immune responses are thought to cause devastating damage to lungs and other organs. And theres some reason to think that the drugs could help with this, given their immune-quenching effects seen in patients with rheumatoid conditions, which are marked by inflammation. Some studies have suggested that the drugs work by thwarting the actions of certain receptors on human cells that trigger cascades of pro-inflammatory responses. But its still not entirely clear how exactly the drugs interact with the immune systemor whether it would be relevant to treating COVID-19.
The potential usefulness of these drugs against COVID-19 is now under investigation in numerous clinical trials, including the NIHs trial that is up and running as of this week.
The NIHs trial is a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled experiment aiming to enroll 500 adult patients with COVID-19 who have been hospitalized or are receiving emergency care and are expected to be admitted to a hospital. Researchers will give people randomized to the treatment group two doses of hydroxychloroquine per day for five days. Theyll then track the patients outcomes, looking at hospitalization status moving forward, need for oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation, and death.
The first patients were enrolled this week at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. It is one of dozens of medical centers in a network organized by the NIHs National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
Given the unbridled excitement surrounding hydroxychloroquinebolstered by President Trumpthe researchers involved in the trial feel the pressure to get results as quickly as possible.
Many US hospitals are currently using hydroxychloroquine as first-line therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 despite extremely limited clinical data supporting its effectiveness, Dr. Wesley Self, an emergency medicine physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center whos leading the trial, said in a statement. Thus, data on hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 are urgently needed to inform clinical practice.
Overselling
Amid Trumps push for hydroxychloroquine, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization late last month that allows doctors to treat patients with COVID-19. The unusual move spurred extensive backlash from former FDA officials, as reported by Science magazine.
Moreover, Trumps enthusiasm for the drug also reportedly led him to push the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the issue. The agency subsequently published an unprecedented guidance informing doctors how to prescribe chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, based on anecdotal data.
With widespread use comes widespread risks of side effects, according to Dr. Peter Lurie, a physician and former FDA executive under Obama and Trump, who spoke with Science. What is quite certain: When you get large numbers of people exposed to [hydroxychloroquine], there will be important adverse effects. That can be acceptable in the setting of known benefits, but its more difficult to accept when there isnt now and might never be evidence of benefit he said. Lurie now heads the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.Experts also worry that the availability of the drugs could undermine clinical trials trying to get that evidence. Availability of the drug could perhaps discourage patients from wanting to participate in trials in which they may be randomly assigned to get a placebo instead of what they may see as a promising treatment thats already accessible.
Moreover, theres growing concern that the surge in interest in these drugs are causing life-threatening shortages for patients with rheumatoid conditions, such as lupus, who rely on them for proven benefits.
Correcting course
Along with all the concern, backlash and pushback have been mounting. In a March 31 opinion piece, researchers urged their colleagues to protect patients with rheumatoid conditions and avoid misusing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. They added, Public figures should refrain from promoting unproven therapies to the public and instead provide clear messages around the uncertainties we face in testing and using experimental treatments during the current pandemic, including the risk for serious adverse events.""
Earlier this week, Reuters reported that the CDC removed the unusual guidance for physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The CDC website now correctly states, There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Likewise, criticism has continued to build against a very small, flawed French trial that claimed to provide evidence that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin could treat COVID-19a trial promoted by Trump. Among other problems, the trial jettisoned data on participants who got worse on the treatment, including three admitted to intensive care, one who stopped the trial due to adverse effects, and one who died.
In an initial statement April 3, the medical society behind the journal that published the study said that the society shares concerns about the article, which does not meet the Societys expected standard. The society later updated the statement to note that the study is going through additional review and raised the possibility that it might retract the study altogether after the review was complete.
Meanwhile, the NIH trial and dozens of others are trying to get solid data on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19. Among them is an international trial orchestrated by the World Health Organization, called the Solidarity trial, to test the drugs, as well as three other candidate treatments."

 As I'm based in DC, I tend to go to the cars and coffee events at Katie's Coffee House in Great Falls, Virginia. In 2015, I got to take this Audi R8 V10+ alongyou can check out the review here. 
</li><li>
 You never know exactly what you're going to see, and you need to get there early to get a good parking spot. Otherwise you might have to park next to a dumpster like this poor Stanley Steamer. 
</li><li>
</li><li>
 I'm humming the theme to The Prisoner. Are you humming the theme to The Prisoner too? 
The first car I truly lusted after, and I've still never driven one. 
</li><li>
 I don't know if this is the Subaru turbo-engined replica that lives in the area. I'm pretty sure it's not a real 550 Spyder, but if it is, I'm sure someone will let me know in the comments. 
</li><li>
 This is definitely a replica Ford GT40, but that doesn't make it any less cool. You'll note this is the second car with its engine exposedthat's a thing you do at cars and coffee. 
</li><li>
 Oh hello there, messers Gurney and Weslake. 
</li><li>
 You rarely see exotic cars driving around in the DC area, despite the extremely wealthy suburbs that surround us. But sometimes they turn out for cars and coffee. 
</li><li>
 In 2015 we also tested a McLaren 650S. I can still remember the pre-dawn drive to Great Falls with the roof down on an empty GW Parkway vividly. Gosh, I miss that car. 
</li><li>
 One freezing December morning, there was a Ferrari F40. But it was parked next to something that got even more attention. 
</li><li>
 This red Mosler is a Canadian supercar designed for GT racing. Except almost all the GT racing series banned it from competing. Anyway, you don't see them very often. 
</li><li>
 It's not all supercars at cars and coffee. in fact, it's mostly not supercars. This BMW driver takes the aerodynamics of his wing mirrors extremely seriously. 
</li><li>
 OK, there are still supercars.

The Petersen Museum in LA, like many museums these days, has shut its physical doors and moved online to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. For the past eight years, the museum has also been the host of a weekly ""Cars and Coffee"" meetup on Saturday mornings, and it's not about to let a bit of social distancing get in the way of that community-building. So it's moving cars and coffee online, too, opening up the event beyond the normal catchment area of people who can drive to Wilshire Boulevard early on a weekend morning. All you need is your car and a phone that can record video.
""Our Breakfast Club Cruise-Ins have become an integral part of the Los Angeles car community over the past eight years. We didn't want to stop the tradition this month because of the pandemic, so we had to get creative to keep it going and also make it more inclusive than ever before. We look forward to seeing the stories from enthusiasts all over the globe and sharing their passion in a way that unites us all in spirit even while we are standing apart,"" said Petersen Executive Director Terry Karges.
The idea is pretty simple. You need to record a 20-30 second video of your car; the inside, the outside, the engine, then start it upthe usual stuff you see at Cars and Coffee. Here's an important bit: the videos have to be in landscape orientation. Then host the video (on Dropbox, Googledrive, or YouTube), and submit that link to the Petersen via its website. They'll do the hard work of editing everyone's submissions together, and the first 90-minute compilation will be published on the museum's YouTube channel on April 26 (so submit yours by 10am PST on April 24 if you want to take part in the premiere). The Petersen will also hand out awards, including a people's choice award that you can vote for once the video goes live. Everyone is responsible for getting their own coffee, however.
It's a fun idea, and it's easy enough to do from the comfort of one's own driveway or in splendid isolation (although if you're going to film inside a garage, make sure the garage door is open before you start any engines, please).
As I'm carless these days, I won't be able to take part, but I raided my phone for some of the highlights (and lowlights) of the DC area cars and coffee meets in the gallery above to get you in the mood. And if you want to share supercars, stupid cars, or other weirdness you've seen at your local cars and coffee meets over the years, please post them in the comment thread.

One week after Tesla said it would keep up normal operations at the Gigafactory in Nevada, the company now plans to scale back the workforce there by more than 75 percent as the state shelters in place to fight the novel coronavirus. Panasonic, which helps make Teslas batteries in a section of the Gigafactory, suspended its operations there last week. Legacy automakers have also halted manufacturing operations in the United States amid the pandemic.
Tesla has already paused some nonessential operations at the factory and is encouraging employees to work from home if possible, which has significantly reduced the number of people showing up to work every day, according to an email obtained by the Reno Gazette-Journal. The company expects to be down to only essential supply chain work by next week, as well as roles like security, facility maintenance, limited critical production, and IT support. 
Its not clear if the workers are being paid while on leave
Its unclear if the Gigafactory workers who are being told to stay home are being offered paid or unpaid leave. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The company is paying the hourly employees at its other factories during similar shutdowns, though it also recently made its first pandemic-induced workforce cut in Norway. 
Tesla is taking a number of steps to reduce the chance of spreading the novel coronavirus among the employees who will keep coming into work, according to the email. The company will close some entrances and will perform temperature checks at the entrances that remain open. Hand sanitizer will be required upon entry. Workers will have to stay six feet apart, including in the cafeteria, where the company will only have one chair per table. Work stations will be disinfected twice per shift, too. 
On Thursday, Tesla confirmed two office employees had tested positive for COVID-19, but did not specify where those workers were located. The company said in an internal email that the employees had been working from home for nearly two weeks before they tested positive for COVID-19. 
News of the partial shutdown of the Gigafactory was first announced by the local county manager, Austin Osborne, in a post on the local governments website late Thursday.
Our companies at TRIC [the industrial park where Tesla operates] are taking the COVID-19 matter seriously, and regularly report to us the measures they are taking to adhere to the established guidelines while maintaining essential operations, Osborne wrote. Checking employee temperatures, creating central access, allowing remote work, maintaining workstation distance, and others are occurring. Osborne declined to offer more information in a follow-up email. 
Tesla announced on March 19th that it was shutting down its electric car factory in California and its solar panel factory in New York. The shutdown in California came almost a full week after local authorities had implemented a shelter-in-place order that forced nonessential businesses to close. Tesla also briefly shut down its newest Gigafactory in China earlier this year, though production there is back up and running.

The new coronavirus doesnt just kill by storming lungs and other organs. It also kills by besieging health care systems.
If left to swirl in a community unchecked for a few weeks, the virus can whip up a tsunami of cases that crash into urgent care clinics, emergency departments, and intensive care units, quickly washing out beds, supplies, and staff.
In such a crisis, doctors must make heart-wrenching decisions about which patients get the last beds and which get scarce ventilators and respiratory therapists. At the same time, theyre likely facing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks and gowns. Rationing and reusing such items leads to more nurses and doctors getting sick. That means fewer health care workers to wade through the flood of patients. Some may even join their patients in needing critical care.
Meanwhile, the normal stream of patients needing emergency care for accidents, heart attacks, strokes, and other conditions may be lost in the deluge.
Just a few months ago, this scenario may have seemed unthinkable in countries with modern health care systems. But it has been a consistent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Reports include patients going from hospital to hospital to try to get treatment in Wuhan, Chinawhere the outbreak beganto instances of patients in South Korea dying at home while waiting for a bed to open up in a hospital.
In hard-hit Italy, doctors report having to ration care and make difficult decisions about who among the critically ill to intubate. In Spain, patients are dying in waiting rooms.
In New York City, which has detected more than 21,800 cases and 281 deaths, doctors are already sounding the alarm of an overwhelming surge in cases. One doctor at a hospital in Queens described the situation as apocalyptic. The report noted that a refrigerator truck had been stationed outside the hospital to hold the bodies of the dead.
According to a briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and obtained by The New York Times, the citys 1,800 intensive care beds will be full by March 27.
Grim reality
This could happen anywhere. In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine, a group of medical ethicists and public health researchers made a series of conservative estimates, starting with the estimate that about 5 percent of the US populationabout 16 millionwill become infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the next three months. From there, about 8 percent of those cases may need to be hospitalized. Thats 1.28 million hospital beds. Of those, 960,000 may need to be admitted to an ICU.
According to the American Hospital Association, there are just under 800,000 staffed beds in community hospitals. Estimates of the countrys ICU beds for adult patients range from just 68,000 to 85,000.
Ultimately, how the pandemic plays out in the United States generally and in specific areas is difficult to predict. Social distancing and other interventions could lessen the blow.
But, given the rapidly rising case counts in some place, it is likely that at least some US doctors will soon face difficult choices, much like their counterparts abroad. Some of those choices will be extremely psychologically traumatic, the NEJM article authors write.
The choice to set limits on access to treatment is not a discretionary decision, but a necessary response to the overwhelming effects of a pandemic, they write. The question is not whether to set priorities, but how to do so ethically and consistently, rather than basing decisions on individual institutions approaches or a clinicians intuition in the heat of the moment.
So, in an overwhelming pandemic, how should doctors decide whom to save?
The authors lay out six recommendations, guided by four fundamental values: maximizing benefits, treating people equally, giving priority to the worst off, and rewarding instrumental value (that is, giving priority to patients who can go on to help others, such as patients who are doctors).
Difficult choices
Their first recommendation for how to ethically allocate care in the COVID-19 pandemic is to prioritize saving the most lives and more years of life. That is, prioritizing people who are sick but likely to recover over those who are unlikely to recover with treatment or dont need treatment to recover. Because many of the severely ill patients who are most likely to recover are young, this also has the effect of giving priority to those who are worst off in the sense of being at risk of dying young and not having a full life.
Because maximizing benefits this way is seen as paramount, the researchers even note that it may be ethically justified for doctors to remove some patients from ventilators or ICU beds if other severely ill patient arrive with better chances of surviving.
Second, the researchers recommend giving health care workers priority for COVID-19 interventions because of their instrumental value. The interventions include testing, PPE, ICU beds, ventilators, and experimental vaccines and treatments. Because health care workers are critical for the recovery of other patients, prioritizing their care can maximize lives saved.
If doctors are faced with many similar patients with similar prognoses, the researchers third recommendation is that things like beds and ventilators should be allocated randomly, such as in a lottery. This is more ethical than allocating resources in a first-come, first-serve way, they argue. The latter approach may benefit those who simply live closer to health care facilities, may encourage crowding in a time when social distancing is important, and may penalize those who get sick later in the pandemic, possibly because they were trying to adhere to public health measures, such as social distancing.
Complex calculations
In their fourth recommendation, the researchers say that priorities for some resources should differ from others and follow the latest scientific evidence. For instance, the best way to maximize lives and life years is to prioritize some young patients over elderly ones when allocating ICU beds and ventilators. Conversely, it may be justified to prioritize vaccines for elderly over the young. This could maximize saving lives because the elderly tend to have higher rates of death from COVID-19. However, if data indicates that immunizing youth first would be the most effective way to reduce spread of the disease, that prioritization may be reversed.
Those who agree to take on the risks of participating in trials of experimental vaccines or treatments should also receive some priority in treatment, the researchers say in their fifth recommendation. But, such research participation should only be used as a tiebreaker among similar patients.
Lastly, the researchers suggest that these recommendations apply equally among COVID-19 patients and all other types of patients. They give the example that if a doctor suffers a life-threatening allergic reaction and needs a ventilator, the doctor should be given priority over COVID-19 patients who are not health care workers.
Of course, with the multitude of scenarios that may arise in the next few months, these guidelines will not provide clear answers in every instance. But what is clear, the researchers say, is a need for fair and consistent allocation procedures. And these procedures must be transparent to ensure public trust in their fairness. They note that reports of celebrities and the wealthy apparently receiving priority in testing has already eroded trust.
The researchers recommend that individual health care institutions have committees or appointed officials to help craft and apply their own guidelinesshaped by the above recommendations. Hopefully, hospitals wont need to use them. But if they do, it will both help keep overburdened doctors from making traumatic decisions on their own and help ensure equal treatment of patients.

8 with 8 posters participating
The director-general of the World Health Organization called for global unity and continued focus on saving lives and fighting the common enemy, COVID-19, on Wednesdaya day after US President Donald Trump attacked the organization for allegedly severely mismanaging the pandemic response. Trump announced he would halt funding to the WHO until his administration reviewed its response.
The WHO, an agency formed in the 1940s by the United Nations and supported by its member states, receives around 15 percent of its funding from the United States.We regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in funding to the World Health Organization, WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (aka Dr. Tedros) said in a press briefing Wednesday. With support from the people and government of the United States, WHO works to improve the health of many of the worlds poorest and most vulnerable people, he went on.
In addition to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO is working on beating back polio, measles, malaria, Ebola, HIV, tuberculosis, malnutrition, cancer, diabetes, mental health, and many other diseases and conditions, he said. We also work with countries to strengthen health systems and improve access to life-saving health services.
Its unclear how the loss of US funding will affect the organizations various activities, particularly the ones dealing with the current global health crisis. The organization is now reviewing potential impacts and plans to work with partners to try to fill any necessary gaps to keep its work going, Dr. Tedros said in the briefing. He added that he will inform the press on the findings of the review and plans to address funding gaps when they are complete.
In an apparent response to Trumps criticism over its handling of the pandemic, Dr. Tedros also noted that its member states and independent bodies will review is response to the pandemic in due course.
No doubt, areas for improvement will be identified and there will be lessons for all of us to learn, he said. But for now, our focusmy focusis on stopping this virus and saving lives.
He urged everyone to do the same. This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threata dangerous enemy. When we are divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us.
United
The message is a familiar one for Dr. Tedros, who has made solidarity a constant slogan of the global public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Please quarantine politicizing COVID, he pleaded in an April 8 press conference when asked about Trumps previous criticism of the organization. We will have many body bags in front of us if we dont behave. He added then: When there are cracks at national level and global level thats when the virus succeeds. For Gods sake, we have lost more than 60,000 citizens of the world.
That figure has since more than doubled. As of April 15, there are more than 2 million cases worldwide and 133,000 dead from the novel coronavirus, which exploded out of Chinas Hubei province less than four months ago. Now, the United States is the epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 632,000 cases and nearly 28,000 deaths.
With the globe now in the thick of a health and economic crisis, public health experts unanimously stood with WHO, chastising Trumps attacks and funding halt.
That includes the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield. In a Wednesday morning interview on Good Morning America, Redfield noted that CDC and WHO has had a long history of working together in multiple outbreaks throughout the world, as we continue to do in this one. And so, weve had a very productive public health relationship. We continue to have that.
He added that hed like to do the postmortem on this outbreak but only once we get through it together.
Consistent criticism
Other critics were less diplomatic in their response to Trumps attacks.
Dr. Peter Piotwho is the director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and a professor of global healthsaid the following in a media statement: Halting funding to the WHO is a dangerous, short-sighted, and politically motivated decision, with potential public health consequences for all countries in the world, whether they are rich or poor.
Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, added that the freeze on funding for WHO by the US government is a typically petulant act against an international organization that has sought to maintain its integrity and impartiality rather than to bow to President Trumps transient and volatile prejudices.
Lets hope President Trump &amp; the review team realize quickly that now is not the time for division and potentially weakening the UN authority on health who are busy coordinating the global response to the pandemic, Dr. Gail Carson, Director of Network Development at ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) at the University of Oxford said. Look at facts, and there is plenty evidence of all the good WHO has done during this pandemic.
Joshua Moon, a senior research fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said:
To see Trump threatening to pull funding from WHO in the middle of a pandemic is truly heartbreaking. The WHO has received so much criticism in the past decade surrounding its role in various public health emergencies. I have been one of those critics myself. However, this attack on WHO is a purely political move designed to distract and pander to Trumps base.
At its core: the loss of US funding for WHO is a huge problem that will impact the response to COVID-19 globally, invite new and potentially unaccountable actors into the position of power that the US previous held, and is a contemptible falsehood being peddled by a politician who in my opinion is trying to hide his own mistakes from his supporters.
Stephen Griffin, a medical professor and expert at viral diseases at the University of Leeds, echoed the thoughts, saying, This most recent intervention in public health policy by President Trump is perhaps one of the least productive, most short-sighted, self-motivated, and hypocritical acts I have ever witnessed. As far as I can ascertain, it has no foundation in reality.
The situation in the US and the world over amounts to a crisis, and one in which we must stand together, he went on. WHO is perhaps one of the best means of achieving this and deserves the support and respect of all countries."

Matching tie-dye sets are ubiquitous on TikTok, and spending so much time at home has made it easier for people to tie-dye clothing themselves.
At-home dyeing isn't for everyone, though. Those with small apartments, no outdoor space, or lots of roommates might find that tie-dyeing is just too messy for their limited real estate. Instead, might we suggest a tie-dye painting?
A tie-dye painting is exactly what it sounds like: a painting painted to look like tie-dye. (Wow!) Unlike regular tie-dye, however, it does not involve any squirting, wringing, soaking, or wrapping. Instead, your brushstrokes mimic the circles and swirls of a classic spiral dye job. (You can also hand-paint other tie-dye designs, but those are a bit more difficult.)
To start, you'll need your paints and your surface. Art supply shopping should not be your priority during quarantine (though if you have a car, shops like Michaels do offer curbside pickup
), so it's best to use whatever surface A random canvas! A Frisbee! A bunch of sheets of printer paper taped together! you have on hand. Whatever paints you have on hand are also fine, though watercolors will probably give you a look that's closest to actual tie-dye. Make sure to put newspaper or another layer underneath your masterpiece so as not to accidentally tie-dye your kitchen table, too.
From there, you can follow the instructions of any of these delightful tutorials. Our favorite is the above video from YouTuber Trippydraws
, who, as a bonus, has a super soothing voice.
When you've completed your masterpiece (and let it dry, you monster), you are free to do with it what you wish. Hang it in your room, hang it above your couch, give it as a gift, use it as a backdrop for TikToks, or shove it in a closet and never look at it again. Whatever you choose, one thing remains true: The project helped you kill a few hours. And that's priceless!"

The clinic is known for its reluctance to put patients with breathing difficulties on mechanical ventilators - the kind that involve tubes down the throat. 
The 48-year-old physician, father of two and aspiring triathlete worried that an invasive ventilator would be harmful. But soon after entering the clinic, Bergmann said, he struggled to breathe even with an oxygen mask, and felt so sick the ventilator seemed inevitable. 
Even so, his doctors never put him on a machine that would breathe for him. A week later, he was well enough to go home. 
Bergmann’s case illustrates a shift on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, as doctors rethink when and how to use mechanical ventilators to treat severe sufferers of the disease - and in some cases whether to use them at all. While initially doctors packed intensive care units with intubated patients, now many are exploring other options. 
Machines to help people breathe have become the major weapon for medics fighting COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 183,000 people. Within weeks of the disease’s global emergence in February, governments around the world raced to build or buy ventilators as most hospitals said they were in critically short supply. 
Germany has ordered 10,000 of them. Engineers from Britain to Uruguay are developing versions based on autos, vacuum cleaners or even windshield-wiper motors. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is spending $2.9 billion for nearly 190,000 ventilators. The U.S. government has contracted with automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co as well as medical device manufacturers, and full delivery is expected by the end of the year. Trump declared this week that the U.S. was now “the king of ventilators.” 
However, as doctors get a better understanding of what COVID-19 does to the body, many say they have become more sparing with the equipment. 
Reuters interviewed 30 doctors and medical professionals in countries including China, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United States, who have experience of dealing with COVID-19 patients. Nearly all agreed that ventilators are vitally important and have helped save lives. At the same time, many highlighted the risks from using the most invasive types of them - mechanical ventilators - too early or too frequently, or from non-specialists using them without proper training in overwhelmed hospitals. 
Medical procedures have evolved in the pandemic as doctors better understand the disease, including the types of drugs used in treatments. The shift around ventilators has potentially far-reaching implications as countries and companies ramp up production of the devices. 
GRAPHIC: Ventilators: a bridge between life and death? - here
“BETTER RESULTS” 
Many forms of ventilation use masks to help get oxygen into the lungs. Doctors’ main concern is around mechanical ventilation, which involves putting tubes into patients’ airways to pump air in, a process known as intubation. Patients are heavily sedated, to stop their respiratory muscles from fighting the machine. 
Those with severe oxygen shortages, or hypoxia, have generally been intubated and hooked up to a ventilator for up to two to three weeks, with at best a fifty-fifty chance of surviving, according to doctors interviewed by Reuters and recent medical research. The picture is partial and evolving, but it suggests people with COVID-19 who have been intubated have had, at least in the early stages of the pandemic, a higher rate of death than other patients on ventilators who have conditions such as bacterial pneumonia or collapsed lungs.  
This is not proof that ventilators have hastened death: The link between intubation and death rates needs further study, doctors say. 
In China, 86% of 22 COVID-19 patients didn’t survive invasive ventilation at an intensive care unit in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, according to a study published in The Lancet in February. Normally, the paper said, patients with severe breathing problems have a 50% chance of survival. A recent British study found two-thirds of COVID-19 patients put on mechanical ventilators ended up dying anyway, and a New York study found 88% of 320 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients had died. 
More recently, none of the eight patients who went on ventilators at the Abu Dhabi hospital had died as of April 9, a doctor there told Reuters. And one ICU doctor at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta said he had had a “good” week when almost half the COVID-19 patients were successfully taken off the ventilator, when he had expected more to die. 
The experiences can vary dramatically. The average time a COVID-19 patient spent on a ventilator at Scripps Health’s five hospitals in California’s San Diego County was just over a week, compared with two weeks at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem and three at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, medics at the hospitals said. 
In Germany, as patient Bergmann struggled to breathe, he said he was getting too desperate to care. 
“There came a moment when it simply no longer mattered,” he told Reuters. “At one point I was so exhausted that I asked my doctor if I was going to get better. I was saying, if I had no children or partner then it would be easier just to be left in peace.” 
Instead of putting Bergmann on a mechanical ventilator, the clinic gave him morphine and kept him on the oxygen mask. He’s since tested free of the infection, but not fully recovered. The head of the clinic, Thomas Voshaar, a German pulmonologist, has argued strongly against early intubation of COVID-19 patients. Doctors including Voshaar worry about the risk that ventilators will damage patients’ lungs. 
The doctors interviewed by Reuters agreed that mechanical ventilators are crucial life-saving devices, especially in severe cases when patients suddenly deteriorate. This happens to some when their immune systems go into overdrive in what is known as a “cytokine storm” of inflammation that can cause dangerously high blood pressure, lung damage and eventual organ failure. 
The new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, have been compared to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19, which killed 50 million people worldwide. Now as then, the disease is novel, severe and spreading rapidly, pushing the limits of the public health and medical knowledge required to tackle it. 
When coronavirus cases started surging in Louisiana, doctors at the state’s largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, saw an influx of people with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Patients with ARDS have inflammation in the lungs which can cause them to struggle to breathe and take rapid short breaths.  
“Initially we were intubating fairly quickly on these patients as they began to have more respiratory distress,” said Robert Hart, the hospital system’s chief medical officer. “Over time what we learned is trying not to do that.” 
Instead, Hart’s hospital tried other forms of ventilation using masks or thin nasal tubes, as Voshaar did with his German patient. “We seem to be seeing better results,” Hart said. 
CHANGED LUNGS 
Other doctors painted a similar picture. 
In Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged, doctors at Tongji Hospital at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology said they initially turned quickly to intubation. Li Shusheng, head of the hospital’s intensive care department, said a number of patients did not improve after ventilator treatment. 
“The disease,” he explained, “had changed their lungs beyond our imagination.” His colleague Xu Shuyun, a doctor of respiratory medicine, said the hospital adapted by cutting back on intubation. 
Luciano Gattinoni, a guest professor at the Department of Anaesthesiology, Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine, University of Göttingen in Germany, and a renowned expert in ventilators, was one of the first to raise questions about how they should be used to treat COVID-19. 
“I realised as soon as I saw the first CT scan ... that this had nothing to do with what we had seen and done for the past 40 years,” he told Reuters. 
In a paper published by the American Thoracic Society on March 30, Gattinoni and other Italian doctors wrote that COVID-19 does not lead to “typical” respiratory problems. Patients’ lungs were working better than they would expect for ARDS, they wrote - they were more elastic. So, he said, mechanical ventilation should be given “with a lower pressure than the one we are used to.” 
Ventilating some COVID-19 sufferers as if they were standard patients with ARDS is not appropriate, he told Reuters. “It’s like using a Ferrari to go to the shop next door, you press on the accelerator and you smash the window.” 
The Italians were swiftly followed by Cameron Kyle-Sidell, a New York physician who put out a talk on YouTube saying that by preparing to put patients on ventilators, hospitals in America were treating “the wrong disease.” Ventilation, he feared, would lead to “a tremendous amount of harm to a great number of people in a very short time.” This remains his view, he told Reuters this week. 
When Spain’s outbreak erupted in mid-March, many patients went straight onto ventilators because lung X-rays and other test results “scared us,” said Delia Torres, a physician at the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante. They now focus more on breathing and a patient’s overall condition than just X-rays and tests. And they intubate less. “If the patient can get better without it, then there’s no need,” she said. 
In Germany, lung specialist Voshaar was also concerned. A mechanical ventilator itself can damage the lungs, he says. This means patients stay in intensive care longer, blocking specialist beds and creating a vicious circle in which ever more ventilators are needed. 
Of the 36 acute COVID-19 patients on his ward in mid-April, Voshaar said, one had been intubated - a man with a serious neuro-muscular disorder - and he was the only patient to die. Another 31 had recovered. 
“IRON LUNGS” 
Some doctors cautioned that the impression that the rush to ventilate is harmful may be partly due to the sheer numbers of patients in today’s pandemic. 
People working in intensive care units know that the mortality rate of ARDS patients who are intubated is around 40%, said Thierry Fumeaux, head of an ICU in Nyon, Switzerland, and president of the Swiss Intensive Care Medicine Society. That is high, but may be acceptable in normal times, when there are three or four patients in a unit and one of them doesn’t make it. 
“When you have 20 patients or more, this becomes very evident,” said Fumeaux. “So you have this feeling - and I’ve heard this a lot - that ventilation kills the patient.” That’s not the case, he said. “No, it’s not the ventilation that kills the patient, it’s the lung disease.” 
Mario Riccio, head of anaesthesiology and resuscitation at the Oglio Po hospital near Cremona in Lombardy, Italy’s worst-hit region, says the machines are the only treatment to save a COVID-19 patient in serious condition. “The fact that people who were placed under mechanical ventilation in some cases die does not undermine this statement.” 
Originally nicknamed “iron lungs” when introduced in the 1920s and 1930s, mechanical ventilators are sometimes also called respirators. They use pressure to blow air - or a mixture of gases such as oxygen and air - into the lungs. 
They can be set to exhale it, too, effectively taking over a patient’s entire breathing process when their lungs fail. The aim is to give the body enough time to fight off an infection to be able to breathe independently and recover. 
Some patients need them because they’re losing the strength to breathe, said Yoram Weiss, director of Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem. “It is very important to ventilate them before they collapse.” At his hospital, 24 of 223 people with COVID-19 had been put on ventilators by April 13. Of those, four had died and three had come off the machines. 
AEROSOLS 
Simpler forms of ventilation - face masks for example - are easier to administer. But respirator masks can release micro-droplets known as aerosols which may spread infection. Some doctors said they avoided the masks, at least at first, because of that risk. 
While mechanical ventilators do not produce aerosols, they carry other risks. Intubation requires patients to be heavily sedated so their respiratory muscles fully surrender. The recovery can be lengthy, with a risk of permanent lung damage. 
Now that the initial wave of COVID-19 cases has peaked in many countries, doctors have time to examine other ways of managing the disease and are fine-tuning their approach. 
Voshaar, the German lung specialist, said some doctors were approaching COVID-19 lung problems as they would other forms of pneumonia. In a healthy patient, oxygen saturation - a measure of how much oxygen the haemoglobin in the blood contains - is around 96% of the maximum amount the blood can hold. When doctors check patients and see lower levels, indicating hypoxia, Voshaar said, they can overreact and race to intubate. 
“We lung doctors see this all the time,” Voshaar told Reuters. “We see 80% and still do nothing and let them breathe spontaneously. The patient doesn’t feel great, but he can eat and drink and sit on the side of his bed.” 
He and other doctors think other tests can help before intubation. Voshaar looks at a combination of measures including how fast the patient is breathing and their heart rate. His team are also guided by lung scans. 
“HAPPY HYPOXICS” 
Several doctors in New York said they too had started to consider how to treat patients, known as “happy hypoxics,” who can talk and laugh with no signs of mental cloudiness even though their oxygen might be critically low. 
Rather than rushing to intubate, doctors say they now look for other ways to boost the patients’ oxygen. One method, known as “proning,” is telling or helping patients to roll over and lie on their fronts, said Scott Weingart, head of emergency critical care at Stony Brook University Medical Center on Long Island. 
“If patients are left in one position in bed, they tend to desaturate, they lose the oxygen in their blood,” Weingart said. Lying on the front shifts any fluid in the lungs to the front and frees up the back of the lungs to expand better. “The position changes have radically impressive effects on the patient’s oxygen saturations.” 
Weingart does recommend intubating a communicative patient with low oxygen levels if they start to lose mental clarity, if they experience a cytokine storm or if they start to really struggle to breathe. He feels there are enough ventilators for such patients at his hospital. 
But for happy hypoxics, “I still don’t want these patients on ventilators, because I think it’s hurting them, not helping them.” 
QUALITY, SKILL 
As governments in the United States and elsewhere are scrambling to raise output of ventilators, some doctors worry the fast-built machines may not be up to snuff. 
Doctors in Spain wrote to their local government to complain that ventilators it had bought were designed for use in ambulances, not intensive care units, and some were of poor quality. In the UK, the government has cancelled an order for thousands of units of a simple model because more sophisticated devices are needed. 
More important, many doctors say, is that the additional machines will need highly trained and experienced operators.

“It’s not just about running out of ventilators, it’s running out of expertise,” said David Hill, a pulmonology and critical care physician in Waterbury, Connecticut, who attends at Waterbury Hospital. 
Long-term ventilation management is complex, but Hill said some U.S. hospitals were trying to bring non-critical care physicians up to speed fast with webinars or even tip sheets. “That is a recipe for bad outcomes.” 
“We intensivists don’t ventilate by protocol,” said Hill. “We may choose initial settings,” he said, “but we adjust those settings. It’s complicated.”

French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among leaders taking part in a videoconference to announce the plan, but the United States was not participating. 
Following is reaction from around the world to the WHO’s initiative:

“The world needs these tools and needs them fast. 
“We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach.” 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN 
“This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future.” 
SPOKESMAN FOR THE U.S. MISSION IN GENEVA 
“There will be no U.S. official participation. 
“We look forward to learning more about this initiative in support of international cooperation to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 as soon as possible.” 
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON 
“It would be inexplicable and inexcusable to say that this vaccine would only be accessible in the country it was invented in or where Big Pharma have invested. 
“From the moment we win this battle, we must make this vaccine accessible to all populations as soon as possible and everywhere. 
“We will continue now to mobilise all G7 and G20 countries so they get behind this initiative. And I hope we’ll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the US because this is about saying: the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle.” 
MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER MUHYIDDIN YASSIN 
“The world needs to come together to coordinate our efforts and expedite the development of effective tools to stop the spread of this disease. 
“The role of the United Nations remains one of our strongest modalities to curb this pandemic in a manner that can ensure that the arsenals in this war that we are fighting can reach everyone, everywhere, in the shortest time possible. 
“Malaysia is fully committed to be part of this... and to take part in the manufacturing of some of these tools and vaccines as they become available.”"

But some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure. Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable and what patients should do about it have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs. 
Researchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart. They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it. Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension. 
The drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions. In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci - the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert - cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus. 
Efforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies. 
“There are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,” said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore. “This is one of the most important clinical questions.” 
An estimated 100 million U.S. residents suffer from high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. About four-fifths of them need to take prescription drugs to control it, according to the CDC. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely prescribed to patients with congestive heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease. The drugs account for billions of dollars in prescription sales worldwide. 
The absence of clear answers on how the drugs impact COVID-19 patients has sparked rampant speculation in correspondence and editorials posted on medical journal websites and those where scientists share unreviewed, pre-publication study drafts. 
Many patients are agonizing over whether their medicines will help or hurt them. Doris Kertzner, 88, of Redding, Conn., said she has carefully followed experts’ guidelines for preventing infection and keeps her distance from others in her retirement community. Now she has a new worry: She takes losartan, an ARB, and can’t decide whether to stop. 
Dropping the medicine “presents its own problems” in dealing with her high blood pressure. 
“It’s gotten very complicated,” she said. 
Dr Carlos M. Ferrario - a researcher at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and co-author of widely cited studies on ACE inhibitors - understands patients’ plight. 
“There is a lot of paranoia and a lot of speculation with very little fundamental, convincing information,” he said. 
The National Institutes of Health in the United States has put out a call seeking proposals for studies into the issue. An independent consortium of researchers has launched a global study to analyze health records for thousands of COVID-19 patients in the United States, Europe and Asia. That project is part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, an open-source research platform that enables large-scale studies. 
Dr Marc Suchard - a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles who is leading the study - said that it aims to determine whether the medicines make infections more likely or more severe - or, by contrast, whether they help protect against the virus. Suchard said he expects a preliminary report within two weeks.

There is evidence that the drugs may increase the presence of an enzyme - ACE2 - that produces hormones that lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels. That’s normally a good thing. But the coronavirus also targets ACE2 and has developed spikes that can latch on to the enzyme and penetrate cells, researchers have found. So more enzymes provide more targets for the virus, potentially increasing the chance of infection or making it more severe. 
Other evidence, however, suggests the infection’s interference with ACE2 may lead to higher levels of a hormone that causes inflammation, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a dangerous build-up of fluid in the lungs. In that case, ARBs may be beneficial because they block some of the hormone’s damaging effects. 
Novartis International AG and Sanofi SA are among the major drugmakers selling ACE inhibitors and ARBs. 
Sanofi spokesman Nicolas Kressmann said that patients should consult their doctors on whether to continue taking the drugs but that the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19 through its own assessment of available scientific data. 
The company reviewed several recent studies from China that came to conflicting conclusions about whether COVID-19 patients with hypertension fare worse than other patients, he said. 
Novartis has not issued any guidance to clinicians or patients and defers to scientists studying the issue, said spokesman Eric Althoff. 
Researchers and doctors generally agree that people with severe hypertension or heart failure should keep taking the drugs because of the high risks of stopping. The debate centers on how to advise the many patients with milder conditions who take the drugs. Two camps have emerged - one calling for no action unless the drugs are proven dangerous, the other for some limits on their use until they are proven safe. 
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at University of Oxford in England has recommended that clinicians consider withdrawing the medicines in patients with mild hypertension if they are in a high risk group, such as medical workers - and replacing them with alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs. 
The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) took the opposite tack, highlighting the drugs’ potential in fighting coronavirus and recommending patients continue taking the drugs until more about the risks is known. Several of the scientists who co-authored it had done extensive, industry-supported research on antihypertensive drugs. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Dr Kevin Kavanagh, founder of Health Watch USA, a patient advocacy organization, questioned whether scientists who are funded by the drug industry should be advising clinicians, given the high stakes. 
“You need to consider stepping back, and let others without a conflict of interest try to make a call,” Kavanagh said. 
His organization recommends that doctors temporarily avoid putting new patients on the drugs and warn those currently on them to take extreme precautions to avoid virus exposure. 
Dr Scott David Solomon, a co-author of the NEJM article, conducts industry-financed research but said it has no influence on his position. 
“Not only is there no compelling evidence that we should be discontinuing those medications, but there’s reason to think that doing so might actually cause harm,” said Solomon, who is the director of noninvasive cardiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. 
The lack of consensus leaves doctors to navigate the issue patient by patient. Alexander, of Johns Hopkins, is trying to strike a balance in his own practice. Patients with more severe blood-pressure problems may need to keep taking the medicines, he said, while patients with milder or newly diagnosed cases could instead take one of the “literally dozens” of alternative hypertension treatments. 
“Rest assured,” he said, “there are dozens of scientific teams working feverishly to put this question to bed.”

Reynolds, an Associate Professor in the College of Public Health at the University of Arizona. She authored a study about hygienic preventions to prevent viral spread. ""Like our hands, they pick up germs along the way. Frequently touched surfaces are vulnerable to increased contamination that can spread to hands, and then to entry points on the body where infection occurs, such as the eyes, nose and mouth.""
According to the CDC, transmission of the COVID-19 virus from surfaces has not yet been documented -- it's much more common via respiratory droplets or direct human contact. But, the CDC suggests cleaning any surfaces down all the same, as the virus can last from hours to several days on some materials. A recent study showed that the COVID-19 virus in particular can last up to 24 hours on cardboard and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The CDC states that ""cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.""
""If you touch something contaminated, such as your phone, after hand washing, you need to wash it again to clear the virus away,"" said Dr. Jonathan Golob, an Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Medicine.
The consensus is clear: You need to be cleaning the gadgets that you use often. That includes your phone, and for some of you, your laptop or keyboard as well.
Be gone, germs
How best to clean your phone will differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, but there are a few general guidelines. Obviously, the first thing to do is to remove any protective case as well as unplug any cables. For general-purpose cleaning, nearly all manufacturers suggest gently wiping down the phone with a soft, lint-free cloth. Both Apple and Samsung suggest using a microfiber material or a camera lens cleaning cloth, for example. If your phone is a little grimier than normal, then you can use a dampened cloth to wipe the smudge away, being careful to avoid excess moisture getting into any open ports.
But simply wiping your phone down won't get rid of germs. To do so, you can use soap. ""Coronavirus has a fat coating it needs to infect us,"" said Golob. ""Soap and water or alcohol gels destroy this fatty layer, and thus make the virus unable to infect us."" But, be sure to check the manufacturer's website to make sure soap is allowed. Apple, for example, suggests using a cloth dampened with warm, soapy water, but only with the iPhone 11 line of handsets (you can then ""rinse"" the soap off with another damp cloth, then dry it off with another one). Google recommends using ordinary household soap only on the back and sides of the Pixel. Samsung, on the other hand, doesn't recommend soap at all.
For an even easier way to sanitize your phone, you could use disinfecting wipes. We were once advised not to use alcohol wipes on our phones, as they could potentially remove the oleophobic coating that prevents fingerprint smudges. But recently, Apple released a statement that it's OK to use 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipes or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as long as they don't have any bleach. Google and Samsung have similar recommendations as well. That said, all three companies strongly advise against pouring the alcohol solution directly onto the phone; use the cloths and wipes instead.
Cleaning your laptop is very similar to cleaning your phone; start with a dry lint-free cloth and move on to a slightly dampened cloth for wiping down the screen. For a deeper, sanitizing clean, manufacturers like Apple and Lenovo have recommended using the aforementioned disinfectant wipes for both the display and the keyboard. If it's an external keyboard, you can also use compressed air to clear away any dust particles, though that won't kill any germs.
An alternate option is to buy a UV sanitizer like PhoneSoap, which uses UV-C light to ""clean"" your phone in just ten minutes. ""UV-C light is effective against a wide range of germs and provides an option for disinfecting your phone without the use of chemicals,"" said Reynolds. While that might be true, it's unclear if this has been tested with the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, these UV sanitizers tend to be very expensive, and don't seem to be any more effective than simply using the wipes.
As for how frequently you should clean your devices, well, that depends. ""You may want to disinfect your phone after using it in the bathroom, or before using it at the dining room table,"" said Reynolds. ""Developing a habit of daily disinfection will help to keep the germ count low.""
Golob generally agrees. ""A good rule of thumb is to clean the device and then your hands—particularly before eating or touching your face.""
Don't do this:
Even though some of these warnings were alluded to above, they bear repeating:
<ul><li>Avoid getting moisture into any openings or ports</li><li>Avoid window cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, solvents, ammonia, abrasives, or cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide.</li><li>Avoid bleach especially</li><li>Avoid abrasive cloths and materials, such as paper towels</li><li>Avoid submerging the products in cleaning solution</li><li>Avoid excessive wiping that might damage the product</li></ul>In general, be sure to check the manufacturer's website before cleaning your device so you don't ruin it.
Keeping it clean
Aside from keeping your phone and laptop clean according to the above instructions, there are a few extra steps you can take to ensure proper gadget hygiene. ""Another way to keep your phone clean is to keep your hands clean before use and avoid sharing your electronics with others,"" said Reynolds. ""Avoiding contact with your face, from either your hands or your device, is another approach to breaking the cycle of germ transmission.""
What could prove harder to do, however, is to simply not touch it as much. Experts suggest not using it while eating, and not while on the toilet. ""Treat your gadgets as another hand,"" Golob said. ""They can get contaminated with coronavirus, spread it to you and others, and make you sick."""

The further clampdown on exports was adopted two days before EU leaders hold a conference call on Thursday meant to strengthen financial solidarity across the bloc in the fight against the pandemic and preserve its common market, which is based on free movement of goods. 
The European Commission sent a letter on April 7 to the French government urging it to lift export restrictions on dozens of vital medicines to treat coronavirus patients, EU officials told Reuters. 
But instead of heeding the call, Paris has vastly extended the list of drugs covered by restrictions, according to a letter seen by Reuters that was sent by the French drugs regulator ANSM to pharmaceutical distributors on April 21. 
The temporary restrictions apply to those distributors. Manufacturers, such as French pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi (SASY.PA), are exempted from the export curbs. 
The French prime minister’s office, the health ministry and the drugs regulator did not answer requests for comment. 
One industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said the French restrictions were aimed at preventing distributors from selling drugs abroad at higher prices during a severe outbreak of COVID-19, the disease cased by the virus, at home. 
Among drugs that distributors cannot export from France are antibiotics, painkillers, sedatives and muscle relaxants, as well as several drugs being tested as possible treatments for COVID-19, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir, ANSM lists show. 
The curbs also apply to insulin, which is vital to millions of people with diabetes across Europe. 
Several of the affected medicines are not in short supply in France, but are in some other EU states. 
That is the case, for instance, with atracurium and rocuronium, two muscle relaxants used to connect critically ill COVID-19 patients to ventilators. 
Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium were among EU nations that warned these two drugs could soon no longer be available in their countries, according to an EU internal list of medicines in shortage, dated April 1 and seen by Reuters. 
LEGAL ACTION? 
A spokeswoman for the European Commission told Reuters on Thursday France was among the few EU countries that had ignored calls to lift certain trade barriers on medicines. 
She said talks were underway to persuade France, a key hub for drugs distribution across Europe, to remove “disproportionate” restrictions. If no compromise is reached, the Commission could take legal action against Paris, she said. 
Half of EU states have drawn up long lists of drugs whose export has been curbed during the coronavirus emergency.. 
The Commission has repeatedly said these measures, which vary from fully-fledged bans to requirements for export authorisations, risk causing shortages in other countries of the 27-nation bloc. 
It sent letters to France, Poland, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and other central-eastern European countries urging them to remove barriers “that could hamper our collective ability to respond to the coronavirus outbreak effectively,” according to an EU document seen by Reuters. 
Some eastern states have partly heeded the EU calls, three EU officials said, citing Poland and Slovakia among countries that have removed some restrictions. 
France, the EU’s second-largest economy, caused an outcry from EU partners in early March when it decided to curb exports of personal protection gear, such as face masks. 
The measure was judged by Brussels as legal because sales abroad were still allowed if pre-authorised, but that triggered similar moves by other EU states, leading to delays and exacerbating the shortage of protective gear across Europe. 
Germany also initially banned the export of protective equipment, but after EU pressure removed restrictions.

The Des Moines, Iowa-based company also rescinded its financial guidance for the year. 
Meredith joins a number of large news media companies including Gannett Co Inc and McClatchy Co looking to slash costs through pay cuts, furloughs and layoffs as advertisers drastically cut spending. 
The tiered pay cuts will last from May 4 to Sept. 4, and some employees will work under reduced hours. Meredith also said it would freeze hiring and significantly reduce freelancers. About 2,200 of Meredith’s employees will get a 15% pay cut, and the company’s highest-paid employees will face reductions ranging from 20% to 40%. 
Meredith President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Harty said in statement that the declining advertising market created an “extremely challenging business environment.” 
Meredith has also lobbied for stimulus relief money for its news stations in local markets. 
Advertising makes up about half of Meredith’s revenue. Meredith owns a portfolio of lifestyle magazines that include Better Homes &amp; Gardens, Shape and Southern Living. It also owns 17 television stations in top 25 markets including Portland and Atlanta. 
The publishing company said in a news release that it is pausing stock dividends until the advertising market returns to normal.

 Thanks to the Morning Brew for recommending us as an “Essential” read. Here’s hoping all of you who signed up over the weekend find The Interface a useful guide to tech, democracy, and the pandemic. 
Facebook is a publicly traded company that mostly operates in rational and predictable ways. Facebook is also a collection of posts from more than 2 billion people, and an enduring lesson from the company’s history is that those people often operate in irrational and unpredictable ways. This weekend we got to witness an important tension between the two.
Facebook the company is fighting the good fight against the global pandemic. It has donated more than $100 million to small businesses and is prominently displaying vetted information from public health authorities across Facebook and Instagram. It released maps illustrating regional mobility patterns that have informed elected officials’ decisions to close parks and beaches. It’s using machine-learning systems to help hospitals anticipate spikes in demand for intensive care unit beds, ventilators, and other supplies.
And on Monday, the company announced early results from its symptom tracker, which is asking people across the country to self-report their health status in a survey conducted by Carnegie Mellon University. Two weeks in, researchers say that results from the tracker correlate with available public health data, suggesting that the 150,000 reports a day the survey is generating can be used as an effective surrogate for in-person surveys. On Wednesday the survey will go international, in coordination with researchers at the University of Maryland. 
It’s way too soon to evaluate which tech giant has made the most effective contributions to the pandemic response. But it seems to me like Facebook may have made the most contributions to the response, at least in terms of sheer number of projects.
I don’t doubt the sincerity of any of these efforts, and I suspect many of Facebook’s efforts will be quite helpful. (Several researchers have in fact already told me that they have been.) And yet it also feels fair game to note that these projects buttress two pillars of Facebook’s strategic messaging: that its vast size does more good than harm, and that its commitment to free speech is a pro-democratic force.
I spoke with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday, and he emphasized both points. From my story in The Verge — point one, on the value of size:

Zuckerberg said that while Facebook would not seek to interpret the symptom data it shares with researchers, its size has enabled it to make a significant contribution to the public health response.

“What we can do is help them get a survey out to a large number of people quickly, and on a daily basis,” he said. “Since we have a basic understanding of who people are, we can make sure that it’s sampled properly. We’re in a relatively unique position where I don’t think that there are that many institutions in the world that could stand up a survey like this — across the country, much less across the world.”


And point two, on the value of free speech:

Zuckerberg said that global maps could serve as a reality check in places where elected officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of COVID-19 within their borders.

“Some of these governments, frankly, are not excited about the world knowing how many actual cases there might be, or indicators of how it’s spreading in their countries,” Zuckerberg said. “So getting that data out there is very important.”


He elaborated on that point in an op-ed today in the Washington Post. Again, there are a lot of people at Facebook working hard to reduce the impact of the pandemic around the world. But it’s also true that the moment has presented the company with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to demonstrate the merits of its size and and its free-speech ethos, and Zuckerberg is seizing it.
But while Facebook the company works on its maps and its symptom trackers, Facebook the user base continues to post in sometimes dangerous ways. In recent weeks users have gone into overdrive spreading misinformation related to the coronavirus, and one report found that just 100 pieces of false COVID-19 content had 117 million views. And then over the past week, some people began using Facebook to organize protests of legal orders to stay home. Here are Isaac Stanley-Becker and Tony Romm in the Washington Post:
The Facebook groups target Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and they appear to be the work of Ben Dorr, the political director of a group called “Minnesota Gun Rights,” and his siblings, Christopher and Aaron. By Sunday, the groups had roughly 200,000 members combined, and they continued to expand quickly, days after President Trump endorsed such protests by suggesting citizens should “liberate” their states.

You can see a clear path forward for what comes next. Posts in these groups will generate outrage, which will drive engagement, which will earn the posts and groups more algorithmic promotion within Facebook. Membership in the groups will swell, viewpoints will harden around partisan lines, and the social fabric will tear a bit more. None of this will be caused by Facebook, exactly, but some aspects may be worsened by it. By Monday there were more than 100 such state-specific groups, with more than 900,000 members, who had organized at least 49 events, NBC News reported.
ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked Zuckerberg how the company would respond. Here’s what he said, as captured by Joe Concha at The Hill:

“We do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,” Zuckerberg said. “At the same time, it’s important that people can debate policies, so there’s a line on this, you know, more than normal political discourse. I think a lot of the stuff that people are saying that is false around a health emergency like this can be classified as harmful misinformation.”

A spokesperson for Facebook told The Hill that the events would only be taken down if they violate state laws, meaning that many protests against social distancing guidelines could continue to be organized on the platform unless they break the guidelines themselves.


There’s currently a debate among journalists about how much oxygen to give these protests. (It’s a good time to re-read Data & Society’s Oxygen of Amplification report.) A majority of Republicans continue to support stay-at-home orders, along with virtually all Democrats. The protests themselves remain relatively small. But what if they grow? And what if the Facebook groups that organize these events grow along with them, aided by prominent placement in the News Feed? 
These are the same mechanics that helped fueled the rise of anti-vaccination zealots, ISIS, and — most famously — Russian election interference. They are mechanics that benefit enormously from Facebook’s vast reach and its commitment to permit the maximum amount of speech. And they are mechanics that seem to be working basically as well as they ever have.
And so on one hand you have Facebook the company working to stop the spread of the pandemic, and on the other you have a small but growing group of users working to exacerbate it. It’s easy to assume that the corporate effort, which draw on Facebook’s wealth of resources, will have the largest impact. But history has taught us that what happens at Facebook is usually not as important as what happens on Facebook.
Pushback
On Thursday I wrote about Facebook’s efforts to fight COVID-19 misinformation and noted that people who are shown links to popular coronavirus myths won’t be informed that they are seeing it because they shared a falsehood. A spokeswoman followed up to remind me that while this is true, if you do share a falsehood and Facebook removes it, you do get a notification about that. “For people who share misinformation that’s later debunked, we send explicit notifications telling them false info was found in their post, share the fact-checker’s articles, and let them know we’ve placed a label on their content saying that it’s false,” the spokeswoman said. A fair point, and something I should have included.

Australia’s government has pledged to tackle the “power imbalance” between the digital giants and traditional media, adding to a barrage of global action against Google and Facebook. Regulators worldwide have been trying to loosen the tech giants’ grip on everything from advertising and search engines to news, data and elections.

Frydenberg said the government was “very conscious of the challenges” of forcing the companies to pay for news content, after efforts in France and Spain had failed. The payment model could be based on the cost of preparing journalistic content, or the value added to the digital platform by using it, he said.

Industry
⭐Dropbox privately paid top hackers to find bugs in Zoom’s software years before the company’s security flaws became national news. They said Zoom was slow to fix the flaws, even after being alerted to them. Natasha Singer and Nicole Perlroth at The New York Times report:

As part of a novel security assessment program for its vendors and partners, Dropbox in 2018 began privately offering rewards to top hackers to find holes in Zoom’s software code and that of a few other companies. The former Dropbox engineers said they were stunned by the volume and severity of the security flaws that hackers discovered in Zoom’s code — and troubled by Zoom’s slowness in fixing them.

After Dropbox presented the hackers’ findings from the Singapore event to Zoom Video Communications, the California company behind the videoconferencing service, it took more than three months for Zoom to fix the bug, the former engineers said. Zoom patched the vulnerability only after another hacker publicized a different security flaw with the same root cause.

To start, the company's drivers will deliver medical supplies and test kits to the elderly, people with chronic diseases and other vulnerable individuals. They will also transport food to seniors, as well as students who depend on their school for lunch. Lyft says it plans to pilot the food project first in the San Francisco Bay Area, before making it available throughout California and the rest of the country. In both instances, the company's drivers will deliver items without coming into contact with the people who they're delivering supplies to.
Lastly, the company has partnered with eight Medicaid agencies to provide non-emergency transportation to people who need help getting to their medical appointments. It says it's working with states across the country to expand access.
In addition to the above efforts, Reuters reports co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green will through to the end of June donate their salaries to help the company's drivers. They say they will also find them other temporary work opportunities.
At the start of the month, both Uber and Lyft said they would provide employees with 14 days of paid sick leave to drivers who were either infected by the coronavirus or quarantined by a public health agency. According to a tracker from The New York Times, COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed 266 people in the US. There are currently more than 21,000 confirmed cases across the country."

""We're designing it to be very adaptive so that on a day-to-day basis the messages ... vary from location to location,"" Zuckerberg said during a call with reporters announcing the update. He noted that while many people are aware of the threat posed by coronavirus, ""a lot of what needs to happen is people need to be convinced"" to take social distancing seriously.
The information center will also offer statistics tracking confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and include information on school closures, according to screenshots of the feature.

The information center is the latest, and perhaps most aggressive, step Facebook has taken in the wake of the pandemic.

While SETI@Home is closing, UC Berkeley's other astrophysics projects that use BOINC will still harness your computing time, if you're offering.

The factory — dubbed the “eighth wonder of the world” by President Trump — was first announced back in 2017 and has been the focus of controversy ever since. While its arrival promised new job opportunities for the state, many homes would subsequently be bulldozed to make space for the plant. It was initially earmarked for use as an LCD factory, but plans have repeatedly changed and the ample job opportunities never materialized. For the few that did, pay and working conditions was were way below those originally touted by Foxconn. Meanwhile, the plant was in receipt of more than $4.5 billion in government incentives. The whole endeavour has certainly fallen short of its promises."

According to Live Science, the biggest killers in the US were heart disease which killed 1,774 people a day in 2018 and cancer which killed 1,641 people a day in 2018. The new coronavirus killed more than 1,940 on April 8.

Something is loading.
On April 16, The Washington Post reported that between April 6 and April 12, COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death right behind heart disease and accounted for 12,392 deaths. In around four weeks, COVID-19 deaths went from 337 deaths between March 16 to March 22, to over 12,000 deaths between April 6 and April 12, to now being the leading cause of death in America. 
However, The Post also added that different areas of the country were dealing with different realities in terms of COVID-19 deaths. In New York state coronavirus deaths were exponentially larger than deaths from other causes. More than 5,200 people died from COVID-19 in New York state April 6 and April 12, compared to the 870 from heart disease, the second leading cause of death. Similar trends were noticed in Louisiana and Washington, DC. 
However, those weren't the trends in states like California or Washington. During that same week, while there were 332 coronavirus deaths in California, 1,178  people died from heart disease and another 1,127 people died from cancer. 
The numbers of cancer and heart disease deaths are based on the ""normal number of deaths"" during the time period, based on numbers from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The US currently has close to 800,000 coronavirus cases with over more than 42,900 deaths."

Accordingly, Microsoft is making that wearable tech more affordable. It’s currently selling Samsung’s 40mm non-cellular Galaxy Watch Active 2 for $199, or a full $80 off the official price. That’s better than typical sales hovering around $220 to $250. The deal isn’t quite as sweet for the 44mm model (it’s $269, or $30 off), but the 40mm discount could easily be tempting if you don’t mind a smaller watch or just want affordable yet capable wristwear.
The Active 2 doesn’t have spectacular battery life with one day of typical use, but that’s arguably more than enough for a run outside or an at-home exercise routine. And at this price, the battery is easier to forgive considering other advantages. Samsung’s watch has solid activity tracking features, a reasonable selection of third-party apps like Spotify and an interface that’s surprisingly powerful given some tight confines. And remember, this watch works with both Android and iOS. While the Active 2 unsurprisingly favors Android phones, this could be a viable companion to an iPhone if you don’t care for the Apple Watch’s design or features."

Three new deaths caused by the new coronavirus were reported in King County, Washington where an outbreak is occurring among patients at a nursing facility. There are now 14 cases in King County, including five deaths two of which were previously reported. A sixth patient, whose case originated in Snohomish County, also died.
The deaths were in a man in his 70s, a woman in her 70s, and a woman in her 80s. Two of the three were patients at Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington. Another new case, a woman in her 80s who has been hospitalized, was also linked to Life Care. That brings the number of cases that are linked to Life Care to nine.
Long-term care facilities provide an ideal environment for acquisition and spread of infection
The Life Care cluster of illnesses appears to be the first in the US and is alarming to health experts because the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, is particularly deadly for older people. Unfortunately, long-term care facilities provide an ideal environment for acquisition and spread of infection, according to a study from 2003. The residents are already vulnerable, either because of age or underlying health conditions or both and theyre in close proximity, making it easier to transmit the illness.
Of the 108 residents and 180 staff at Life Care, 27 residents and 25 staff members have symptoms of the virus, Washington health officials said on Saturday. In addition, 25 firefighters as well as two police officers were exposed to the virus, though they havent shown any symptoms yet, The Washington Post reported. In response to the outbreak, family visits as well as those from volunteers and vendors, have been halted,Kaiser Health News reported. King County will buy a motel in order to place COVID-19 patients in isolation.
The virus may have been circulating in Washington for six weeks, according to a genetic analysis. Researchers compared two samples of the virus, one from a person who traveled to Snohomish County from China in January, and one from a recently diagnosed high school student with no obvious cause. The genetic sequences were nearly identical, according to Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Although the work is early, Bedford believes there isnt another good explanation for the similarity because of an unusual variant on one of the genes.
But most people had no idea the virus was circulating because the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wasnt actively testing for the novel coronavirus in people with no known exposures to the illness either from travel to an affected area or close contact with an existing case until last week. That means detection of the novel coronavirus in the community lagged dangerously behind the viruss actual circulation.
positive tests are essentially snapshots of where the virus was several days ago
Under the best of circumstances, testing would lag anyway because most people dont show symptoms of COVID-19 for a few days. So positive tests are essentially snapshots of where the virus was several days ago. But by keeping the test criteria narrow, the CDC lost valuable time to prevent outbreaks like the one at Life Care. Now health officials are scrambling to catch up.
On February 26th, the first possible case of community-spread COVID-19 in the country was announced in California. The patient, from Solano County, had already been placed on a ventilator when she arrived at the University of California Davis Medical Center on February 19th, where the team immediately requested testing for the coronavirus, according to the Davis Enterprise. The CDC didnt test the patient until Feb. 23rd. The CDC claims it has not said no to any requests for testing. 
Information has also been throttled by Vice President Mike Pence, who now controls all federal communication about the virus. Any federal expert who wishes to speak about the illness must now get Pences sign-off, The Washington Post reported. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has pushed back on that reporting, claiming he is not being muzzled. As of this week, the CDC has dropped the number of people its tested from its website, just as the number of tests is set to rise. 
Amid all this confusion, one health expert told ProPublica that efforts to corral the illness are weeks behind. To determine how widely the virus is circulating in areas like Washington and California, health officials could test a random sample of hundreds of people and find out how many of them test positive. (This is called surveillance testing.) Until widespread testing is the norm, well still be behind the illness with tragic consequences. At least in the case of Life Care, the delay on tracking and containing the disease seems to have been deadly.

Firstly, it'll make portrait and zoom photography a little better, since the cameras will be able to tell how far an object (or person) is away from the lens. Secondly, it's likely to bolster Apple's stated push for augmented reality, since you'll have accurate depth information to project images.
It's worth saying that there's a couple of caveats here: Firstly, we don't know how much the current situation with Covid-19 will impact Apple's product roadmap. Second, Fast Company itself says that this feature has been kicked around by Apple before, and has previously been cut. Although it's likely that, with just six months before any planned iPhone launch, that Apple has already locked in this year's new features.
This wouldn't be the first time that Mark Sullivan has come good with a rumor about the iPhone (and one related to Lumentum). In the run-up to the iPhone X's launch, he wrote about a laser sensor that would be used to recognize the user's face in place of fingerprint recognition. So none of this is outside the realm of possibility."

The feature will be available indefinitely so that those affected by the coronavirus pandemic have an easier time staying afloat.
The button displays prominently in blue above the user’s bio, so fans are unlikely to miss it. Above the button, some text makes it clear that this initiative is meant to support those facing hardships during the coronavirus pandemic: “The COVID-19 virus has impacted the creative community around the world. Show support for your favorite creators.” This strategy could be effective because fans don’t have to buy music to support their favorite bands.

If Disney's going to experiment with putting a high-budget flick on the platform, now is the perfect time to do so when streaming services are getting even more popular.

Companies based in Santa Clara County, California which includes Cupertino, Mountain View, Palo Alto, and San Jose should avoid travel and postpone or cancel mass gatherings, the county recommended on Thursday. The recommendations come after six new cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified, bringing the total number of people confirmed to have the disease to 20.
The countys guidance affects several major Silicon Valley employers. Apple, for instance, is headquartered in Cupertino; Google in Mountain View; Tesla, in Palo Alto; Netflix, in Los Gatos; LinkedIn, in Sunnyvale; Adobe, in San Jose; and Intel and Nvidia, in Santa Clara. Other companies with offices in the area might be affected as well, such as Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. 
The recommendation comes after six new cases of the coronavirus were identified
Other guidance from the county includes minimizing the number of people working within arms length of one another, urging people to stay home if theyre sick, and spacing out start and end times of the workday for employees. People at higher risk for serious illness those who are over 50 or have another underlying health condition should stay home.
The county recommendations are an attempt to slow the spread of the new coronavirus by limiting in-person contact. Many of the tech companies based in the area the valley in Silicon Valley referred originally to the Santa Clara Valley have already made their own attempts to curb the diseases spread. 
Here are the policies The Verge is aware of that are in place by Santa Clara County-based companies:

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Amazon has pledged new health protections for its workers in fulfillment centers in the US and Europe, as first reported by Reuters. Under the new system, workers will receive a no-contact temperature check on arrival, and anyone who tests over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) will be sent home. Workers will also receive surgical masks for use while on the premises. The protections are planned to be in place by next week.
The Verge can confirm that warehouse workers from at least two sites have been informed of the new protections, some as early as Tuesday.
Amazon also plans to monitor on-site video feeds using software algorithms to ensure workers are appropriately distanced in the workplace, addressing previous concerns about overcrowding.
The new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: 
Amazons fulfillment teams have grown increasingly concerned about the lack of health protections at warehouse sites, which many believe is putting them at risk amid an unprecedented surge in demand. At one Detroit warehouse, management failed to notify employees when a co-worker tested positive for COVID-19 and was slow to respond when a second employee also tested positive. 
Amazon has seen a series of escalating labor actions in response to those failures. Workers in Staten Island and Chicago have staged walkouts to demand better health protections, and workers in Detroit were preparing for a similar action on Monday. Amazon did not respond when asked if the new measures were a response to those labor actions.
The new protections will also extend to the Whole Foods grocery chain, which Amazon acquired in 2017. Whole Foods workers had staged a walkout on Monday over similar concerns, also facing unprecedented supply chain disruption and grocery demand.
The new measures do not entirely protect workers from contracting COVID-19 at work, given the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission and the global shortage of more comprehensive protective equipment, like N95 masks. But in the absence of widely available testing, these new policies represent a significant improvement over previous conditions.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency has been ""closely monitoring"" the medical product supply chain ""with the expectation"" that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus would ""likely"" have an impact.
""A manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list,"" Hahn said in a statement Thursday night. ""The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug.""
""It is important to note that there are other alternatives that can be used by patients,"" he added. ""We are working with the manufacturer as well as other manufacturers to mitigate the shortage. We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage.""
Hahn said the issue continues to be ""an evolving and very dynamic"" one.
The newly identified virus, known officially as COVID-19, emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan back in December and has since spread overseas to at least 46 other nations, with South Korea, Italy and Iran seeing recent surges in case numbers. The World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a global health emergency and said the virus has ""pandemic potential,"" recorded more than 82,000 confirmed infections globally by Thursday. More than 95% of those cases were in China.
At least 2,804 people have died from confirmed cases of the virus, all but 57 in China, according to the latest data from the WHO.
So far in the United States, 60 people have been diagnosed with the disease. The majority of the cases are Americans who were on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was placed under quarantine in Japanese waters as hundreds of passengers became infected with the new coronavirus.
The newest case is being investigated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as possibly the first instance of ""community spread"" on American soil.
The patient, who is a resident of California's Solano County, had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual, according to the California Department of Public Health. The individual was transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento on Wednesday, the hospital confirmed.
It's the first COVID-19 case of unknown origin in the U.S., indicating there could be ""community spread,"" which means the virus is circulating among the local community and infecting people, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected, according to the CDC.
The CDC said it would continue to investigate the source of the infection. It's ""possible"" that the individual ""may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected,"" an agency official said in a statement Wednesday.
COVID-19 causes symptoms similar to pneumonia, ranging from the mild, such as a slight cough, to the more severe, including fever and difficulty breathing, according to the CDC. There is no vaccine yet for the virus.
The FDA said Thursday that it is ""not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.""
Meanwhile, a whistleblower within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has filed a complaint alleging that more than a dozen workers were sent to receive the first Americans repatriated from Wuhan, China, without proper training or protective gear for coronavirus infection control. The complaint, filed to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, was first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday.
ABC News has not reviewed the complaint, and lawyers representing the whistleblower have refused to provide it. However, Ari Wilkenfeld, one of the whistleblower's attorneys, told ABC News that the article by The Washington Post accurately describes the allegations laid out in the complaint. ""We are hopeful that Congress and the OSC will investigate this case in a timely and comprehensive manner,"" Wilkenfeld told ABC News in a statement. ""This matter concerns HHS's response to the coronavirus, and its failure to protect its employees and potentially the public. The retaliatory efforts to intimidate and silence our client must be opposed.""
Moreover, a spokesperson for the U.S. Office of Special Counsel confirmed to ABC News that they have received the whistleblower's complaint as described in The Washington Post, and that the case has been assigned.
When asked for comment, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Caitlin Oakley told ABC News: ""We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time.""

DoorDash will be reducing commission fees by 50 percent for orders placed on DoorDash and DoorDash-owned Caviar for all of its local restaurant partners, the company announced on Thursday. The commission relief program will begin on Monday, April 13th and run through the end of May.
The program will benefit more than 150,000 local restaurants in Australia, Canada, and the US, DoorDash says. DoorDash defines a local restaurant as one with five or fewer locations.
The program will benefit more than 150,000 restaurants
DoorDash CEO Tony Xu said this is an injection of up to $100 million, but it appears the company isnt actually giving anyone money directly, as that dollar amount seemingly represents the accumulated total of reduced commissions.
Heres an example to help demonstrate what that means. If a local restaurant previously paid a $2.50 commission to DoorDash on an order, it would now pay $1.25 because of the reduced commission rate announced today. The $1.25 that the restaurant didnt pay because of the reduced commission rate would count toward that $100 million figure. However, even if the total value of reduced commissions exceeds $100 million before the end of May, the reduced commissions program would continue, DoorDash confirmed to The Verge.

This isnt the first program DoorDash has launched to ease the financial burden on its restaurant partners during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company announced on March 17th that DoorDash and Caviar partners wouldnt have to pay commission fees on pickup orders. The company also said that independent restaurants in Australia, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US could sign up for DoorDash and Caviar for free and pay no commissions for 30 days.
DoorDash is also working to provide assistance to its delivery couriers by offering up to two weeks of sick pay if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 or if they have to quarantine themselves at the direction of public health officials, the company told The Vergeon March 10th. DoorDash has also given out hand sanitizer, gloves, and wipes to its couriers and said on April 3rd that it had ordered more than two million consumer-grade face masks to distribute to couriers."

The Super Tuesday primaries -- where nearly a third of delegates are up for grabs -- are run at the state and local level, and currently, a uniform national response to voter disruptions does not exist.
When asked about contingency plans, the communications director for the National Association of Secretaries of State said she'd ""defer to states,"" as each may administer its own ""specific plans"" for emergency preparedness.
""Whether that's a hurricane, power outage, et cetera,"" Maria Benson told ABC News in a statement.
In California, one of the most populous states with the highest number of delegates at stake on Tuesday, new cases of COVID-19 have election officials working hard to address the scale of the problem and how it may impact voters going to the polls.
While there were ""no indications of any disruptions to Californias March 3, 2020 presidential primary,"" the California Secretary of States office told ABC News it will continue to monitor any public health alerts that could impact election administration.
The state has more than 30 positive COVID-19 cases with over 8,400 individuals being monitored for possible contact with the virus after the first suspected instance of community transmission occurred in Solano County, according to officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California government and public health officials.
On Wednesday, the CDC confirmed the diagnosis of a woman from Northern California who was the first American to contract the disease without traveling internationally or being in close contact with anyone who was infected.
Since then, other cases of ""community spread"" in the U.S. have been confirmed in California, Oregon and Washington -- where public health officials in the state announced the first known death of a U.S. patient from the virus on Saturday.
Officials in Solano County, California are now taking precautionary measures and providing expanded options for voters, including offering an additional location for them to drop off ballots in advance of Super Tuesday.
""We have a bunch of curbside locations where [voters] dont even have to get out of their car and were going to expand that on Monday and Tuesday,"" said John Gardner, the assistant registrar of voters for Solano County.
Greeters, who are also sworn-in officials, will be on site to take ballots directly from voters vehicles and deposit them into a portable, sealed ballot box that will be within the persons sight from their vehicle.
Gardner told ABC News every polling place and every poll worker will receive disinfectant wipes and spray, hand sanitizer and gloves as additional precautions. In the past, only sanitary wipes were provided to clean the voting equipment itself.
""Were definitely trying to give voters another couple of options to still get their vote out but not have to interact, if they didnt want to, with the public,"" Gardner said.
In Yolo County, California where a patient is being treated at the UC Davis Medical Center after testing positive for COVID-19, election officials are teaming up with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase messaging efforts related to the threat of coronavirus before and during the upcoming primaries.
ABC News received a flyer from the Yolo County Elections office -- one that will be posted at every polling location -- that provides voters with details on what the coronavirus is and how its spread, and gives advice for how to potentially avoid catching the virus.
The Trump administration also raised the stakes in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the country after the first U.S. death from the virus.
The president held a press conference at the White House Saturday where he announced new travel restrictions pertaining to Iran and authorized the State Department to raise travel advisories to the highest level for the most heavily impacted regions in Italy and South Korea.
Outside of California, representatives from other Super Tuesday states told ABC News they havent seen new changes being implemented to their primary efforts.
""Its pretty much business as usual,"" said Steve Hurlbert, the communications director for the Colorado Secretary of State, when asked about potential election contingency plans relating to the novel coronavirus.
""Most of our ballots are mail-in-ballots,"" Hurlbert told ABC News. ""So, most people who arent feeling well can just vote their ballot and then drop it in a 24-hour drop box and never have to interact with another human being.""
Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill too said no new changes were being made ahead of the states primary, but told ABC News accommodations would be made if circumstances were to change.
Merrill said its important for people to follow the lead of state health officials when it comes to anything involving the coronavirus or other crisis-level health concerns.
""People dont need to be out on their own, as if they are a lone ranger in this fight,"" Merrill told ABC News on Wednesday. ""It needs to be a coordinated effort and we will continue to follow the lead of the governor and our state health officer, as well as the Alabama Department of Public Health in regard to this issue.""
As the primary season barrels towards the general election in November, safety remains the top priority for officials in the event the Democratic convention takes place amid a more widespread outbreak of the disease.
""Our number one concern is to ensure all eligible voters are able to make their voices heard without jeopardizing anyones health and safety,"" Maya Hixson, the deputy director of battleground state communications for the Democratic National Committee, told ABC News on Thursday.
""We will continue to closely monitor as the situation develops,"" she said.
ABC News' Rick Klein, Dick Sheffield, Gabrielle Sarann, Matthew Fuhrman and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report."

Many of us are understandably feeling pretty anxious about the new coronavirus (COVID-19), as the world battles a global health challenge with little idea of what lies ahead. 
When words fail us, emoji often do the job just as well. Emojipedia a website dedicated to keeping you up to date on all the latest emoji news and updates analysed a set of 12 health-related emoji to see which one was most commonly associated with discussions of coronavirus. 
The two most popular emoji used in discussions were (known as ""Face with Medical Mask"") and (known as the Microbe). 
Keith Broni a behavioural scientist who's just been appointed Deputy Emoji Officer at Emojipedia told Mashable that he and his colleague Jeremy Burge (Chief Emoji Officer) spotted a pattern among Emojipedia users, and were curious to see if it was also playing out across Twitter. They decided to conduct a data analysis to investigate further. 
""Specifically, Jeremy had noted that the Microbe emoji and the Face With Medical Mask emoji were experiencing a significant increase in page views following the widespread coverage of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus,"" Broni said. ""We found a significant proportion of tweets featuring the Microbe and the Face With Medical Mask were indeed related to the coronavirus 42 percent and 36 percent respectively.""
 Microbe and Face With Medical Mask have both seen a considerable rise alongside the global spread of COVID-19, according to Emojipedia page view data. 
Face with Head-Bandage is used as a control in this data set, and shows no similar increase. pic.twitter.com/kn4tfh5ywI
 Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) March 11, 2020
Broni noticed that all the other medical emojis only explicitly referenced COVID-19 in five percent or less of the tweets they selected, which indicated that the microbe and medical-mask-face emoji are ""by far and away the two emojis being most commonly used in reference to the disease.""
SEE ALSO: Inside the red zone: Photos show dramatic impact of Italy's coronavirus lockdown
So what other emoji, outside of the health-related set, are being used in discussions around coronavirus?
""In terms of what people are attempting to express with emojis when discussing COVID-19, there is definitely a significant sense of concern mixed in with the usual irreverence of the internet,"" said Broni. 
""The latter can be see by the fact that the Crying Laughing Face was the #1 emoji in our 'COVID-19' tweet sample, reflecting people expressing amusement or perhaps awkward laughter in reaction to the spread of the disease (like with all major news stories, there've been quite a few Coronavirus memes doing the rounds).""
Finally, there is also some evidence to suggest people are using emoji as a means of warning others.
""The relative increase of lesser used 'warning' emojis such as the Red Circle, Police Car Light and Warning indicates that people are attempting to alert or warn one another regarding the spread of coronavirus and quite likely circulate the behaviours we all need to adopt to slow down its spread,"" Broni said. 
COVID-19 has now infected over 115,000 people worldwide. 4,200 people have been killed."

Social distancing, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the practice of maintaining at least three feet of distance between you and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. It's just one measure being suggested to protect against the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus. 
Many people even health officials have started using handshake alternatives. And France has even told citizens to stop participating in ""bise,"" the very French practice of kissing each other on the cheek. 
Given that handshakes and kisses are being curtailed and working remotely is being encouraged, single people may wonder if they should ""social distance"" themselves from dates and simply stay home. 
Tinder got ahead of the curve, creating a pop-up with health safety reminders and linked to information from WHO:

While pop-ups haven't shown up (yet) on other dating apps, a spokesperson from Bumble pointed out its voice call and video chat feature, should people not want to meet up in person. 
Dr. Natasha Fuksina, Diplomate of American Board of Internal Medicine, also suggested Skype or FaceTime if it's a first date and you have some reservations. ""It will lessen some of the fears and help build trust and a relationship going forward,"" she told Mashable. 
Dr. Taylor Graber, an anesthesiology resident at the San Diego with University of California San Diego, said that dating does not need to stop because of COVID-19. ""I do not believe we need to shut down dating amid the coronavirus. In young, healthy adults, there is a very low risk of contracting serious consequences of the illness,"" he said in an email to Mashable. 
SEE ALSO: Kids quarantined in Wuhan found a brilliant way to get out of schoolwork
Common sense, however, still applies. If you have viral symptoms such as fever, cough, cold, and runny nose, that's when you should definitely avoid dating and kissing others, according to Graber. Fuksina agreed, citing the CDC and WHO guidelines.
And if you're already in an established relationship? The same rules apply. Fuksina also noted that it's important to be mindful of your partner's concerns. Graber emphasized that honestly is necessary; if you do not feel well, postpone your date will understand, especially now. 
So, if you are not sick and want to continue to date, go for it. Just don't bail and use the coronavirus as an excuse; we all know you could've just FaceTimed instead."

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more people worldwide are confined to their homes in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. The practice of social distancing avoiding crowded places, maintaining at least six feet of space between individuals, and staying home is an effective, but boring method of containing the virus. Naturally, those who are home are turning to snacking to fill their days.
It's a stressful time for everyone, but especially for those who have a complicated relationship with food. 
My disordered eating began in high school, and in the decade since, I've learned to develop a healthy mindset when it comes to food. Being physically active and eating when I felt hungry taught me that eating regularly would keep me strong. 
When my gym closed last week to contribute to ""flattening the curve"" and limit the risk of overwhelming our healthcare system, I briefly panicked over the climbing skills I'd lose. I worried that the strength I gained over the last year would be undone with just a few weeks of being stuck in my small Los Angeles apartment. I worried that without regular hiking and climbing, my mental health would slip. Most of all, I worried that I'd be bored. 
But I didn't worry about my weight until I saw other Twitter users joking about gaining the ""quarantine 15."" 
SEE ALSO: 'Quarantine with Me' is the perfect coronavirus ballad
""Social distancing has an element of isolation,"" Ashley Lytwyn said in a phone call to Mashable. She's a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) and the Executive Director of Breathe Life Healing Center, an eating disorder treatment clinic in West Hollywood. ""It's this fear provoking time, and then putting pressure on people [by] saying, 'Oh my god, you're going to gain so much weight because you're in isolation,' or that you're going to eat all your quarantine snacks in one night...that can be scary for people that have dealt with eating disorders."" 
I'm privileged in that I have a therapist who I can see once a week via video calls, the financial stability to be able to stock up on food, and a job that keeps me occupied while I'm stuck at home. I also have a supportive roommate who reminds me that I need to eat regularly, even though I'm not as physically active as I usually am. Worrying over body image was a fleeting thought, but for others, it can be all-encompassing. For many struggling with disordered eating, seeing jokes about weight gain, binging on snacks, or restricting eating to avoid body changes is incredibly triggering. 
Other Twitter users noted how upsetting it is to see jokes body-shaming weight gain during an already stressful time. 
please stop making jokes about gaining the covid 15. people with eating disorders exist and were struggling during this time. dont be an asshole.
 Elly Belle (@literElly) March 18, 2020
I can't believe I have to say this in 2020 but PLEASE stop joking about/talking about gaining weight during quarantine on social media, you're triggering people who are already in isolation AND it's really lame!!!! FaceTime a friend or something!!! pic.twitter.com/QCXvFf0GvQ

I am seeing lots of carb-shaming in peoples posts about COVID grocery stockpiling and dear lord, can we just agree that if there was ever a time to eat pasta, it has arrived?
 Virginia Sole-Smith (@v_solesmith) March 15, 2020
Lytwyn noted that eating disorders often stem from a need to control something, and that those who have a history or are currently struggling with them may relapse because the world feels so out of control right now. Learning to get comfortable with eating regularly also involves consistent access to food and working with RDNs to establish a healthy meal plan. Panic-buying and stocking up on groceries can threaten that. 
""Going to a grocery store and seeing empty shelves [and] no longer having access to food, it's almost like scarcity, which can also trigger eating disorder behaviors,"" Lytwyn said.
Seeing content about the need to stay fit to avoid gaining weight during quarantine or social distancing can also be triggering for eating disorder recovery. While staying active is important right now, so is treating your body with compassion. 
""You exercise program and routine is going to look not like it typically does, and we have to be flexible with that,"" Lytwyn said. 
Being inside doesn't mean that you have to be sedentary; there are plenty of ways to stay active while being cooped up in the house. But you don't need to feel pressured to stay a certain size. Again, we're living through an unprecedented pandemic, and that's terrifying. If there's any time to treat yourself with kindness, it's now. 
If you do want to exercise at home, Lytwyn suggests following fitness instructors who use body positive language think phrases like ""strength building"" instead of ""calorie burning."" There's nothing wrong with wanting to maintaining a workout routine, as long as you're doing it with a healthy mindset. 
Fitness instructors like yoga teacher Irene Pappas, trainer Kaisa Keranen, and dancer Jessie Diaz-Herrera all teach online fitness classes that focus on moving, not losing weight. They show it's possible to stay active without needing to feel guilty for not looking a certain way or being a certain shape. 
And when it comes to social media, feel free to joke about your changed eating habits. Just do it with sensitivity! You can still post about how much you're enjoying your snacking. Just keep the weight-related comments to yourself. 
""The reality is, this pandemic is affecting so many different people in so many different ways,"" Lytwyn concluded. ""Now is not the time to be insensitively joking about the circumstances that we're in."" 
If you feel like youd like to talk to someone about your eating behavior, call the National Eating Disorder Associations helpline at 800-931-2237. You can also text NEDA to 741-741 to be connected with a trained volunteer at theCrisis Text Line

In the moral paradox, a trolley's brakes stop working, and as it gathers speed it risks killing a group of people on the tracks and the trolley passengers. You happen to be standing next to a lever that would divert the trolley onto another path, where a single person is standing. You can't save both, so you have to decide between letting the trolley take its course and kill multiple people, or be responsible for killing one person to save the others. 
The United States is facing a parallel, but much less morally conflicting issue. The disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus continues to spread, despite multiple states mandating ""shelter in place"" and ""safer at home"" policies.

The stock market plummeted last week, and as Americans call on the federal government to pass relief packages for individuals in need, the Trump administration want to bail out the cruse and airline industry. Congress, meanwhile, is working on a $2 trillion stimulus package to float the country through the economic fallout.

Trump, meanwhile, is pushing businesses to reopen. During a town hall on Tuesday, he said he wants ""packed churches"" on Easter Sunday in less than three weeks, effectively undoing nationwide social distancing efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

You may have heard that fewer Americans may get sick and die from COVID-19 than previously estimated. According to leading projections namely from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington which has been referenced by the White House death estimates are now significantly lower than last week. As of April 9, the group now estimates 60,415 deaths by August, a stark drop from the 93,531 deaths projected a week ago. (This is just the first wave of deaths, and doesnt include a likely second wave of infections come fall).
This is, by all means, ""good news."" But, critically, the IHME assumes that current unprecedented social distancing efforts closed restaurants, schools, and beaches along with canceled professional sports, concerts, and pretty much everything else will remain in effect through the end of May, which could bring this grim wave of infections to a close by early June. Even then, life probably wont promptly return to normal. Well need mass-testing and a willingness to social distance when the virus inevitably pops up again.
Fewer projected deaths, then, doesnt mean we're out of the dark, pathogenic woods. Just the opposite. Because the U.S. government failed to start rigorous testing when the virus hit led by a president who said We have it totally under control in January and later proclaimed at a big campaign rally that the virus would just miraculously go away the microbial parasite couldnt be contained. Its everywhere. So an optimistic hope for fewer deaths, infections, and hospitalizations requires U.S. society to continue to commit to extreme social distancing.
""The more optimistic models for the impacts of COVID-19 on the healthcare system like the IHME model from the University of Washington assume a very high level of compliance with the various social distancing mandates that have been implemented by the governors as part of their emergency declarations,"" said Jennifer Horney, the director of the Epidemiology program in the College of Health Sciences at the University of Delaware.
Take it from Christopher Murray, the director of IHME. ""If social distancing measures are relaxed or not implemented, the US will see greater death tolls, the death peak will be later, the burden on hospitals will be much greater, and the economic costs will continue to grow,"" Murray said in a statement on Sunday.
The social distancing message for Americans, then, remains unchanged.
""Stick to it,"" said Henry Raymond, an associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health. ""I don't like to use military metaphors, but we don't want to declare victory too soon.""
""Social distancing is one of the only tools we have,"" emphasized Brian Labus, a professor in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Public Health. ""It's not like we have treatments. It's not like we have a vaccine."" (A vaccine is at best a year to 18 months away.)
Our projections for total US #COVID19 deaths dropped from 81,766 to 60,415. Why? Weve incorporated new data that indicates that deaths are going down. This drop may also signal that social distancing is working in the US. https://t.co/MxupsvDhPG

This is a make-or-break week in our battle against this virus: the time to cut back even on essential errands, to skip shopping if you have enough and just stay home.
We cant get complacent.
We cant let up in this fight.
 MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) April 8, 2020
The future projections, or models, of deaths and sickness from coronavirus are invaluable. They don't give perfect numbers they're not supposed to. But they give us a map of where we're headed. ""Were trying to get an idea of what we're up against,"" said Labus. ""Models give us a ballpark idea of where things are going.""
These models, of course, take a lot into account besides social distancing, and updated numbers about deaths and infections are very valuable to researchers. (IHME now tunes its U.S. projections based on how seven other places have successfully flattened their curve by using robust social distancing, like areas in Spain and Italy). IHME relies on incoming death rate numbers to project how many will die, and estimates how many people on average one infected person will infect, among other data.
Infectious disease models are challenging to make, especially for the insidious coronavirus, which often takes days to make someone sick. It might be a week before they have symptoms, another week before they get tested, and at least another week before this information gets to epidemic modelers. We're trying to get next week's weather by sitting in a closed room and looking at the weather three weeks ago,"" said Labus.
But social distancing is clearly a big driver of where countries are headed on the coronavirus highway. Research from the Imperial College of London found that 11 European countries with strong social distancing policies averted nearly 60,000 deaths in March in over just three weeks. In the U.S., the White House estimated on March 31 (with modeling from the likes of Harvard University, Columbia University, Northeastern University) that there would be between 1.5 and 2.2 million American deaths without social distancing measures but with social distancing and handwashing, they projected the much lower range of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths during the first infection wave of 2020.
""Stick to it.""
Social distancing measures are likely already having a big impact in the U.S. The number of hospitalizations is slowing in beleaguered New York City. This is not an act of God were looking at, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. Its an act of what society actually does. New Jersey is seeing a spike in deaths (from people who became infected weeks ago), but its growth in new hospitalizations has stalled. 
This suggests indirectly that social distancing is helping, said Rutgers Raymond, noting that theres no direct way to confirm social distancing is flattening the curve. But its quite likely, because many people are holed-up at home. They simply cant pass the virus which can spread just by talking at bars, work, and on the train.
The latest optimistic models, however, will miss certain social distancing lapses that may result in the spread of disease. Of note, Wisconsin held in-person primary elections amid the pandemic on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court allowed the election to proceed. Voters in Milwaukee waited in profoundly long lines while Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos donning a protective gown, mask, and gloves told voters it's ""incredibly safe"" to be out voting. What model could have predicted that? 
That was a huge 12-hour break of social distancing, said Amanda Simanek, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. We potentially derailed much of the social distancing we had been doing.
Wow (in a good way): In New York state, coronavirus hospitalizations have only gone up by 200 in the past 24 hours, Gov. Andrew Cuomo just announced. That's the smallest increase since March 18 pic.twitter.com/mziNVPnwue
 Brian M. Rosenthal (@brianmrosenthal) April 9, 2020
In its Wisconsin modeling, the IHME assumes the states stay-at-home orders and closure of non-essential businesses were occurring and will continue. 
Anywhere in the U.S., easing up on social distancing too early before the daily number of cases continually falls, before we can provide extensive testing, and before we develop the ability to rapidly test and isolate infected people will mean a rise in infections. Without these rigorous virus control efforts, the nations top infectious disease experts know the virus will reemerge and be difficult to contain when social distancing stops.  
The take-home message remains that when we begin to ease social distancing measures we will see an uptick in cases, said the University of Delawares Horney."

New genetic developments are coming everyday so fast that even the CDC can't keep up.  
During the latest coronavirus press conference Saturday, Dr. Deborah Birx shared new findings about the virus that may contradict what the CDC currently says about transmission. Birx, the highly experienced coronavirus response coordinator at the White House, said that there may be a group of people who are asymptomatic yet spreading the virus. 
Birx's task force of experts does not believe that people under 20 are immune from coronavirus, so they may have it and not show symptoms. ""Are they a group that are potentially asymptomatic and spreading the virus?"" Birx asked. ""Because of that unknown, we don't want to say that the risk is low when we don't know how low the numbers are for people who are asymptomatic."" 
SEE ALSO: Inside the red zone: Photos show dramatic impact of Italy's coronavirus lockdown
While the administration has been focused on those who are most at risk immunocompromised and the elderly there is another side of the pandemic, according to Birx: transmission. 
It is currently unknown how many people are asymptomatic and passing the virus along. That means that while the chance of serious illness is low, those who have it may not know it, andmay be spreading it far and wide as a result. 
This appears to be new information, given that the CDC says on their website that people who show symptoms are thought to be the most contagious. The website currently reads, ""Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."" 
The bottom line is this: Asymptomatic spread of coronavirus may be responsible for more cases than previously thought. More concrete information on Birx's report may yet roll out. Regardless, this is why it is so important for everyone, literally everyone, to practice the proper precautions, even if they do not show symptoms. 
""That's why we're asking every American to take personal responsibility to prevent that spread,"" Birx said. So wash your hands, don't touch your face, and social distance yourself already. Don't forget, we may be able to find out after the fact whether or not you spread it."

Brady Press Briefing Room, reporters sat spaced three seats apart at the day's coronavirus press briefing. Meanwhile, General Mark A. Milley (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the highest-ranking officer in the United States military), the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, President Donald Trump, and others crowded behind the lectern to provide Americans an update on the rapidly spreading coronavirus. 
These Coronavirus Task Force briefings, often indoors, have been occurring regularly for nearly a month, after starting in late February. An average of 8.5 million Americans tune in on TV, and the briefings are live-streamed on YouTube. Political, military, and public health leaders crowd into small areas, during a time when the CDC urges Americans to stay six feet from each other to avoid catching, or transmitting, the microbe.
Infectious disease experts say this public, televised crowding is a negligent show of public health behavior amid the pandemic, and gives irresponsible social distancing guidance to Americans. With a vaccine still about a year away at earliest, and testing still lagging far behind other nations, social distancing is a primary weapon in curbing the relentless spread of the coronavirus, which results in the respiratory disease COVID-19. 
""This is at a minimum sending the wrong and discordant messaging to the public,"" said Jason Farley, a nurse practitioner for the Division of Infectious Diseases AIDS Service at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. ""It is only a matter of time before one of them becomes ill with coronavirus given this behavior.""
""These people are supposed to be setting a good example and theyre not setting a good example for the nation,"" said epidemic expert Suzanne Willard, the associate dean of Global Health at Rutgers School of Nursing.
Other than living on surfaces, the coronavirus travels in respiratory drops that can spread when someone nearby sneezes, coughs or just talks. There's mounting evidence showing the virus can spread effectively in the air.
""It is possible for viruses to be released into the air from just talking and breathing,"" said Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech. ""It wouldn't be a lot, but the chance of those viruses landing on someone else or being inhaled by someone else is higher if people are closer together.""

White House staff and journalists entering the premises are now given temperature checks, to identify fever, before entering. But up to one in four people may carry the virus without ever showing any symptoms, and it takes an average of five days for an infected person to start showing any symptoms at all. Infected people may be attending these briefings.
Around the world, national leaders like UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Iran's Deputy Health Minister, the UK Health Secretary, and the Prince of Monaco have tested positive.
At a minimum, the coronavirus task force should underscore, through their actions, that social distancing to curb the spread of disease is critical for everyone.
""You should lead by example,"" said Sharona Hoffman, a professor of both bioethics and law at Case Western Reserve University.
""It would be good if they took better precautions, wore masks, and went on stage one at a time,"" Hoffman said.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force is expected on Friday to recommend Americans now wear face masks in public. 
""You should lead by example.""
If multiple leaders insist on being onstage at once, they should give each other ample space.
""I think our leaders should model social distancing by standing at least six feet apart during press briefings,"" said Virginia Tech's Marr.
Farley, of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, recommends going even further. 
""[The briefings] should be moved online with the President and his advisors NOT in the room,"" said Farley, advocating for ending these close-quartered, daily press room interactions. He noted that while reporters in chairs are appropriately spaced six feet apart, on the White House stage these rules go out the window. 
The virus doesn't discriminate. Even Anthony Fauci, the venerated director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has become the nation's de facto coronavirus leader and calming truth-speaker, could be exposed. 
""If Tony Fauci gets sick, that would be catastrophic,"" said Hoffman.

A stranger in Los Angeles asked me this over the phone as I peered out of my bedroom window in Brooklyn. We connected through QuarantineChat
, which facilitates calls for people who are currently self-isolating. 
Now that the coronavirus has reached pandemic level, many countries have instituted lockdowns
; those in the United States are heavily encouraged to stay indoors and flatten the curve
. With self-isolation causing people to be apart from their loved ones, coupled with the anxiety of the whole situation, it's easy for loneliness to seep into everyday life. 
Some are getting creative to combat loneliness, however. Enter QuarantineChat, which was created by artists Danielle Baskin
 and Max Hawkins
. QuarantineChat is a feature in their app Dialup
, which calls people at set (or random, in the case of QuarantineChat) times to chat one-on-one. 
I've had several ""quarantine chats"" so far, including the one with the stranger from Los Angeles. Here's how it works: I downloaded the Dialup app and opted in for QuarantineChat. Every day, they call me and facilitate pairing me with someone else. With every call comes the same prompt: to look outside our window and describe what's there. I told her I was in Brooklyn, and outside was not the norm of cars driving by and folks chatting outside their homes, but instead occasional single walkers. 
SEE ALSO: The movies we're watching on repeat while social distancing
She asked about stoops because stoop culture, the act of shooting the shit on one's stoop, doesn't really exist in LA. I told her that yes, there are stoops and usually people sitting on them, but not in the past week. The call reminded me of conversations I have when I'm on vacation, chatting with folks about our hometowns.
Dialup itself launched in 2019 as a way for Baskin and Hawkins to have check-ins with their self-employed friends. Now, the app connects friends as well as communities, companies, and conferences through random calls. Beyond QuarantineChat, Dialup has many themed options for calls everything from talking about your breakfast, memories, and the full moon. There are even calls where people can read poems or tarot cards to each other. 
Some of Dialup's non-quarantine offerings.

As self-quarantine and isolation took hold, Baskin and Hawkins thought their app would be of use to people. ""In the last week of February, we heard so many stories about people in quarantine and self-isolation,"" they wrote in an emailed statement to Mashable. ""We thought our app would be great to combat feelings of disconnection."" 
Due to isolation, people aren't having the same daily small talk, say with their barista. ""We hope our project brings magic and serendipity to a new reality where hundreds of thousands of people might be stuck inside for the next month,"" Baskin and Hawkins said. 
My quarantine chats have all been pleasant and with pleasant people. Considering that this is a stressful time for us all and that we're all on the internet to begin with it was a welcome reprieve and a nice surprise that it has not devolved into ChatRoulette territory. 
Rather, my calls have been with people interested in my life and how I'm taking this whole situation, and in turn I hear their stories. Their careers ranged from helping the homeless to marketing to design. I even followed one on Twitter. These connections serve as a nice reminder that even though I'm physically alone, everyone including strangers across the continent are going through the same thing.

Baskin and Hawkins told me they've received heartwarming anecdotes from people using QuarantineChat and Dialup from all over the world. People from places such as Madrid, Berlin, and Tennessee are sharing experiences with each other. ""It's been beautiful to get these glimpses into lives from the first-person perspective,"" they said.

How long social distancing will last is still up in the air, but people are already making efforts to connect be it over FaceTime

Thunberg, who famously travels without planes to engage in her climate activism, quarantined herself for the last two weeks after returning from a trip around Central Europe, according to her post. She began feeling symptoms ""around ten days ago."" Her father, who also experienced similar symptoms, found his symptoms to be much more acute.  
In Sweden, where Thunberg lives, testing for COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the coronavirus, is prioritized for hospitalized patients and those who work in healthcare or elderly care, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The Public Health Agency of Sweden says that anyone ill with flu or cold symptoms should stay at home, and that this group will not be prioritized for testing. Consequently, Thunberg was not tested.

The last two weeks Ive stayed inside. When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless youre in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but its extremely likely that Ive had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now Ive basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didnt feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they dont know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups. We who dont belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need. #COVID #flattenthecurve

She writes that she has ""basically recovered,"" and that while experiencing her symptoms she ""almost didn't feel ill"" which is exactly what Thunberg wants her followers to understand. 
Without her dad experiencing similar symptoms, Thunberg says that she ""might not have suspected anything."" 
She continues: ""And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they dont know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups."" 
In the U.S., some young people, like those who packed Florida beaches for spring break, have shown flagrant disregard for the World Health Organization's recommendations. Although young people are less at risk, no one is invulnerable when it comes to COVID-19.

This isn't the first time that Thunberg asked for young people to unite behind the science (in the context of COVID-19). Prior to her personal announcement, Thunberg also called for climate strikes to move online, stressing that young people practice social distancing for ""the best interest of our common society."""

This is a text Caitlin, a woman living in Seattle, received from an ex-hookup last week. Caitlin, who requested to use a different name in this article for privacy reasons, declined because she felt sick; even though she resides in the state with the first US case of coronavirus
, she could not be tested for coronavirus.
When Caitlin said she wasn't feeling well and couldn't receive a test, the ex-hookup replied, ""I'll wear a plastic bag.""
This is a crude example, but it's just one of many texts from exes that've popped up amid the coronavirus. COVID-19, the disease that results from the virus, has ground life to a halt across the world. The lockdowns that pervade countries in Asia and Europe are now coming for the United States, with San Francisco instating shelter-in-place
 for the next few weeks and other cities considering following its lead.

With every aspect of this crisis how many people will be impacted, how much time it will take to return to normalcy, how normalcy will even look afterwards up in the air, anxieties are seemingly at an all-time high. Coupled with isolation as people are urged or forced to stay home and flatten the curve
, we've got a recipe for a cooped-up, bored, and stressed out population.
Which is to say: everyone is horny, and beyond furiously (or mindfully!) masturbating there's no quick fix. This unique time we're living in has led to a phenomenon of exes of all stripes coming out of the woodwork.
This unique time we're living in has led to a phenomenon of exes of all stripes coming out of the woodwork.
Not only is Caitlin one of many people this happened to, but she's also not the only Seattleite that reached out to me. Jules, a 28-year-old in Seattle who requested using her first-name because she ""doesn't want him [her ex] googling her,"" had two exes reach out to her. One, from high school, sent her a handwritten letter and a follow-up text.
Jules was sick the first week of March, so she was quarantined longer than most and wonders if that's why she's more open to these conversations. ""He even used nice stationary so I bought stationary to write back,"" Jules told me, ""now that I've finished all of Love is Blind and 90 Day Fiancé I'm invested in this saga."" 
But it's not just boredom that's causing exes to resurrect themselves. ""It makes a lot of sense to me, because isolation is real,"" said Rachel DeAlto, Match's chief dating expert, ""and loneliness is real.""
Millennials and Generation Z report more loneliness
 than previous generations to begin with, and now we're all stuck in our homes. We want someone to talk to, someone who could relate. ""We find ourselves falling back into old patterns for comfort and communication,"" DeAlto said in an interview with Mashable. 
When something of this magnitude happens, we have the desire to cling to what we know. Exes may be taking this opportunity to experience or at least, attempt to experience the same positive emotions they had when they were in the past relationship. ""This person made me feel good at some point,"" said DeAlto, describing the mindset people may be in, ""and this connection felt good and I'm searching for things that feel good right now when I'm anxious about so much else.""
What's more is that the stakes are low. There is no pressure to actually make an effort to see someone, because we're all required to stay home.

Isolation has apparently been enough to bring up thoughts of long-ago exes. Melissa A Vitale, a 27-year-old publicist living in Brooklyn, said an ex she had not spoken to for six years reached out. 
The ex was apparently just sending a friendly check-in, but Vitale was not buying it. ""He was obviously baiting me to ask about him but I refused so it didn't go on,"" Vitale told Mashable. ""It was not a good breakup so I had no intention of diving into that simply because he has more time on his hands without work.""
And, unsurprisingly, more recent exes are not afraid to enter the fray either. Abbigail, a woman who lives in Chicago, had an ex from 2019 reach out.

They'd dated from April to September of last year, and while they were in contact in January, Abbigail cut it off again. The ex texted her in the past week, having seen a former workplace of hers was going through layoffs. They had agreed to meet several days later, but neither followed up (and by then, the pressure to stay in had already bubbled up online). ""Just gonna let it die,"" Abbigail told me. 
Not everyone had their ex contact them. Some people, like 28-year-old Lisa, did the reaching out themselves. Her friends were talking about what shows they were binging now that everyone is inside. One mentioned 'The Jinx,' which Lisa watched with her ex. She reached out, and then they made small talk about current events.

""We still reconnect from time to time,"" said the Montreal resident, who requested first-name only for privacy reasons. ""Mostly Instagram DMs but for some reason a text seemed appropriate now.""
Further, people from past casual relationships or even just a few dates are reaching out. ""Not an ex,"" 28-year-old Brendan told me, ""but a guy I went on three dates with and then he ghosted me for 6 months started texting me again last week."" 
The guy in question is a teacher, and their conversations petered out when the school year kicked in last September. Coincidentally, the teacher texted Brendan the same time as schools were closing nationwide due to the coronavirus
.
""He texted me right before schools were closed,"" Brendan said. ""Part of me feels like a clown for talking to him again after he ghosted me. But our dates were great and Ive never had a hard time talking with him.""

While the teacher is stuck at home, Brendan was still going in his office and working 60 hours a week when we spoke.
DeAlto believes the urge to reconnect, on either side, is indicative of these uncertain times. ""People who aren't anxious are anxious right now,"" she said. When so much is unknown, there is a pull to what you do know to the past, when everything seemed ""normal,"" and to the person that you had good times with. That desire to reach out (or answer) is an emotional response to whatever trigger is in front of us, according to DeAlto. We all seem to have the same trigger at the moment: the coronavirus, and everything to do with it. 
SEE ALSO: Don't despair about being single while social distancing. Here's why.
But letting nostalgia and the desire for normalcy take over can be detrimental if it results in reconnecting with toxic people. If that is the case, DeAlto suggests having a plan in place for what to do when that desire hits. You can FaceTime a friend, take a walk around the block, do a puzzle something to take your mind off this toxic ex. 
While we aren't yet certain when, there will eventually be an end to social distancing and the coronavirus. The anxiety may seem overbearing in this moment, but the choices you make may not be in your best interest in a post-COVID-19 world. Think twice before responding to your ex or before texting them first. 
Brendan has been keeping up correspondence with the teacher for a week now. ""Feels like we picked up where we left off,"" he said. ""Weve talked that we will probably see each other once the COVID-19 stuff passes."""

You can get the news faster than ever before by relentlessly refreshing your Twitter timeline, which can be a blessing and a curse during the coronavirus pandemic. 
We all probably know someone who is stressing themselves out right now by anxiously scrolling Twitter all day. If you find yourself doing this, please know that there are ways to stop. Whether it's asking friends for help or using a time management app, it's totally possible to cut down on your Twitter time.
Why do we do this to ourselves?
The last time I went out with friends was in early March, right before it became clear that was no longer a safe thing to do. A lull in the conversation led to one of us looking at Twitter only to see the breaking news that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had tested positive for Covid-19. Suddenly, everyone pulled out their phones to see it for themselves, only to see just a few minutes later that the NBA had postponed play indefinitely because of Rudy Gobert's positive diagnosis. 
Those news items pale in comparison to what's happened since, but the way they dominated Twitter made them feel cataclysmic. Despite this, we couldn't stop refreshing our timelines. Dr. Anna Lembke is an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford who specializes in addiction. She broke down why some of us feel the need to do this even when we know it's not great for our mental health. 
These are stressful times and Twitter makes it more stressful sometimes.

SEE ALSO: 7 ways to help quell coronavirus-related anxiety
Whats kind of happened is that we all in our day to day lives ... struggle with free-floating anxiety, and we manage that in a variety of different ways,"" Lembke said. ""A lot of our usual coping strategies are no longer available to us.""
In other words, those of us who used things like sports or pop culture to get through each day can't do that anymore. Obsessively tracking baseball statistics turned into obsessively tracking the coronavirus case counter. 
""Somehow they're in this compulsive vortex""
There is nothing wrong with being informed. But on Twitter, a lot of information ends up being redundant since many people spread the same tweets at once. Since we don't know what else to do, we might keep doing it no matter how bad it makes us feel.
That phenomenon does happen where it just becomes kind of like a bottomless pit where people just keep going with it even when its not new information, it's not useful information, it causes them to be anxious, and yet somehow theyre in this compulsive vortex,"" Lembke said.
Abstain if you can, when you can
The obvious solution to Twitter stress is to just not look at it. That's easier said than done, though, as it's a valuable source of socialization, news, and even income for many of its users. If you can't just delete Twitter from your life, what can you do to mitigate the anxiety that comes from looking at it?
Lembke recommended a kind of measured abstinence from Twitter. Don't cut it out wholesale. Maybe take 24 hours off to see how you feel, and if that works for you, identify a day each week to do a ""digital detox,"" as Lembke called it. If a full day is too much, maybe give yourself a ""no Twitter after 8 p.m."" rule on weeknights or something to that effect.
You might find that you can still stay adequately informed about the pandemic by just honing in on a few trusted news sources instead of succumbing to Twitter's information overload. If Twitter is one of the primary ways you interact with your friends, it might help to make this measured abstinence a group effort.
Just like the way that sheltering in place is a lot easier to do because you know the whole rest of the globe is doing it at the same time, its much easier to stay off of Twitter if people in your circle are doing it at the same time,"" Lembke said.
Temporarily ditch the group DM for a Zoom call, or something like Zoom that's more secure. Finding a way to have something resembling face-to-face interactions with your Twitter pals is imperative right now. 
There are tech solutions, too
Give yourself some time away from the phone.
Image: alex perry / mashable
Real quick, we have to acknowledge that Twitter allows you to mute words and phrases from appearing on your timeline. If you want to avoid coronavirus news altogether, that's one way to do it. If you still want to follow the news on Twitter but can't make yourself take breaks, you can actually make your phone do it for you. 
Anyone who has an iPhone has probably noticed those Screen Time notifications that implicitly shame you on Sunday mornings for how much they've used their phones. Well, if you go into your iPhone's settings, Screen Time has its own little section (in same area as Notifications and Do Not Disturb) where you can set a period of downtime each day. During that period, you can only make phone calls and use apps that you approve of beforehand. 
Screen Time also allows you to set time limits for specific apps. Maybe you only want to give yourself two hours of Twitter a day, for example. Android users aren't left out of this, by the way, as Screen Time is on the Google Play Store.
Android folks can also take advantage of Off the Grid, which is a more aggressive version of the same idea. You give it a time when you want to be away from your phone and it'll not only lock you out, but auto-reply to anyone who tries to message you. Try to access your phone during off-limits hours and you'll have to either pay a $1 fee or watch an ad. 
That might be a bit much, but just know that there are ways to force yourself to stop looking at Twitter. Next time you feel that pang of anxiety in your stomach while scrolling through the infernal timeline, think about taking some steps to stop it from happening again."

The flamboyant 55-year-old leader’s visible decline shook the nation, but he came out of three nights of intensive care at St Thomas’ Hospital after going in with a high temperature and cough. 
“He must rest up,” his father Stanley Johnson told BBC radio, thanking Britons for their outpouring of support and telling them to heed the lesson. “If it can hit the prime minister for heaven’s sake, well it does come close to home.” 
Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain’s situation worsened drastically. 
The death toll is 7,978 - the fifth highest in the world. 
“You cannot walk away from this and go straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment,” Stanley Johnson added. 
The prime minister’s Downing Street office said he was in the “early phase” of recovery and it was unclear how long he would be in hospital. But his improvement cheered Britain and beyond, U.S. President Donald Trump hailing the “great news.” 
Johnson’s pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds, who has had coronavirus symptoms, tweeted a rainbow picture - in support of healthcare workers - along with hands clapping emojis. 
LENGTHY LOCKDOWN 
The government is considering when it can end a lockdown, though Raab has said it was too early to make a decision because Britain had not yet reached the peak of the outbreak. 
The government says it will have a better idea by next week of knowing if the lockdown has succeeded in bringing down coronavirus infections and hospital admissions. 
“We’ve started already to see plateauing,” said epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College in London who has helped shape the official response. 
It will take several more days to see the pace of deaths drop, and more weeks to draw definitive conclusions that could allow restrictions to be lifted, he added to BBC radio. 
Britain is enduring its third week of stringent restrictions, during which police have assumed new powers to fine people straying too far or too long from home unless on essential work or seeking food and medicines. 
With sunshine bathing the often rain-soaked nation at the start of a four-day Easter holiday from Friday, authorities were on the lookout for those tempted out to see family and friends. 
“The best way we can protect our loved ones is by staying away this Easter,” a government spokeswoman said. [nL5N2BX75I] 
Scotland’s chief medical officer has already resigned after flouting her own advice to stay at home, and another official was under pressure on Friday after newspapers said he travelled to a second home outside London and visited his parents. 
“For clarity - my parents asked me to deliver some essentials - including medicines,” housing minister Robert Jenrick tweeted in defence, adding that he had left London to return to his family home.

The staffers, representing more than a third of the Life Care Center’s 180 employees, are out sick with symptoms resembling the coronavirus and a federal strike team of nurses and doctors is helping care for 53 patients remaining in the center. 
With the Kirkland, Washington, home accounting for over half of all coronavirus deaths in the United States, and all its patients tested, it was unclear why it had not been given kits for staff even as the University of Washington offered to process tests. 
“We would like more kits to test employees,” Life Care Center spokesman Tim Killian told reporters, adding he did not know why they had not been forthcoming. “We’ve been asking the various government agencies that have been supplying us with test kits.” 
Twenty-six of the nursing home’s 120 patients have died since Feb. 19, with 13 of 15 autopsies carried out so far showing that the coronavirus was the cause. Twenty-one of the center’s residents, including those now in hospitals, have tested positive for the virus. 
The outbreak has shown how quickly the coronavirus spreads through elderly residents with weak immune systems and underlying health conditions living in close quarters. 
“We’ve had patients who, within an hour’s time, show no symptoms to going to acute symptoms and being transferred to the hospital,” Killian told a news conference on Sunday. “And we’ve had patients die relatively quickly under those circumstances.” 
Two other nursing homes in the greater Seattle area have reported that at least two residents and one staff member have the virus. 
The University of Washington School of Medicine said on Monday it could test all Life Care staff. The lab’s current testing is running at about 500 specimens a day, but it has capacity for over 1,000 tests a day. 
“We’re happy to perform testing if they can get samples and send them through the University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine,” said Alex Greninger, assistant director of UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories. 
He did not know why Life Care had not received kits, but said a general reason why testing was not higher was a shortage of people to pick up specimens and bring them to his university lab.

The new program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is an example of how doctors are adapting and loosening normal protocols to ease the strain on emergency rooms and intensive care units in New York state, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. 
Since last week, more than 200 people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, have been sent home with a pulse oximeter to track their oxygen levels. A doctor or nurse practitioner follows up with them via video conference. 
“Some of these patients might have been on the borderline of admission,” Dr. Rahul Sharma, who is overseeing the program as the chief of emergency medicine at Presbyterian’s Weill Cornell Medical Center, said in an interview. 
An oximeter is a small electronic device that clips onto a fingertip to indirectly measure the oxygen saturation of a patient’s blood. In severe COVID-19 cases, the virus can block up the lungs, hindering their ability to pass oxygen from the air into the bloodstream. While most who contract the virus recover, it has killed at least 4,900 people in the city, according to a Reuters tally.

Some of the NewYork-Presbyterian patients are also being sent home with a 30lb (14 kg) portable oxygen concentrating machine which sends oxygen-rich air through a nasal cannula, a two-pronged tube inserted into the nostrils. 
The patient is asked to log their oximeter readings to share with a doctor or nurse practitioner at 12-hour and 24-hour consultations. The patient may be re-admitted to the hospital if they take a turn for the worse. 
No patient in the program is known to have died at home as of Wednesday, but about 15 percent were asked to return to hospital to be admitted for inpatient care, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
At least two other hospital systems outside of New York unveiled similar new programs using oximeters in late March. Doctors at other hospitals said Presbyterian’s approach could have benefits for patients with a disease about which they still have much to learn. 
“There’s no guarantees in either direction, there are risks to hospitalization and there are risks with sending people home,” Dr. Laura Burke, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview. 
Doctors have noticed there can be a worrisome lag in symptoms among some COVID-19 patients, with oxygen saturation dropping for some time before a patient is aware of breathing problems. 
For patients that turn up at an emergency department with other COVID-19 symptoms, giving a pulse oximeter to use at home could be one way to “err on the side of safety,” Burke said.

Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough and was rushed to intensive care on Monday. He has received oxygen support but has not been put on a ventilator. 
“Things are getting better for him,” his culture minister Oliver Dowden said on Thursday. “He’s stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff.” 
U.S. President Donald Trump said Johnson appeared to be doing “better” after what he described as a “tough bout”. 
With a prime minister in intensive care, the British government was facing two major issues: how to finance a vast increase in state spending to support the shuttered economy and the timing of lifting lockdown measures. 
As the world’s fifth largest economy faces potentially the worst economic hit since World War Two amid soaring spending, the government said it had expanded its overdraft facility with the Bank of England. 
The Bank of England has agreed temporarily to finance government borrowing in response to COVID-19 if funds cannot immediately be raised from debt markets, reviving a measure last used to any significant degree during the 2008 financial crisis. 
The government and BoE said any borrowing from the Ways and Means facility - effectively the government’s overdraft with the BoE - would be repaid by the end of the year. 
DEATH TOLL RISING 
The United Kingdom is entering what scientists say is the deadliest phase of the outbreak, with deaths expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend. 
The government’s emergency response meeting, known as COBR, will on Thursday discuss how it should deal with a review on lockdown measures. 
Johnson’s designated deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, will chair the meeting, but no final decision will be made at the meeting. London’s mayor and the Welsh government have both said the lockdown would stay in place. 
The number of coronavirus infections and hospital admissions in Britain is beginning to show signs of flattening, said Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service, indicating the shutdown measures were working. 
“We are starting to see a plateauing - the first signs of a plateauing of infections and hospitalisations,” Powis told reporters. 
“We are beginning to see the benefits I believe ,but the really critical thing is that we have to continue following instructions - we have to continue following social distancing, because if we don’t the virus will start to spread again.” 
Total UK hospital deaths from COVID-19 rose by a daily record of 938 to 7,097 as of 1600 GMT on April 7, health officials said on Wednesday.

The company will give one week of pay and will cover the employee share of medical premiums during the furlough period, it said in a statement on Friday. 
Triumph Group also said it will cut about 200 full-time positions due to fall in demand, adding that the reductions will be completed by May 1.

That benefit did not extend to Meagan Christensen, 34, an Iowa warehouse worker who packs online orders of Birkenstock sandals, swimsuits and $60 face cream. The facility recently closed for cleaning after a co-worker contracted COVID-19, but it reopened 36 hours later. 
With Americans stuck at home, warehouse workers scramble to fill surging online orders. Some, such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc employees, often ship groceries and other essentials. Others risk their health for furniture or fashion retailers such as IKEA, Wayfair Inc or Macy’s Inc. 
Government stay-home orders have carve-outs for warehouses or e-commerce operations, allowing a wide array of retailers to piggyback on exemptions intended primarily to ensure the flow of necessities. The loophole means a large segment of retail workers - who often have scant benefits or sick time - must choose between their health and their paycheck. Some retailers, including Wayfair, Kohl’s and Macy’s, have given workers letters from executives to show police if they are stopped while commuting.  
“A lot of people are scared” at Nordstrom, said Christensen, who says she earns less than $40,000 per year and is enrolled in the company’s health insurance plan. “We’re selling designer-line apparel and cosmetics. None of this is make-it-or-break-it for the current situation.” 
Nordstrom said its online operations are keeping its business afloat - and ensuring workers’ livelihoods for the long term. 
“What’s the opposite scenario? Everything gets shut down completely, and we can’t afford to pay your benefits?” said Gigi Ganatra Duff, a Nordstrom corporate affairs vice president. “And we can’t afford to hire you back when it’s over?” 
As in-store sales evaporate, retailers are chasing a captive audience - stuck inside, bored, tempted to shop online. Macy’s ads, echoing others, tout “our lowest prices of the season right now!” 
Those orders are filled by warehouses employing hundreds of people. Stephanie Morris, 57, works for IKEA in New Jersey, shipping sofas and shelves. She says she checks her temperature before each shift. “People don’t understand that, when you order something, there’s got to be someone there to pull that merchandise,” she said. 
Reuters interviewed three dozen warehouse and fulfillment workers and reviewed COVID-19 wage-and-benefit policies at nine retailers - Amazon, Walmart, Target Corp, Nordstrom, Wayfair, O’Reilly Automotive Inc, IKEA, Macy’s and Kohl’s. Five of them - Amazon, Walmart, Nordstrom, Kohl’s and Target - extended temporary $2-per-hour raises to workers, some of whom make less than $15 an hour. Wayfair offered $4 raises. 
The firms said they prioritize safety by cleaning, encouraging social distancing and providing protective gear. Kohl’s, Walmart and IKEA said their workers’ temperatures are checked before shifts, although several IKEA workers said that’s not happening at their warehouses. 
IKEA and Wayfair called their products essential to people who suddenly need home-office furniture or other household items. Consumers depend on “companies like Wayfair to keep them supplied with the items they need for their homes during these challenging times,” Wayfair said, adding that the government has recognized its crucial role. 
A recent report from the Brookings Institution think tank estimated that between 49 million and 62 million U.S. workers 34% to 43% of the total workforce - are employed in industries deemed to be essential under what the organization called a “sweeping” federal definition. Those industries, Brookings found, tend to employ lower-wage workers who often have less health insurance than most Americans. 
Labor relations and public policy experts said the crisis poses dilemmas for employers and workers trying to balance safety with financial survival. For consumers, the ability to shop online makes “this extraordinary period more comfortable,” said Erica Groshen, a Cornell University labor relations professor. 
Online sales amount to an understandable “survival strategy” for a sector that is important to consumers, investors and the economy, said Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But staying open also creates an obligation to give workers more say in benefits and protections. 
“The companies may view these workers as essential,” he said, “but they’re not treating them as essential.” 
Workers themselves are often torn about continuing to work. One of Christensen’s Nordstrom co-workers, Makenzie McMullen, 28, called the warehouse environment a “ticking time bomb,” and yet said she was “very conflicted” about whether to stay home. 
“I do love my job,” she said. “I wouldn’t have been there the last three years if I didn’t.” 
‘EVERY SALE COUNTS RIGHT NOW!’ 
Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group has asked, but not required, workers to report to shuttered stores to package online orders for sweaters, handbags and other items. 
“Every sale counts right now!” wrote a Neiman manager at Pennsylvania’s King of Prussia Mall, in an email to employees. The pandemic has put Neiman in especially dire straits: It is straining to make payments on about $4 billion in debt as it prepares for a possible bankruptcy. Neiman did not comment on whether it has extended additional benefits, but said its precautions include cleaning and temperature checks. 
Some retailers offer more generous pandemic-related benefits than others. Macy’s gave e-commerce employees two weeks of extra paid leave to use anytime. Nordstrom said it would pay infected workers’ medical bills and salaries until they recover. 
Other companies, such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, O’Reilly, Wayfair and IKEA, offered warehouse workers one or two weeks of additional leave if they test positive or get quarantined by a medical professional. IKEA’s policy also applies to workers showing COVID-19 or flu symptoms, those with family members showing symptoms, and workers with underlying health conditions that heighten the threat of the virus, the company said. 
Another worker at IKEA’s New Jersey warehouse, Tiwaan Bradley, 46, has diabetes and lupus, putting him at high risk. When he learned that a co-worker’s wife had tested positive, he stayed home and depleted his sick pay. He said he didn’t learn he might qualify for two weeks of extra sick time until this week, when a manager told him as he was taking up other workplace issues with the company in his role as a union shop steward. 
The extra two weeks of paid leave will help, he said, but likely won’t last him through the pandemic. He said he’s balancing the need for income with protecting his health. 
“In order for me to take care of my family,” Bradley said, “I have to be alive.” 
Nordstrom offered warehouse workers five additional paid days. Kohl’s isn’t offering additional sick leave, workers said; it did not respond to questions on its policy for employees who contract COVID-19. 
Some Kohl’s and Nordstrom in-store workers have the option to return to stores to help with online orders. Other retail employees have been furloughed - allowing them to keep their health benefits and apply for government unemployment insurance, an option some warehouse workers say they wish they had. 
Rae Jones, 29, works at an O’Reilly Auto Parts warehouse in Alabama. She has an autoimmune disease that has already consumed what little sick leave she had, so she continues to work. The company offered no additional virus-related sick leave unless she tests positive for COVID-19. It has not regularly provided sanitizer, she said, so she started giving workers her own homemade concoction of Everclear grain alcohol and aloe vera. 
“I need the paycheck,” Jones said. “But I’m scared.” 
Twice in the last few days, Jones said, dozens of O’Reilly employees walked out in protest over a lack of personal protective equipment. O’Reilly Auto Parts did not comment on the walk-outs or worker complaints, but said it has disinfected warehouses and provided cleaning supplies. 
Cyndi Murray, a Walmart employee in Maryland, said workers must submit a positive coronavirus test and a doctor’s note to a third-party online system to apply for extra paid leave. Decisions take two to seven days, she said, leaving workers in limbo. 
Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the system takes at least two days but did not address concerns about delays. He said employees who test positive, run a high fever or are quarantined can qualify for two paid weeks off. 
FIRING A PROTEST ORGANIZER 
Amazon has taken heat from some workers over safety. Staffers at its Staten Island, New York, facility protested in late March, demanding the facility’s closure for deep cleaning after workers tested positive. Similar protests followed elsewhere. Amazon said it fired the employee who organized the Staten Island protest because he didn’t quarantine himself after contact with an infected worker. 
A Minnesota Amazon warehouse does not provide enough masks, sanitizer or gloves, said worker Sahro Sharif. Managers instruct workers to wash their hands and clean work stations, Sharif said, but keeps them too busy to do so. 
Stephanie Haynes, an Amazon employee in Joliet, Illinois, said the company did not shut down her warehouse after a worker tested positive. Instead, Amazon checked surveillance cameras to determine who had worked within six feet of the infected staffer and asked those employees to self-quarantine. Others were asked back to work, even if they were convinced they had been exposed, she said. 
“It’s very scary,” said Haynes, 42. “Amazon decides if you’ve had close contact with an infected person.” 
Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said the company distributes masks, sanitizer and wipes, but did not address complaints of shortages. Amazon is taking “extreme measures” to ensure safety, she said. She did not answer questions about company protocols for shutting warehouses after confirmed infections. 
In late March, Wayfair workers at a New Jersey warehouse were told an employee had tested positive. The building closed for cleaning and reopened 24 hours later. A second employee tested positive on Sunday. 
Wayfair said 13 workers have tested positive, and in each case it cleaned facilities and identified those in close contact with infected staffers. The company said it paid all employees during closures and paid workers in quarantine. 
SELLING KNICK-KNACKS, GUCCI SUNGLASSES 
Akeel Sudlow, 28, works at the warehouse as an IT support engineer. When he requested to work from home, citing ill health and school closures, his manager said he could go unpaid, according to communication seen by Reuters. 
“Unless I’m sick and dying, there’s no support for me,” said Sudlow, who has stayed home without pay for a month. 
The company said it has allowed workers to work from home if they can effectively do their jobs there. 
Anthony Costa, who works for Macy’s in Connecticut, decided to use up his leave time to avoid the warehouse after seeing crowded conditions and limited sanitation supplies.

“To have a thousand-dollar pair of shoes is something that in my opinion is not essential,” said Costa, who loads merchandise and drives it a short distance between two warehouses. “You could wait until this is over to order some Gucci sunglasses.” 
Workers at IKEA have questioned why they risk their health to ship decorative plastic trees, knick-knacks and couches. Ahnisohn Harmon, 42, who works at a New Jersey warehouse, described a tense environment, with heightened awareness of every cough and workers constantly diagnosing one another. The company encourages social distancing, he said, but employees are often lifting items weighing 50 pounds or more - requiring a partner. 
“We’re going to be in each other’s face,” he said, “breathing each other’s air.”

Because it's so new, researchers are still learning about the virus's behavior as it rapidly spreads across the globe. 
In addition to its ease of transmission, the following three aspects of the disease have caught the attention of medical experts.
Patients can spread the virus for days before they show symptoms
The incubation period for COVID-19 can run from just two days to nearly two weeks.
""The problem with this virus is that it is able to be transmitted before symptoms manifest,"" said Dr. David Hamer, an infectious disease specialist at Boston Medical Center and a professor of global health at Boston University's School of Medicine and School of Public Health. ""Most viral pathogens aren't transmitted until symptoms are present."" 
Asymptomatic patients also make screening more difficult. Airport screenings for fever, for example, won't catch patients who aren't showing symptoms but are still contagious.
Medical experts also believe that there are a large number of people out there who have either had the bug and didn't know it, or have it now and are showing few or no symptoms.
Because of this, medical experts have been pushing social distancing as the most effective way to control the spread of the disease.
Patients lose their sense of smell
One odd aspect of the illness is that some patients lose their sense of smell while they're sick. While it's still unclear what percentage of patients experience this, the phenomenon may help identify asymptomatic or mildly ill patients.
Other respiratory infections, like the common cold, can also cause a loss of smell and taste, but it's a bit different for patients with COVID-19.
""Whenever you get a cold and have a stuffy nose, you can lose your sense of smell and have trouble tasting because of that,"" said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston. ""What seems to be unique with COVID-19 is that the sense of smell is lost without much in the way of nasal congestion. We are now considering this a symptom of COVID-19 infection.""
Patients who seem to be recovering can suddenly crash
Doctors say another unusual aspect of COVID-19 is how patients who appear to be doing well can deteriorate within a few hours to the point where they're in respiratory distress.
""We've had a fair number of people progress to severe disease that had a period of improvement followed by a sharp decline,"" said Kuritzkes. He added this could be due to an immune response kicking in that negatively impacts the lungs.
Because of this, experts recommend that people who have been diagnosed with or suspect they have COVID-19 carefully monitor their symptoms.
""Worrisome symptoms would be persistent fever, severe cough and increasing difficulty breathing, initially with such activities as walking or climbing stairs but if severe, even at rest,"" said Hamer. He added patients should contact their physician if they notice such changes.
Dr. Gabriela Andujar Vazquez, an infectious disease physician at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said patients should also watch for chest pain, and advised anyone experiencing chest pain or breathing difficulty to head to the emergency room.
""People need to really monitor themselves for the first week. After the first week, you'll either get better or worse,"" said Adnujar Vazquez.

The nationwide lockdown, which has been in effect since March 27, came as authorities moved fast amid concerns about the high percentage of the population with compromised immune systems, making them most vulnerable to COVID-19.
South Africa has among the highest prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis in the world, according to UN AIDS and TB Facts. 
So far, only 13 people have died from COVID-19 in the country of almost 60 million people — due in part to the stringent lockdown. 
Streets are deserted as movement outside of residences is restricted to grocery shopping and doctor visits.
Outdoor exercise and dog-walking have been forbidden. The sale of alcohol, cigarettes, clothing, homeware, and all other goods deemed non-essential is illegal. South Africa has even banned fast-food deliveries.

Many South Africans are now confined to their own homes and many have been stripped of their incomes.
South Africa's Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, for instance, caused massive outrage after an Instagram photo of her having lunch at the home of a friend, a former official and colleague, circulated on social media, according to News 24.
Less than a day after the photo first surfaced, South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa put the minister on two months' leave, one of which will be unpaid.
A nationwide lockdown was imposed before anyone had died of the novel coronavirus.
YouTube / News24
While the Ndabeni-Abrahams's former colleague said ""executing critical and essential services required for the effective functioning of our country during the nationwide lockdown,"" President Ramaphosa said he was ""unmoved"" by excuses for the outing. Her friend had earlier claimed she was picking up a donation of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, according to the News 24 report.
Ramaphosa said the law must be allowed to take its course in determining whether she breached lockdown regulations.
He also demanded a public apology, which Ndabeni-Abrahams delivered shortly thereafter, asking South Africans to ""find it in your hearts to forgive me.""
However she's not the first public figure to have flouted new coronavirus-related rules.
According to the BBC, Scotland's chief medical officer, Caroline Calderwood, resigned after she visited her country home during lockdown — twice.
—Police Scotland (@policescotland) April 5, 2020
She was found to have flouted her own advice on coronavirus by traveling to her second home.
New Zealand's health minister, David Clark, was also demoted after being photographed going biking and taking his family to the beach.
While South Africa is rolling out mobile coronavirus test stations, testing has not been widespread so far.
There are concerns that, with the arrival of colder autumn temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere, it may be too early to lift restrictions.

The stringent measures have also brought unexpected benefits.  
Emergency rooms are unusually quiet while travel restrictions and a ban on alcohol sales have seen fewer car accidents and a sharp decline in crime.
In the first week of lockdown, only 94 murders were recorded in the country — from 326 in the same week in 2019. The number of rapes was down 86%.

However, certain patients are more prone to severe lung damage from the novel coronavirus. Doctors break down how the coronavirus can severely damage the lungs and…",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-coronavirus-damages-the-lungs-2020-3,https://i.insider.com/5e81ee892d41c115b35ee0a5?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-03-30T13:09:37Z,"Last week, George Washington Hospital released a video that used Virtual Reality (VR) technology to show the lung damage suffered by a 59-year-old patient with severe COVID-19 symptoms. The video shows ""rapid and progressive damage to the lungs,"" said Dr. Keith Mortman, Chief of Thoracic Surgery at George Washington Hospital on the hospital's podcast.
While it's hard to predict who will get severe symptoms of COVID-19, ""some people, especially those who already had underlying lung issues, may end up with some kind of long-term damage,"" Mortman told Business Insider.
To understand how COVID-19 can severely damage the lungs, it helps to understand the way SARS CoV-2 enters the body, said Dr. Osita Onugha, MD, Chief of Thoracic Surgery at John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica. ""The virus has a way of attaching to a specific receptor on lung cells called the ACE2 receptor,"" he said.  ""It's like the ACE2 receptors are the lock, and coronavirus SARS CoV-2 has a key that allows it into the lung tissue.""
As the virus takes hold in the lung cells, the body tries to fight it off. ""We're starting to think of the disease as a one-two-three punch,"" Mortman said. ""The first inciting event is the virus, and the second step is the way the body deals with the virus in the lungs, which is to create an inflammatory process to contain the virus, flooding the lungs with inflammatory cells.""
That combination of infection and inflammation is what causes the breathlessness that patients experience as the disease worsens. ""The shortness of breath can cause oxygen levels to drop, which can lead to the need for a ventilator and it can progress from there,"" Mortman said.
The third punch, which can happen in the most severe cases, is the release of cytokines in the bloodstream, which can damage vital organs. ""Most of these patients are really dying of systemic organ failure — the first effect is the strain on the heart, then the kidneys can start to fail, then the liver can fail,"" Mortman said. 
The reason that ventilators are proving so critical in COVID-19 treatment is that they assist with lung function, preventing the drop in oxygen levels that can damage vital organs. That said, being intubated and on a ventilator takes a significant toll on long-term health.
""If you're younger and healthier, you're likely to survive COVID-19, but you still may end up on a ventilator for some period of time, and when that happens, your muscles begin to atrophy,"" said Onugha. Just a few days on a ventilator can mean up to 6 months of recovery before you're back to where you were, he added.
Lung conditions like chronic bronchitis and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) raise the risk of severe symptoms because the lungs are already weakened, said Mortman.
But inflammation also raises the risk of those with less severe conditions, such as asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 
And while there's little data as of yet, allergies to dust, pollen, and other airborne particles can increase sensitivity, also providing possible pathways to inflammation, said Onugha. ""Anyone with asthma or allergies should try to keep their condition under control with medication.""
Smoking is another risk factor. The American Lung Association (ALA) on Friday released a warning to people who smoke and vape that they have an increased risk for developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms and should consider quitting. Other conditions, like asthma and allergies, may also exacerbate symptoms in patients with COVID-19. According to the ALA, both smoking and vaping have been linked to lung inflammation and lowered immune function.
""There is data to show that e-cigarettes and vaping cause very similar changes in lung cells to regular cigarettes,"" said Mortman.
Smoking marijuana should be included in the risk factors as well, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Onugha echoed this and explained like this: ""If you think about the COVID-19 pandemic as a marathon, you're injuring the muscles you need in that race when you vape or smoke anything. If you already have inflammation present when the coronavirus goes into your lungs, you've started with a tank half empty.""

COVID-19 can be most easily distinguished from from colds, allergies, and the flu based on a trifecta of symptoms: fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. That last symptom is not associated with colds or flu, though it is with allergies. 
If you're sneezing and have a runny nose, it's unlikely that you have COVID-19. The flu is also more likely to come with aches and pains than COVID-19.

Diarrhea is a rare symptom of the coronavirus, but gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea could be early clues of infection, according to a growing body of preliminary research. It also is a symptom mostly unique to COVID-19, with the exception of some children with flu.
Still, the overlaps between COVID-19 and other common conditions are in part why widespread testing is necessary. Some countries, like China and South Korea, have tested hundreds of thousands of people. But according to the COVID Tracking Project — a test-tracking resource from two journalists at the Atlantic and the founder of a medical data startup — only about 8,000 tests have been run in the US. They note, however, that those figures may be incomplete due to different state policies on reporting negative tests.

Games over the first three weekends of May will still count towards overall win-loss records. Actual tournament matches won’t, but the top four squads in each region will earn bonus wins towards playoff qualification.
The league is also suspending hero pools for the tournament weekend, so players will have access to all 32 characters. Matches will stick to the standard first-to-three-maps format, save for the finals, which will be first to four.
With the move to a homestand format this year, in which teams were to play all matches at live events in their home cities, the Overwatch League ditched the format of previous years, which had three sets of mid-season playoffs with prize money and stage titles on the line. But after just a few weeks of homestands, the COVID-19 outbreak prompted the league to switch to online-only play for the rest of the season and drop plans for a $1.05 million mid-season tournament.
The May tournament might revive interest among lapsed viewers, as it brings back week-to-week stakes. Viewership this season hasn’t quite been hitting the heights of 2018 and 2019 after the Overwatch League moved from Twitch to YouTube. Concurrent viewers for a match on Sunday were around 22,000 at one point. Viewership was usually at least in the high five figures in 2018 and 2019.
""Our plan tentatively is to try to do more of this as we look at June and July,” Overwatch League vice president Jon Spector said during a league broadcast on Sunday. “I think we could land on a pretty similar structure, then we start to head into the end-of-season playoffs and finals. We do want to do more of this, but we will also be monitoring feedback and making sure it's as awesome and fun as we think it is before we set a plan further out."""

National champion Morkov, 34, left the UAE Tour on Wednesday and arrived in Berlin on Thursday to begin training for Sunday’s madison event in the Berlin velodrome. 
But the Tour was canceled on Thursday after two staff members of one of the participating teams were suspected of contracting the coronavirus. 
The entire UAE peloton, including four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome, plus staff and officials, were in lockdown in their Abu Dhabi hotel - and Morkov meanwhile was also confined to his hotel room in Berlin where he will undergo tests. 
Denmark team spokesman Morten Anderson said Morkov was training alone in his room on rollers. 
“He is in good spirits and doing fine, but he’s tired of this situation that he has to be in the hotel,” Anderson told reporters. 
“It’s voluntary and we’ve told him not to leave. He would like to go to the track to train but now we are waiting for the UCI and German medical authorities to tell us his status. 
“Hopefully we’ll get the answer in a couple of hours.” 
Anderson confirmed that Morkov was in the velodrome celebrating with the Danish team pursuit champions on Thursday. 
The situation regarding the cancellation of the UAE Tour remained confused on Friday. The previous night, Froome and other riders took to Twitter to say they were confined to their hotel rooms, organizers said two Italian staff members of a team had been tested positive for novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. 
But cycling’s governing body the UCI said on Friday that the cases were only suspected ones. 
“The UCI confirms that the two final stages of the UAE Tour (23-29 February), which were to be raced Friday and Saturday, were canceled late yesterday,” the UCI said in a statement. 
“...While waiting for the results of tests and their communication, (authorities)... took the decision to interrupt this event in the interests of the health of riders and their staff, and to avoid the virus spreading.” 
Riders who were in the UAE Tour also face an anxious wait to find out the results of their tests. 
“Depending on the results obtained, these individuals will either be able to leave the country or, if contamination is confirmed, will be placed in quarantine,” the UCI said. 
It was “doing everything within its power to ensure the health of riders and people concerned.” 
The rapid rise in coronavirus raised fears of a pandemic on Friday, with six countries reporting their first cases, and the World Health Organization warning it could spread worldwide.

But, if you wear contact lenses, touching your eyes isn't just a habit, it's necessary. Many of us contact lens and glasses wearers have some burning questions about keeping ourselves safe during the pandemic. But there's also quite a lot of myths and misinformation out there on this topic. 
So, what should you do? A new peer-reviewed report by five prominent ocular scientists answers some of the most pressing concerns and questions you might have about eye care. Those experts include Lyndon Jones and Karen Walsh from the University of Waterloo in Canada, Mark Willcox from the School of Optometry and Vision Science, UNSW, Sydney, and Jason Nichols from the University of Alabama, U.S., and Philip Morgan from the University of Manchester, UK.
The paper, published in Contact Lens &amp; Anterior Eye, aims to reassure contact lens wearers with facts and advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Should you stop wearing contact lenses completely? If you become unwell, can you carry on wearing contacts? Do your glasses offer you any protection? Here's what the experts recommend.
Wearing contacts does not make you more vulnerable
Good news for contact lens wearers, you can carry on wearing your lenses as usual. According to the paper, there is ""no evidence that contact lens wearers are more likely to contract COVID-19 than spectacle wearers.""
The report does caveat that the lack of evidence could be due to the newness of COVID-19. ""It could be argued that COVID-19 is so new that such data would not yet exist. However, the lack of evidence from previous outbreaks of coronavirus disease, including SARS, suggests that the risk of developing COVID-19 from contact lens wear is low,"" it reads.
SEE ALSO: Worried about coronavirus? Stop touching your face.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) echoes this statement on its website, stating that lens wearers should ""continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits.""
If you are sick, stop using contacts
If you do develop COVID-19 symptoms, the paper recommends you stop wearing contact lenses. 
""If a patient were to develop COVID-19 any contact lenses that were being worn at that time should be immediately disposed of as should any remaining disinfecting solutions and contact lens cases that the patient possess, the patient must revert to spectacle lens wear and when fully recovered should recommence wear with a new pair of lenses,"" reads the study. 
Spectacles are not PPE 
If you were thinking your glasses might be doubling up as personal protective equipment (PPE), think again. According to the report, regular eyeglasses or spectacles do not protect you against COVID-19.
Maintain good hygiene habits
The paper also recommends thorough hand-washing and drying, as well as taking good care of your contact lenses, and maintaining good lens case hygiene. 
UK optician Specsavers has a list of useful hygiene tips for inserting lenses during the pandemic. ""We already advise that you replace your case every month and wed suggest you continue to do this. Remember, each morning you should empty your case of the old solution; rinse your case with fresh solution and then air-dry it upside down on a clean tissue,"" writes Specsavers' clinical services director, Giles Edmonds, in the post.

The post also notes that using hand sanitiser before inserting your lenses could result in some discomfort. ""If you pass alcohol from your hands to your eyes via your lenses, you could end up with discomfort as it could affect your eyes,"" Edmonds writes. ""My advice would be to stick with the soap and water option making sure your hands are thoroughly clean.""
In line with guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC, keep unwashed hands away from your face and avoid touching your nose, mouth, eyes with unclean hands."

The densely populated region of some 1.9 billion people has been less badly affected than other parts of the world, but new coronavirus cases in Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka are all accelerating, with the total across South Asia now exceeding 750. Seven people have died. 
Authorities worry that these countries could be especially at risk, should the virus begin to spread locally, due to poor health facilities and infrastructure in much of the region. The virus has already infected more than 245,000 people worldwide, and led to over 10,000 deaths. 
A police curfew is set to be imposed nationwide in Sri Lanka from 6 p.m. local time on Friday until 6 a.m. on Monday, as authorities on the island moved to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected 65 people there. 
The religious body that oversees mosques in the nation directed all of them to shut indefinitely. About 10% of the country’s 22 million people are Muslims. 
Meanwhile, mosques elsewhere in the region screened people for high temperatures using thermometers and urged their faithful to practice greater social distancing during Friday prayers. 
MODI’S APPEAL 
In an address to his nation late on Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to citizens to stay home and avoid panic-buying, as India outlined plans to halt all international flights in an effort to stem the number of cases in India, which passed 200 on Friday. 
Following Modi’s appeal, a senior district official in the town of Ayodhya in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh, said he expected the state government to call off the Ram Navami Mela, a major Hindu religious gathering in the temple town. 
“We’re expecting an official order in a couple of days and it will be in line with what our prime minister said yesterday in his address,” said the senior official. 
The annual Ram Navami fair in Ayodhya brings millions of Hindus to the holy city. This year authorities were expecting a surge in numbers, as the foundation-laying ceremony of the grand Ram Temple, was also expected to take place. 
Sharad Sharma, the spokesman for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist organisation, said it had asked its cadre not to hold any procession on Ram Navami. 
“We’re also requesting people ... pray and celebrate Ram Navami in their homes, in community temples and  not to gather in large numbers at any place. We will follow the appeal of our prime minister,” he said.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was set to hold a phone hook-up with Reserve Bank of Australia officials and financial regulators on Saturday, his spokeswoman said, without elaborating on what would be discussed. 
It will be the second crisis meeting involving the central bank, the country’s prudential regulator and markets watchdog and follows the government’s A$17.6 billion ($10.9 billion) stimulus plan this week to prevent the coronavirus outbreak triggering a recession. 
Australia has 197 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including three deaths. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday called for an end from Monday to all non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people, including sporting and cultural events, and urged people to reconsider overseas trips. 
While the request did not apply to businesses and public transport, some companies have asked staff to work from home. 
In the biggest such move, Australia’s top telecommunications company, Telstra Corp Ltd (TLS.AX), on Friday ordered around 20,000 staff, 70% of its workforce, to work from home starting on Monday until at least the end of March, a spokesman said. 
Ahead of the ban on big gatherings, the Australian Formula One Grand Prix, scheduled for this weekend, was canceled. A concert by UK pop start Robbie Williams that was to take place at the race track on Saturday was also called off, organizers World Tour said. 
“Gutted I’m not able to perform tomorrow in Melbourne,” Williams said on Friday on Twitter. 
Morrison had planned to attend a rugby game on Saturday but decided late on Friday not to go after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was diagnosed with COVID-19. They had attended a cabinet meeting together on Tuesday. 
The prime minister said he had received medical advice that only people who had been in contact with Dutton over the previous 24 hours needed to self-isolate. 
Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said on Saturday that it was “extremely unlikely” anyone who was at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting would have contracted the infection from Dutton. 
However, U.S. President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who met Dutton in Washington on March 6, decided to work from home on Friday.

In the conference, which ended on Wednesday without a deal after 16 hours of talks, Germany, the Netherlands and other northern European countries were ready to support EU measures worth 500 billion euros, officials who participated in the meeting said. 
The EU support would back up national measures, but the overall fiscal effort may not be enough to meet total financing needs, the officials said. 
In the meeting France, Italy and Spain said the European effort to tackle the crisis should be well above 1 trillion euros this year, officials said, in line with the ECB estimate of financing needs of 1 to 1.5 trillion. 
While the participants narrowed the gap in views during their lengthy talks, a deal could not be reached mostly due to resistance from the Netherlands and Italy, officials said. 
Italy wanted a more ambitious agreement with clearer references to future common debt issuance, while the Netherlands pushed for conditions to any EU credit line to countries in need.

Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough, and was rushed to intensive care on Monday where he spent three nights receiving treatment. 
“The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery,” a spokesman from his office said in an emailed statement. 
“He is in extremely good spirits.” 
Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control of the world’s fifth-largest economy to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain’s outbreak approaches its most deadly peak. 
Raab tweeted that the improvement in Johnson’s condition was “the news we all wanted to hear”. U.S. President Donald Trump described it as “great news”. 
Johnson's ongoing recovery prompted a small rise in the value of sterling against the dollar GBP=. 
However, the government statement did not give any details on when Johnson may be able to resume leadership, and Raab - speaking before the latest announcement - had stressed the importance of allowing the prime minister to focus on recovery. 
No further updates on Johnson’s health were expected on Thursday. 
Raab is deputising for Johnson during the most stringent shutdown in Britain’s peacetime history. 
Earlier he told a news conference it was too early to end the lockdown because Britain had not reached the peak of the outbreak yet. 
The UK death toll in hospitals from coronavirus now stands at 7,978, a rise of 881 on the day but a smaller increase than the 938 seen in Wednesday’s data. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
With Johnson absent and the death toll still mounting, the British government is wrestling with two major issues - how to finance a vast increase in state spending to support the shuttered economy, and when to start easing lockdown measures. 
With the economy facing potentially the worst hit since World War Two, the government said it had expanded its overdraft facility with the Bank of England. 
The central bank has agreed temporarily to finance government borrowing in response to COVID-19 if funds cannot immediately be raised from debt markets, reviving a measure last widely used during the 2008 financial crisis. 
The BoE said it was a short-term measure and both it and government said any borrowing from the Ways and Means facility - effectively the government’s overdraft with the Bank - would be repaid by the end of the year. 
The government has made pledges costing tens of billions of pounds to support businesses and workers hit by the virus. On Thursday, the government said an additional 1.2 million claims for welfare payments had been filed since March 16. 
Raab said the peak of the virus outbreak had yet to be reached and that the government would not be able to say more about the duration of the lockdown until late next week, once experts have had chance to analyse data on how well it is working. It was introduced last month. 
“The measures will have to stay in place until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we’ve moved beyond the peak,” he said. 
While Johnson’s condition was improving, the likely length of his recovery remained unknown, with some political commentators saying there was a power vacuum in his absence. 
Raab said on Thursday he had the power to make “necessary decisions” in the prime minister’s absence and that government will continue to follow the strategy set out by Johnson. He said cabinet could take decisions collectively. 
The United Kingdom is entering what scientists say is the deadliest phase of the outbreak, with deaths expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend. 
But in a sign the shutdown measures were working, health officials have said the number of coronavirus infections and hospital admissions had begun to show signs of flattening. 
Police said they would be taking tougher action to do just that before the four-day Easter holiday weekend because many people were continuing to ignore the ban on social gatherings.

Announcing an extra $150 million of funding from The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to help speed the development of treatments, vaccines and public health measures to tackle the new coronavirus outbreak, Melinda Gates said the WHO was “exactly the organization that can deal with this pandemic”. 
“De-funding the WHO makes absolutely no sense during a pandemic. We need a global coordinated response,” Gates, who co-chairs the foundation with the billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, said in a telephone interview. 
“When you’re in a crisis like this, it’s all hands on deck.” 
President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday a halt in U.S. funding to the WHO, saying it had “failed in its basic duty” in allowing the pandemic to take hold. 
The Gates Foundation is the second largest donor to the WHO behind the United States. Melinda Gates said earlier that cutting WHO funding in a health crisis was “as dangerous as it sounds”. 
The WHO’s Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday he regretted Trump’s decision. He said the organization was still assessing the impact and would “try to fill any gaps with partners”. 
The philanthropic Gates Foundation’s new $150 million commitment brings its COVID-19 funding for the international response to date to $250 million, but Gates said any gap left in the WHO’s funding would be very hard for others to fill. 
Alongside support for new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, the Gates money is primarily aimed at helping poorer countries and vulnerable populations handle the oncoming and spreading pandemic and the poverty it will cause. 
“We really as a global community need to address what is now just beginning in African and South Asian countries. We see a huge need, and that’s why we have more than doubled our commitment,” she said. 
Praising what she described as “heroic work” by local leaders and healthcare workers in poorer countries seeking to protect vulnerable communities and slow the spread of COVID-19, Melinda Gates said the world’s response to the pandemic “will not be effective unless it is also equitable”. 
“Whenever a health crisis hits like this, it’s the people on the margins that it hits the very most,” she said. “They’re the ones we need to help to ensure things like cash transfer payments are made and they have access to primary healthcare.” 
There are currently no effective vaccines, drugs or other immune system treatments approved to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
The $150 million of extra funding adds to an initial $100 million from the Gates Foundation designed to kick-start scientific and public health projects. 
Gates said the Foundation is backing eight projects seeking potential solutions for COVID-19 vaccine development and has co-funded enhanced virus detection capacity in Africa as well as contributing to the response in China.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, and other health officials pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units - particularly in hard-hit New York state - as signs that social distancing measures are paying off. 
“Now is no time to back off,” Fauci told CNN on Friday. “The virus will decide” when the country can begin to reopen from state-at-home orders imposed in recent weeks across 42 states, he added. 
Those measures have taken a staggering toll on American commerce, with some economists forecasting job losses of up to 20 million by month’s end, raising questions about how long business closures and travel restrictions can be sustained. 
The Trump administration renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model this week lowered its U.S. mortality forecasts to 60,000 deaths by Aug. 4, from at least 100,000, assuming that social-distancing measures remain in place. 
The New York Times cited separate forecasts from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services projecting the death toll could reach 200,000 if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days. 
The United States by far accounts for most of the world’s confirmed cases of COVID-19, the highly contagious lung ailment caused by the novel coronavirus, with at least 500,000 known infections and more than 18,600 deaths. Only Italy has recorded more fatalities. 
Prisons and jails, along with nursing homes and other institutions with large populations confined in close quarters, have proven especially vulnerable to outbreaks, with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Illinois, New York and Louisiana. 
On Friday, officials said 68 residents and two staff members at a San Francisco homeless shelter had tested positive, marking one of the largest known clusters of coronavirus infections yet in such a facility anywhere in the country. 
The outbreak there seemed at odds with promising data presented by California Governor Gavin Newsom showing that social distancing has worked so far to flatten the arc of infections in his state. 
New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic with some 7,800 deaths to date, likewise has seen glimmers of hope this week. 
After three days of record daily deaths, New York state’s COVID-19 toll from April 9 stood at 777, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. But New York’s ICU admissions declined “for the first time since we started this journey,” he said. 
In Michigan, more than 200 people died from COVID-19 in the last day. “We are not out of the woods yet,” Governor Gretchen Whitmer said. 
GOOD FRIDAY AT A DISTANCE 
At his daily White House briefing, President Donald Trump said he was receiving fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help. 
Meanwhile, with more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast to congregants watching from home. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshipers. 
“We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children’s Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can’t do any of that this year,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy lamented to reporters. 
“I’m really missing the community aspect of being with everyone,” said Rebecca Swindle, a 26-year-old mother of two in central Florida whose church began holding virtual services five weeks ago to help curb coronavirus transmission. 
Swindle said she planned to watch a livestream of Good Friday evening prayers - normally “a huge gathering of worshiping God” - and to promote her church’s online Easter service on her Facebook profile. 
One megachurch in South Carolina turned to the model of once-popular drive-in movies, presenting services filmed live and shown on a big screen with the audio broadcast over the radio to worshipers in their cars. 
A handful of holdout U.S. churches planned to go ahead with in-person Easter Sunday services, saying their rights to worship outweighed public health warnings. 
“Satan and a virus will not stop us,” said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday. 
FOOD DRIVE DRAWS THOUSANDS 
Friday also ended another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues and schools shuttered across the nation. 
In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive. 
“This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,” said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. “It’s continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.” 
At the other end of the food supply chain, a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, owned by meatpacking company JBS USA said it would spend more than $1 million for coronavirus testing kits to screen its workers after 36 employees became infected. 
Two employees have died of COVID-19, according to the union representing workers at the plant. The company said it was shutting down over the holiday weekend to “further enhance previously announced deep cleaning efforts at the facility.” 
 New York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported COVID-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population. 
African Americans comprise 70% of Louisiana’s coronavirus deaths but only a third of its population, said Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.

Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London late on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature, for more than 10 days. 
His condition rapidly deteriorated over the next 24 hours, and he was moved to an intensive care unit - where the most serious cases are treated. Although he had received oxygen, his office said he was still conscious. 
Downing Street said the move to intensive care was “a precaution should he require ventilation to aid his recovery”. 
Britain has no formal succession plan should a prime minister become incapacitated. 
“The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary,” Downing Street said. 
Just hours earlier, Johnson’s office said he was in good spirits and Raab had told a news conference that the prime minister was still running the government. 
The pound edged lower against the dollar and the euro in Asia on Tuesday, trading at $1.2234 following a 0.3% decline on Monday. 
BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE 
“The government’s business will continue,” a somber Raab, 46, told reporters, saying Johnson was in the safe hands of a brilliant medical team. 
“The focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the prime minister’s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.” 
Britain has some important decisions to make in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak. The official death toll in the United Kingdom currently stands at 5,373, and last week the health minister said the deadliest peak for deaths was projected to be Easter Sunday, April 12. 
The country is in a state of virtual lockdown, a situation due to be reviewed early next week, and some ministers have suggested it might need to be extended because some people were flouting the strict rules. 
There have also been calls for ministers to detail what the exit plans were from the shutdown, which has hammered the world’s fifth-biggest economy after the government ordered restaurants, bars, and nearly all shops to close and told people to stay at home to curb the spread of the virus. 
“EXTREMELY SICK” 
Johnson tested positive for the virus on March 26, the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive for COVID-19. 
After 10 days of isolation in an apartment at Downing Street, he was still fighting the virus on Sunday evening with a high temperature and persistent cough, prompting his admission to hospital. He was last seen in a video message posted on Twitter on Friday when he looked weary. 
“There is no doubt this turn of events means Boris Johnson is extremely sick,” said Derek Hill, a professor of medical imaging at University College London (UCL). 
Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth had been kept informed by Downing Street and U.S. President Donald Trump said all Americans were praying for his recovery. 
“He’s been really something very special - strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up,” Trump told a news briefing, adding he had asked two pharmaceutical firms developing potential COVID-19 therapies to get in touch with the British government to offer their services. 
“We’ve contacted all of Boris’ doctors and we’ll see what is going to take place,” he said. “But they are ready to go.” 
Johnson, who is not a smoker, said recently that he wanted to lose weight. He plays tennis and while mayor of London used to cycle around the capital. 
The face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, he won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31. 
He faced criticism for initially approving a much more modest response to the new coronavirus outbreak than other European leaders, saying on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients. 
He changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom and in the last few weeks the virus has penetrated the British government. 
Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and chief medical adviser Chris Whitty self-isolated. Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancée, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.

By Sharon Bernstein 
SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 30 (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state had nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of ICU patients tripled during that time. 
By Monday, 1,421 California patients had been hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, up from 746 four days ago, Newsom said. The number of patients requiring intensive care beds rose to 597 from 200, he said. Altogether, 5,763 people have tested positive for the disease in the state, he said. 
The rapid increase in the need for hospital and ICU care led Newsom to set up a website to connect retired doctors and nurses, as well as medical and nursing students, to hospitals and clinics that need them. The state will help retirees activate their licenses and students obtain licensing. 
“If you’re a nursing school student, a medical school student, we need you,” Newsom said. “If you’ve just retired in the last couple of years, we need you.” 
The state is hoping its initiative, dubbed California Health Corps, will bring on board enough staff to handle an additional 50,000 hospital beds, Newsom said. 
In a livestreamed video with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, Newsom thanked the couple for a previously unannounced $25 million donation in support of the health corps. 
A Facebook spokeswoman said the donation was coming from the company and would help cover costs like temporary housing near health care sites, child care costs and licensing fees. 
An executive order signed on Monday also temporarily allows physician assistants and nurse practitioners to perform some duties normally performed by physicians and registered nurses, and waives other state rules during the crisis. 
Medical professionals who sign up under the program will be paid with state and federal funds and provided malpractice insurance. (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; additional reporting by Katie Paul Editing by Sandra Maler, Dan Grebler and Sonya Hepinstall)"

<li>Contact tracing has become a major tactic around the world in tracking and containing the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.</li>
<li>While effective in other countries, the United States has yet to deploy contact tracing at scale. </li>
<li>Locatio…",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-contact-tracing-works-to-stop-coronavirus-spread-2020-4,https://i.insider.com/5ea1ee0cd553f8055e2e999b?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-04-23T21:02:00Z,"Following is a transcription of the video: 
Narrator: As COVID-19 continues to spread around the globe, one tactic in particular, called contact tracing, has been highly effective in countries like Taiwan, Singapore, and Iceland. But there is a trade-off. Contact tracing asks us all to share data with the government and corporations, information that some people prefer to keep private. So the question becomes: How much privacy would you be willing to trade to save lives?
The specifics of contact tracing vary by country, but the basics remain the same. Step one: identify and isolate confirmed cases of COVID-19. Step two: trace their movement and contact with others backwards, finding people who may be at risk without knowing it. Step three: quarantine and track the movements of confirmed cases going forward.
Syra Madad: It's a very lengthy process that requires many different steps, but at the end what you're trying to achieve is to break that chain of transmission, so that way you don't have new outbreaks, if you will, or new cases of the disease itself.
Narrator: Rather than spending time treating new cases, contact tracing allows officials to stop the spread of the virus in the first place. That's how countries that have implemented contact tracing have been able to flatten the curve. This requires a lot of manpower. It also requires a monumental amount of data, which is where the issue of privacy comes into play.
To make contact tracing truly effective, it is important to have verifiable records of people's whereabouts and contact with others. Some countries have developed apps that trace your cellphone's GPS signal, thus keeping a log of every place you've been. To many, that might sound like the start of a dystopian horror movie: the government tracking your every move and knowing everyone you speak with. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic seems straight out of a horror film itself, and the results of contact tracing speak for themselves.
Take Singapore for example. The number of confirmed cases in the country is around 4,500 as of April 16, despite being relatively near China, the country where experts believe the virus originated. Singapore was aggressive in adopting contact tracing. The country utilized the national health service, police detectives, and a contact-tracing app to track the spread of the virus. Their contact-tracing program was so effective that about 40% of people in the first wave of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country discovered that they had been exposed to the virus when they received a phone call from Singapore's Ministry of Health. The call informed them of when, where, and how they came into contact with the virus and told them to be tested and isolated.
Meanwhile, in the United States, government authorities have not yet aggressively pursued contact tracing as a tactic to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, despite the fact that there are now more confirmed cases in the US than any other country in the world. We saw this play out in New York City, where the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was diagnosed on March 1. Just a week prior, the woman who tested positive had returned to New York from Doha, Qatar, landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Public officials promised to track down every person who had been aboard her flight to identify other potential cases. But according to The New York Times, that never happened.

Something is loading.
A lack of available tests and the uniquely dense population of New York City also contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in the city and the state, where more than 240,000 cases have now been reported. And while New York did engage in contact tracing to an extent, it was nowhere near as vigorous as in countries where the practice has been highly effective.
Madad: China, for example, implemented a huge workforce, and they were able to do tens of thousands of contact tracing every single day. We do not have that infrastructure here in the United States yet. Another thing to note is that they were just doing in a very small area of China. We would need to do it throughout the United States because we are having hot spots throughout the United States.
Narrator: In New York City, where the population is over 8.3 million, 50 disease detectives were deployed to trace the spread of the virus in the early days of the outbreak. That's only one disease detective for every 166,000 people. Wuhan, China, where the crisis is thought to have originated, has a slightly higher population. There, more than 9,000 disease detectives were deployed to trace known cases. This disparity is not unique to New York, however. In the United States, only about 3,600 disease detectives have been trained by the Epidemic Intelligence Service program since 1951. That's for a population of over 329 million people.
While manual contact tracing is important, data helps. Singapore has released an app that not only tracks users' location, but also uses Bluetooth to record proximity to others who are using the app. And though manual contact tracing may not be as robust in the United States, data collection certainly is. Citizens' movements are on full display via Silicon Valley companies big and small. Lesser-known entities like Cuebiq and Unacast have already been providing tracking data to the public. And while Unacast collects its data via an opt-in app, Cuebiq says only that it relies on ""Cuebiq's first party data"" to create its interactive map. So, with the technology and data for contact tracing readily available, the question remains, why was the US so slow to adopt contact tracing on a wider scale?
The answer may be our own rights to privacy and how dearly we hold them. Americans' attitudes about their private data being shared are well documented. Wiretapping phones of American citizens was a hot-button political issue in the not-so-distant past. And, more recently, large corporations mining us for data has come to the forefront of the national consciousness. Those attitudes may shift as the COVID-19 crisis continues.
Madad: So, in order for us to get to a post-coronavirus-disease era where we're able to lift some of these social-distancing restrictions and, you know, for all intents and purposes, resume whatever our normal lives would look like, we need to make sure we're able to implement rigorous contact tracing to be able to isolate those individuals and quarantine individuals that may have the disease itself.
Narrator: While a recent poll showed that a majority of Americans agree that measures like closing schools and businesses are necessary to combat the coronavirus, they also share a desire to return the day-to-day operations of the country to as close to normal as possible as soon and as safely as possible. At the same time, health experts predict a second wave of the virus to hit sometime in 2020 or 2021. So offering up our location information might be the best way to get through this.
Madad: Safeguarding privacy is something that is going to be a huge roadblock. But, at the same time, I think that we're living in a very technology-savvy society where we should be able to, with some degree, you know, work around that. I think we can have this even as a voluntary basis. Being able to consent, in a way, in letting them know this is obviously what's great not just for them, but for the greater community if we wanna resume our normal life, whatever that's, again, gonna look like, you know, this is something that needs to be done.
Narrator: The tech world has already started to publicly collect this data. Facebook's Data for Good program has created data maps that show distributions of people reporting COVID symptoms, density of at-risk populations, areas that are socially connected to current hot spots, and more. Apple and Google have announced plans for a joint venture to create an opt-in contact-tracing app that would be compatible with both Apple and Android phones. But with this push for more government access to location-tracking data also comes another push for more user protection. As of now, there are no comprehensive federal laws around data privacy in the United States. It's happened only on a state level.
In 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act was enacted, giving California users the legal right to know what data is collected, the right to delete personal information held by businesses, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information. Other states are following California's lead. Nevada passed similar legislation, and New York, Texas, and Washington have also proposed legislation similar to California's privacy act. In other states, legal rights to data privacy are not nearly as clear or strong. So in the case of the US, what we do know is that large amounts of data, including location tracking, are already being collected. The questions become what we as a nation will do with that data to confront the COVID-19 crisis, whether the public is willing to release it, and how we will protect that data going forward."

Not every game offered through PS Plus is spectacular (there are plenty of releases that wouldn't get much traction otherwise), but Sony has made a point of frequently slipping real gems into the mix. This January saw the company give away Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection, for instance, while the March freebies include the remastered classic Shadow of the Colossus.

She writes regularly for Vanity Fair Italy and the Italian newspaper La Stampa. Follow her on Twitter @simonasiri. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)When on March 13 my husband, Dan, came down with Covid-19 symptoms high fever, dry cough, chills my first reaction was rage, and then panic. Rage because I had spent the previous two weeks telling him to wash his hands and stay home, close the office, don't take the subway. Panic because I am Italian. I have been in New York only for seven years. My family and friends are in Milan, the center of the outbreak in Italy. I knew what was coming. It was going to be horrible. I tried to warn him. Why did he not listen to me?
Like Cassandra, the mythological Greek figure cursed with the ability to correctly predict the future without ever being believed, I felt I was reliving that same tragedy. Italy confirmed its first two coronavirus cases on January 30, halting flights to and from China and declaring a state of emergency the following day. On February 23, celebrations for the Venice carnival were ended early, and soccer matches were canceled.
As this was unfolding, I relayed the events to my husband. He was concerned but still didn't seem to grasp the magnitude of the situation. In the meantime, I was listening to stories about Italian life in lockdown put in place nationwide on March 9 and reading in Italian newspapers about the toll on health care workers hit by the virus while they were caring for infected patients. ""It is like being at war"" is the description that almost every doctor gave to the press. ""You have no idea,"" a friend told me over Skype. ""The silence in Milano is unreal, shattered only by the never-ending sound of the ambulances. It's like living in a horror movie.""
My husband was far from being the only skeptical one. On March 8, I had a heated text exchange with a highly educated and informed friend. She was planning to go to a play that night because she was ""counting on the sick people to stay home."" I tried to convince her that the only thing to do was to stay in. She didn't. As the number of deaths in Italy was rising toward 200 a day on March 12, I told her, my husband, my American friends, anyone who would listen about the morgues in Italy so crowded that in Bergamo, a small town near Milan, army tanks had to come to take the coffins away.
I felt isolated and alone. My American friends and I were not only speaking two different languages but living on different planets. I disconnected from everyone around me. No one seemed to get it. At least when I was speaking with my friends back home, they knew. We could share the same pain. For the first time I even considered moving back. At least I would have felt understood.
As I write this, the US has 86,043 coronavirus cases with 1,304 deaths. New York, now the US epicenter of the outbreak, has at least 30,811 confirmed cases, nearly 23,000 in New York City alone. The statewide death toll is nearing 400. I read about the passing of a Mount Sinai nurse, the shortage of protective gear for healthcare workers. I see the picture of the three nurses using black garbage bags as gowns. 
All I feel is a strange déjà vu. I saw the same pictures three weeks ago in Italian newspapers. I read similar stories of healthcare workers forced to work shifts of 16 hours. Singalongs from the balcony, people clapping to salute and thank the health care workers -- even these forms of stress release and spirit uplifting, I already saw them.
Listening to President Trump saying that ""nobody expected"" this pandemic is especially infuriating for me. Ask my Italian friends, Mr. President. I can provide names and numbers. Ask people who couldn't even say goodbye to their loved ones because in Italy there are no more funerals, no more burials, no holding hands at the very last breath. 
After two weeks of uninterrupted fever which never, thank God, developed into respiratory problems, my husband is out of the woods. It has been the most difficult time in our marriage. We often clash due to different cultural backgrounds, but this time was different. I put on his shoulders all the flaws in the way the American government was handling the coronavirus emergency. ""Why don't you get it?"" I yelled at him one night. ""Why don't you learn from my country?"" I screamed at him, but I wanted to scream at America. 
After we both calmed down, I explained to my husband really for the first time why this was so especially painful for me. As I did so, I learned something about myself: I have grown to love my adopted country as much as my native one. Watching one fail to learn from the mistakes of the other has been heartbreaking. Experiencing this crisis as it begins to overtake my adopted country, I feel something common to so many immigrants: a heart continuously split in two."

Many in the general public are only vaguely familiar with competitive gaming at best. A smooth race could do much to inform people about virtual motorsports, even if only a fraction of viewers keep watching once conventional NASCAR returns."

The retailer had maintained that it was an ""essential business"" as it improved the quality of life for people working from home. It reportedly went so far as to instruct stores on how to respond if police attempted to enforce closures.

Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge
A group of scholars and nonprofit organizations have asked web platforms to keep track of the content theyre removing during the coronavirus pandemic so they can make it available to researchers studying how online information affects public health. The signatories including Access Now, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and EU DisinfoLab sent an open letter to social media and content sharing services, urging them to preserve data even as they remove misinformation.
The importance of accurate information during this pandemic is clear. But knowledge about the novel coronavirus is rapidly evolving, reads the letter. That creates an unprecedented opportunity to study how online information can affect health outcomes and to evaluate the consequences of specific moderation practices like using heavy automation. Such studies rely on information that your companies control including information you are automatically blocking and removing from your services. It is essential that platforms preserve this data.
It is essential that platforms preserve this data.
The letter urges companies to preserve content that is removed from the service, including accounts, posts, and videos. It also encourages them to keep records of the removal process itself, like whether a takedown was automated or received human oversight, whether users tried to appeal the takedown, and whether content was reported but left online. Some of that information could be included in public transparency reports, and other pieces could be released specifically to researchers. It will be crucial to develop safeguards to address the privacy issues raised by new or longer data retention and by the sharing of information with third parties, says the letter. But the need for immediate preservation is urgent.
The novel coronavirus has spurred companies like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove what they deem harmful misinformation, including stories that promote fake cures or suggest that health measures like social distancing dont work. Facebook has removed some calls for protests that violate state shelter-in-place rules, although that appears to be a very small proportion of the events. Twitter has deleted posts from Brazils and Venezuelas presidents on unproven treatments for COVID-19.
And researchers are looking at the links between peoples media diets and their behavior during the pandemic. A recent study examined the difference between viewers of Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, who took starkly different stances on the coronavirus the former downplayed its importance, while the latter sounded an early alarm. Combining survey data from Fox News audiences with information about infection and death rates, researchers found that areas with a higher Hannity viewership had roughly 30 percent more cases in mid-March and 21 percent more COVID-19 deaths in late March. 
Social media has also created important channels for information and misinformation, so research into what users are seeing and what sites are removing could provide a valuable window into how people engaged with the pandemic. It could also help track any campaigns to deliberately sow confusion or panic and help platforms understand how to promote good information during a time of uncertainty."

Google and Apple both released tools that show people's mobility in specific areas and how much it's decreased amid government-mandated shutdowns. In both cases, the companies gleaned this data from people using Apple Maps and Google Maps, as well as location data from iPhone and Android users, respectively.
Facebook published a map showing how many people are reporting COVID-19 symptoms in each county in the US, gathering data by surveying millions of Facebook users. This week, the company also released a mobility dashboard that aggregates information on people's movements from a conglomerate of private companies, as well as public resources like satellite imagery and census data.

The thread Butterfield posted is a long one, chronicling how the situation unfolded from early March and, interestingly, how the number of Slack users sky-rocketed.
SEE ALSO: The most important thing to know about social distancing
On Tuesday. March 10, Slack hit 10 million simultaneously connected users. After that, it quickly passed the 10.5 million and 11 million milestones.
Butterfield also shared three charts, from March 12, 16, and 23, chronicling the number of ""newly created teams on Slack which we believe to be for workplaces."" 
You can see the massive spike in the second week of March, as more and more companies began encouraging staff to work from home.
And now we saw evidence of a huge increase in demand. This was March 12, so the ultimate impact wasnt yet clear. But we could see it in, e.g., this chart of newly created work teams.

He also went on to compare Slack's growth in recent weeks with its growth in the second half of 2019, saying that the company added 5,000 customers in Q3 and Q4 combined, but had added 9,000 in Q1 this year alone.
Butterfield ended the thread with an offer for workers ""on the frontlines fighting COVID-19"" to use the service for free.

“Today is the day with the lowest number of new cases in the past 20 days,” he tweeted.
The number of administered tests was also down to about 30,000 Saturday, which the minister attributed to a decreased need because of lower contact opportunities.
According to the data, 3,558 people were released from hospitals in the past 24 hours, making the number of recovered patients 29,140. Koca said the downward trend continued in patients needing intensive care.
Turkey ranks seventh in the world for the number of confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins University, but experts believe the actual toll of the pandemic is higher than the tally.

More than 372,000 such cases have been documented worldwide.
""Eventually, if all goes well, your immune system will completely destroy all of the virus in your system,"" Tom Duszynski, director of epidemiology education at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, wrote in The Conversation. ""A person who was infected with and survived a virus with no long-term health effects or disabilities has 'recovered.'""
Still, many uncertainties remain: It's not yet clear how many people have recovered, how the illness will affect them in the long run, or how long they'll be immune.
Here's everything we know about the people who have recovered from COVID-19.
Recovery by the numbers

Although more than 372,000 people who had the coronavirus had recovered worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University database, the true number is probably far higher than that.
While Johns Hopkins tracks case counts and death tolls reported by each county and region across the globe, data on recoveries is less precise. Many counties, states, territories, and regions don't report how many of their residents have recovered.
""Recovered cases outside China are country-level estimates based on local media reports and may be substantially lower than the true number,"" Douglas Donovan, a spokesman for the university, told CNN.
Plus, due to limited testing availability in some countries, including the US, the most severe cases are prioritized for official diagnoses. People who have mild symptoms, or none at all, are less likely to get tested — if they even seek testing in the first place. That means that many mild infections are not included in the count of total cases or recoveries.
That can skew experts' understanding of the disease and how they predict its trajectory.
""Knowing the real number of infected people in the population would be very useful to have better models of when disease will peak and decline, and also when we can begin to return people to work,"" Dr. Bala Hota, a professor of infectious diseases and Associate Chief Medical Officer at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center, told CNN.
What recovery is like

Hota told CNN that many patients still have a mild cough and feel tired even once they're considered recovered and are no longer contagious. It can take a long time to fully get back to normal.
""It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, said in a March press briefing. ""People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness.""
The process is different for patients who were put on a ventilator. 
""What we're seeing in patients who end up on ventilators is that they often stay on them for several weeks,"" Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a professor at the University of Washington Harborview Medical Center, told US News &amp; World Report. ""And then, coming off the ventilator, they're often going to be in the ICU for several days, and then back [in a regular hospital unit] for a few days to a week or so to regain their strength.""
Lasting effects

Dr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, a pathology professor at the University of Chicago School of Medicine, told ABC News that most people with mild cases of COVID-19 should recover ""with no lasting effect."" The future is murkier for patients who develop severe illness, though.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority reported in March that within a group of 12 recovered patients, ""two to three"" showed decreased lung capacity in follow-up visits with doctors. Those few patients gasped for air when they walked, according to the South China Morning Post. Scans of nine patients' lungs revealed signs of organ damage.
But because the coronavirus was first identified in December, there hasn't been much time to research recovered patients and publish the findings.
""This is a little bit of an understudied group,"" Hota said.
Experts do have a sense of the effects that severe pneumonia can have on the body, though. If a patient develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), that can scar their lung tissue.
""It's the same general thing that you have with any type of phenomena that's severe enough to land you in the ICU,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told ABC News.
Adalja and Xiao both said that some severely ill patients may never recover full lung function.
Antibodies and immunity

People who have been infected develop antibodies that can probably fight off the coronavirus if they encounter it again. This makes them immune, but it's unclear how long the protection lasts.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview on The Daily Show that he was ""willing to bet anything that people who recover are really protected against re-infection.""
He also said earlier this week that because the virus doesn't seem to be mutating much, people who recover will likely be immune should the US see a second wave of spread in the fall.
""If we get infected in February and March and recover, next September, October, that person who's infected — I believe — is going to be protected,"" Fauci said.
That's why identifying people who've recovered is imperative in the fight against the outbreak — those people could return to work safely.
A handful of companies are developing blood tests that can detect COVID-19 antibodies to identify people with immunity.
""Ultimately, this might help us figure out who can get the country back to normal,"" Florian Krammer, a professor in vaccinology at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, told Reuters. ""People who are immune could be the first people to go back to normal life and start everything up again.""
However, some reports have stoked fears that immunity doesn't last as long we'd hope. The Korean CDC said Monday that a group of 51 people who had recovered from the coronavirus later tested positive, according to the government-funded Yonhap News Agency. China has reported similar incidents. But the KCDC's director-general, Jeong Eun-kyeong, said it's more likely that the virus reactivated in the 51 patients, rather than that they got reinfected.
When you can leave self-quarantine

If you're sick and wondering how to know when you've recovered, the CDC's guidelines depend on whether or not you were tested.
If you weren't tested and probably won't be, you should stay isolated until you meet three criteria: You've have had no fever for at least 72 hours (without fever-reducing medication), your other symptoms (such as shortness of breath or coughing) have improved, and at least seven days have passed since the onset of symptoms.
If you have gotten or will receive a diagnostic test, you need to test negative twice, 24 hours apart, before leaving isolation. Those tests must be done after you no longer have a fever (without fever-reducing medicine) and after other symptoms have improved.
Once you have met these criteria, you can leave your home for essential outings, in accordance with your city, county, and state rules. You should still minimize contact with others, though, as well as disinfect all surfaces, clothes, and objects you've touched.
Crystal Cox/Business Insider
Scientists still aren't sure when a person with the virus stops being contagious to others, but a team of German researchers found that coronavirus patients ""shed"" high amounts of virus early on in their infection. (The research is not peer-reviewed yet, however.) In mild cases, the amount of the virus the gets shed decreased significantly after day five.
Patients with mild cases were not infectious eight days after they first started experiencing symptoms. The serious cases were not infectious after day 10 or 11.

The Earths growing population and the ease with which we can travel long distances have contributed to the fast spread of the novel coronavirus to more than 200 countries.
For the moment, the main question is, how do we stop the spread of the virus? For states, the choice is between health and the economy. They must either shut down their economies and impose nationwide quarantines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, or continue business as usual and risk infecting millions of people with the virus. Most governments have chosen the former.
But even though our lives will never return to its former state, humanity will eventually overcome the coronavirus. The aftermath, however, the tragic deaths, the economic recession, and the shock of everything else were experiencing today will face our governments with a new question: How do we stop the next pandemic? The options will then shift to choosing between health and privacy.
We already have the tools that can help to fight the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. Mobile phones, internet of things (IoT) devices, wearables, security cameras powered by artificial intelligence algorithms, and other advanced technologies of the past decade can enable us to precisely track every persons location, vital signs, and health status. They can help track collocations, find out who else might have been infected by a patient, warn citizens about infections in their proximity, prioritize testing and care, manage local quarantines, and more.
Read: [Coronavirus didnt kill our privacy it just exposed the corpse]
With the help of technology, governments will be able to control the spread of infectious diseases without the need to shut down their entire economies and sending everyone home. Already, several countries have passed laws that are loosening privacy rules to allow government agencies and tech companies to cooperate in the fight against COVID-19.
But the power of technology goes beyond that, and it can serve evil purposes as well. States such as China are already using state-of-the-art technology to openly establish a surveillance regime with the help of large tech companies. Western governments have so far been reluctant to follow suit (even though tech giants have not), and the voices of privacy advocates have been loud enough to hold digital Big Brother in check to some degree.
As the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, privacy advocates are raising the alarm and warning against solutions that breach citizens privacy. But with health taking a front-row seat, the digital surveillance regime is becoming justified and the privacy argument sounds less convincing.
To help address this problem, a group of computer scientists at Boston University has proposed a solution that can help track contagious diseases without the need for dystopian privacy-invading tools.
The default privacy-invading option
The default and easiest way to solve the problem of tracking infectious diseases is to use the traditional server-client structure that underlies most internet services and applications. An application installed on the users mobile app regularly records the persons location and transmits the information to a data center that stores it.
The location data can be consolidated with other information such as body temperature, blood pressure, and other vital signs obtained from wearable medical devices. When a person contracts COVID-19 or another infectious disease, the server application queries its database for all users who might have come in contact with or been in the vicinity of the infected person. The server can then notify those people, instruct them to self-quarantine, and prioritize them for testing. This kind of contact tracing is vital to stopping the spread of viruses.
There are many other benefits to such a system, lets call it the health-tracker app. For instance, its data can be fed to machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models of the spread of the virus based on movement patterns. It can also warn users to avoid areas frequented by infected persons. Some companies have already developed AI-powered solutions that have predicted the spread of COVID-19 with remarkable accuracy.
Many large tech companies are already doing location trackingsometimes without you knowing about itfor commercial purposes. But you can opt-out, avoid installing their tracking applications, use privacy-friendly alternatives, and use virtual private networks (VPN) or other tools that can hide your location. Not giving your location might deprive you of some of the convenient features of those apps or require you to pay for their services. Its a conscious choice you make between privacy and convenience.
But when installing the health-tracker app becomes law, you will be left to choose between preserving your privacy at the cost of breaking the law or abiding by the law at the cost of your privacy. Just as traffic police can stop you and ask to see your drivers license, the health police might stop you and verify that your health-tracker app is active and is registering your location. Breaking the law can earn you a fine or maybe get you some jail time for compromising public health.
The privacy-friendly alternative
Image source: NIAID
In a paper titled, Anonymous Collocation Discovery: Harnessing Privacy to Tame the Coronavirus, a group of computer scientists at Boston University proposes that we dont need to invade peoples privacy to protect them against infectious diseases. The paper provides the blueprint for an extremely simple scheme for providing fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual.
The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that it is possible to promptly and reliably notify individuals of past or present collocation with an infected person or surfacewith only minimal compromise of individual privacy and without maintaining any database of infected individuals or their locations, the researchers write.
The privacy-friendly health tracker is composed of a mobile application and a server. The mobile app generates a unique anonymous random token at regular intervals, say every minute. Instead of sending tokens to a server, however, the application stores it on-device and at the same time broadcasts it through the devices Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) component. Devices that are within range and have the privacy-friendly health tracker installed to receive and store the tokens. These tokens comprise the devices collocation database.
The tokens contain no device, location, or personally identifiable information, so storing them on other devices has very minimal privacy risks. The tokens are also very small in size, so the application should be able to register dozens of millions without causing storage constraints for the device.
When a person tests positive for COVID-19 or some other infectious disease, a medical authority confirms the infection, and the app sends all the tokens it has generated to the application server. Again, with no device, location, or personal information being embedded in the tokens, the server will not be holding any sensitive information. Furthermore, theres no information to indicate whether two tokens come from the same user. This unlinkability promise ensures that the service cannot form a location trace of a participants movement patterns, thereby obviating the concern that a location trace may be connected to a specific person, the researchers write.
The application periodically polls the server for the list of infected tokens and compares them against its collocation database. In case of a match, the user will be warned of a possible collocation with an infected person. Due to the privacy-oriented nature of the application, they will not know of the time or the location or the person with whom they have come in contact. The user can then take the necessary measures, such as consulting with medical experts for the next steps.
The authors of the paper acknowledge that this is not a perfect solution. They write, We emphasize that being in close proximity with an infected person or surface is not a definitive indicator of transmission of disease: two people may be in close proximity without transmitting the virus, or the virus may transfer through aerosols between two parties whose collocation is separated by time. As such, the proposed ideas are intended to complement (not substitute!) effective prevention techniques such as social/physical distancing.
When combined with sufficient testing capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope that this may significantly reduce the infection rate, the researchers recommend.
What I especially like about the solution offered by the Boston University researchers is its simple and minimalist structure. I could imagine this application implemented on a wearable device, say a digital wristband with a few gigabytes of storage and a BLE component sold at a very low price. The device would not even need an internet connection, and the transmission of the data of infected patients could be performed by a separate application installed at hospitals and testing stations. This could even improve its security, preventing bad actors from flooding servers with bad data.
Last week, Apple and Google declared work on a COVID-19 tracker mobile application that is strikingly similar to the one proposed by the BU researchers. But I would still prefer to see this implemented on its own barebones device that has no extra components and minimizes the attack and abuse surface.
The effectiveness of these kinds of solutions depends on their mass adoption rate. While it remains to be seen how far the privacy-friendly health tracker will succeed, the work of Boston Universitys researchers provides a glimmer of hope that we dont need to live in a world where health will come at the cost of privacy.

A February report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention based on 72,000 cases found that 81% of COVID-19 patients had moderate symptoms, 14% had a more severe reaction that required hospitalization, and 5% percent were considered critical enough to warrant ICU intervention. Other studies in Europe and the US have presented a similar profile.
Based on the data we have so far, the consensus among medical experts is that people who are older, immunocompromised, or have significant underlying conditions are more likely to experience severe symptoms and poorer outcomes. But COVID-19 has also killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of young people with no apparent underlying health conditions.
Far more data is needed to capably determine what puts someone at higher risk for life-threatening complications from COVID-19.
""This is one of the key areas being studied."" Abraar Karan, a professor of internal medicine at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider. ""Aside from age and comorbidities, we don't know.""
Heart and lung health may be a factor

Christian Hartmann/Reuters
A growing body of research suggests that heart and lung function play a role in symptom severity. The study from China, for example, indicated COVID-19's fatality rate jumped from about 1% to 6% in those with lung disease or heart problems.
Another report, from Italy's National Institute of Health, found that of 355 COVID-19 patients who died, 30% had narrowed arteries and 7% had irregular heartbeats.
Immunologist Philip Murphy at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has theorized that variations in the gene carrying ACE2, an enzyme that attaches to the surface of lung and heart cells, may impact how easily the virus can enter those organs.
""If a person has a healthy set of lungs, then getting a serious infection might be survivable,"" Rishi Desai, chief medical officer for the medical-education site Osmosis, told Business Insider. ""A similar infection in someone who has very limited lung or heart function can overwhelm and kill them.""
Men are experiencing worse outcomes
Gender is also emerging as a predictor of coronavirus outcomes: In most countries, COVID-19 diagnoses are split fairly evenly between the genders, but fatality rates are much higher for men. In China, for example, 4.7% of men who contracted COVID-19 died, compared to just 2.8% for women. In hard-hit Italy, the disease was fatal for nearly 15% of men, but only 8.2% of women.
In Italy, the COVID-19 mortality rate among men is nearly twice as it is among women.
Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images
Unfortunately, in the US, the CDC's main COVID-19 tools, COVID-Net and its weekly activity tracker, don't provide gender information. States have also been lax in providing such data. But in every country where COVID-19 fatalities are tracked by sex, women have been more likely to survive.
That's not entirely surprising: The X chromosome houses the genes responsible for programming our immune system. So women, who have two X chromosomes, typically have a stronger immune response than men, who only have one.
In March, researchers from China's Huazhong University of Science and Technology found that women with severe cases of COVID-9 had more coronavirus antibodies than equally afflicted men, likely making them more able to fight off the virus.
The role of lifestyle in surviving COVID-19
It's also possible that men are more likely to succumb to COVID-19 because of their habits. The World Health Organization estimates, for example, that 34% of men over the age of 15 smoke cigarettes worldwide, compared to only 6% of women.
""Unhealthy lifestyle habits can absolutely increase your chances of experiencing more severe symptoms,"" Ramzi Yacoub, chief pharmacy officer at SingleCare, told Business Insider. ""Since COVID-19 directly impacts your lungs, people who smoke are at a higher risk, due to how harmful smoking is to your lungs and heart.""
Smokers are at a higher risk for serious complications from COVID-19.
Thomson Reuters
Alcohol consumption can contribute to liver disease, a risk factor for developing severe coronavirus outcomes, according to the CDC. The typical American male drinks four gallons of alcohol a year, compared to two for women.
America's obesity epidemic may also impact outcomes, University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Osterholm said.
""We know that about 45% of the US population over the age of 50 is obese,"" Osterholm said in a March radio interview with WCCO. ""I worry that we are going to see a major increase in case fatality rates here in this country, compared to what's been seen in some other countries in the world, just because of that somewhat unique risk factor to us in the US.""
COVID-19 is disproportionately killing black Americans 
Although they account for 18% of the US population, African Americans represent a third of all US COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to new CDC data. White people represent 59% of the US population, but only 45% of hospitalizations.
In an analysis of 14 states, the CDC found that African Americans are also dying from the virus at alarmingly disproportionate rates. In hard-hit New York City, African Americans have been twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than whites, while in Chicago, 72% of recorded virus-related deaths were among African Americans, though they comprise just 32% of the population.
Data suggest the risk of a severe coronavirus outcome is increased by high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma— all conditions more prevalent among black Americans. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, nearly a third of African American adults have high blood pressure, compared to 24% of white adults.
In New York City, COVID-19 has killed twice as many blacks as whites.

But African Americans are also less likely to have health insurance than whites, making them more reticent to take on the cost of health services, according to a National Institutes of Health study. The NIH also found that African Americans have less access to quality healthcare, creating a higher likelihood of severe outcomes, regardless of the illness.
""The severity of this disease in the African American community is a crisis within a crisis,"" Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said, according to the AP.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged in a White House briefing on Tuesday that people of color may have more comorbidities than white counterparts. But he added there is a duty to investigate the role of stigma and discrimination.
""When you're in the middle of a crisis, like we are now with the coronavirus, it really does, ultimately, shine a very bright light on some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society,"" Fauci said. ""So when all this is over — and as we said, it will end, we will get over coronavirus — but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community.""

After finishing what for many w…,https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-us-hospital-staff-share-hardest-moments-on-shift-2020-4,https://i.insider.com/5e9718d773d0c8567069b9f5?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-04-15T14:43:05Z,"BALTIMORE, Md. (Reuters) - The shifts are long and the scenes are heartbreaking inside a Maryland hospital where nurses and doctors have been treating coronavirus patients for weeks, unable to let family inside to visit loved ones on their death beds.
One of the hardest moments of a recent workday for registered nurse Julia Trainor was intubating a patient and then calling the patient's husband so he could talk to his wife. He was not allowed in the hospital.
""I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear as he told her that he loved her so much, and then I had to wipe away her tears,"" says Trainor, who works in a surgical intensive care unit. ""I'm used to seeing very sick patients and I'm used to patients dying, but nothing quite like this.""
The highly infectious COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus has infected more than 580,000 people across the United States and killed nearly 24,000.
In Maryland, where residents have been ordered to stay at home since March 30 to stem the spread of the disease, around 9,000 have tested positive for the virus and more than 260 have died.
After finishing what for many was a more than 12-hour shift, some nurses and doctors at one hospital shared with Reuters the hardest moments of their days. The hospital asked that it not be named.
The medical workers agreed that one of the toughest parts of the job — more than the exhausting schedule or adjusting to working in a new unit — was witnessing the toll on patients and families.
Because of the hospital's no-visitor policy, which was implemented to prevent further spread of the virus, the medical staff must care for the patients' physical needs and offer as much emotional support as they can muster in the absence of the patients' families.
""The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing COVID patients die helpless and without their family members beside them,"" says Ernest Capadngan, a nurse in the hospital's biocontainment unit.
Communicating with the families has weighed heavily on the hospital staff. Staff cannot bend the no-visit rules, even when a family calls in desperation.
""I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn't come to see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him,"" says Tracey Wilson, a nurse practitioner.
""One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a COVID patient say goodbye over an iPad,"" says Tiffany Fare, a nurse in the biocontainment unit. ""You can't see your loved one and then they're gone.""
There are very few opportunities to rest during a shift, although colleagues look out for one another and try to cover for each other when someone needs a break.
Cheryll Mack, a registered nurse in the emergency room, says she tries to get outside for 15 minutes during the day to breathe.
""It has given me relief, just fresh air,"" Mack says.
Each shift concludes with a similar decontamination drill. Nurses and doctors must remove their personal protective equipment and shower immediately before coming in contact with their family at home.
""I take a very long, very hot shower. And then I usually sit on the couch and... read a book or watch some mindless reality show in order to destress,"" says Martine Bell, a nurse practitioner.
Laura Bontempo, an emergency medicine physician, says she removes her work clothing and gear in a decontamination tent she has set up outside her home, and then wraps herself in a towel and runs inside to shower.
Then she puts the scrubs in the washing machine by themselves to not contaminate any other items.
Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner, says she drives home each night without turning on the radio and uses the quiet time to reflect on her shift and her patients. When she gets home, she tries hard not to dwell on the day.
""I go home, I shower immediately and try to have dinner with family, and try to not talk about it,"" she said. ""Nighttime is definitely the hardest because you're constantly thinking about what the next day will bring.""

The US president made the remark during a White House press briefing on Monday, adding that the issue would be discussed over the next four weeks.
On Friday, Google and Apple announced a partnership that will see them create a Bluetooth-driven contact-tracing system for detecting the spread of coronavirus, which will gradually be rolled out in the coming months.
The basic idea is to alert people if they have come into contact with someone infected with the virus.
Discussing this tech, and how it might be used, Trump said: ""We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That's something we're gonna be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it.""
It's not clear what specific constitutional problems Trump thinks the tech poses, but the firms say it will require explicit user consent and does not collect personally identifiable information.
People who test positive for COVID-19 will not be identified to other users, Google, or Apple.
The partnership would enable iOS and Android devices to communicate using apps from public-health authorities. with the firms initially aiming to release a set of APIs in May that would enable interoperability between Android and iOS.
Then, over the coming months, the firms hope to build a broader, more robust platform for tracking the spread through Bluetooth technology that users can opt in to.

Spot, a four-legged robot from robotics company Boston Dynamics, is being put to use at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Massachusetts during the coronavirus pandemic. In a paper released Thursday, Boston Dynamics explained how the quadruped bot was quickly transformed into a medical worker in a matter of weeks. 
With an iPad and two-way radio on the robot, healthcare workers video conference with patients and remotely control Spot as the robot dog walks through rooms with infected or potentially infected patients. 
SEE ALSO: Self-driving cars are now helping people affected by COVID-19
After the hospital reached out to Boston Dynamics six weeks ago, Spot has been reprogrammed to help with initial patient assessments. These are real patients with coronavirus symptoms that usually require up to five healthcare professionals to assess them. 
Boston Dynamics is opening up its software and hardware to help more medical workers avoid exposure with telemedicine. It wants robotics teams to develop new ways to remotely measure body temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation. 
Only a month ago, Spot was helping factory workers. Now the robotic dog is helping essential medical workers interact with people with COVID-19."

Take, for example, the SARS outbreak in 2003 (also a coronavirus), the H1N1 flu in 2009, or even the ongoing HIV epidemic. They don't compare for a number of reasons.
This coronavirus is novel, which means infectious disease experts necessarily have much more to learn about the recently-emerged microbe, particularly how to develop treatments to combat or quell the resulting disease, COVID-19. Still, dubious comparisons have been made to earlier virus outbreaks that either were successfully contained or already have treatments, suggesting that the new coronavirus might be similarly managed. Meanwhile, flag-waving protesters at crowded, conservative demonstrations claim the new pathogen isn't too serious as they rail against the large-scale shutdowns intended to curb the spread of this still-developing outbreak.
""The danger of these comparisons is its apples and oranges,"" said Dr. Vince Silenzio, an M.D. and professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health. ""It's so different.""
Of note, there are no approved antiviral medications to treat the new coronavirus. In contrast, there are proven drugs to combat influenza and effective medications to keep people infected with HIV healthy. And unlike coronavirus, SARS which did not spread widely in U.S. communities and killed a total of 774 people globally in 2003 was contained. This coronavirus, meanwhile, swept through the nation while the federal government led by a president who in January said ""We have it totally under control"" failed to test and isolate infected Americans. (For reference, so far there have been over 1,000 reported American COVID-19 deaths each dayfor 19 straight days in April.)
Now, the virus is everywhere, and it may take years to put a lid on this pathogen. ""This one has spread to a lot of people and spread quickly,"" said Silenzio. The microbe is hospitalizing severely sick young and old people alike, though people over 65 are the most vulnerable. 
Unlike SARS or Ebola, which sicken people relatively quickly, many folks infected with this coronavirus are healthy carriers, meaning they can unwittingly spread the microbe (even by talking) while they feel fine. Some asymptomatic people are coronavirus ""super-spreaders.""
And critically, there's no vaccine for this new virus, and there probably won't be one for at best a year to 18 months.
What is known about this coronavirus is that it's already killed over 42,000 Americans (as of April 21), and it's on track to, optimistically, kill tens of thousands more. It's pernicious.
""It is very dangerous at the peak of this pandemic to treat this virus as pedestrian, especially by making false equivalence arguments to previous experiences with pandemic viruses,"" said Mark Cameron, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University who helped contain the outbreak of SARS.
Compared to well-researched pathogens like SARS, HIV or the 2009 H1N1 'swine' influenza, scientists are ""deeply concerned"" about the ""mounting unknowns"" of COVID-19, emphasized Cameron. That's because COVID-19 is already having a devastating impact on our most vulnerable citizens and overtaxed health care systems, he said. 
It's unknown why the virus makes some people perilously sick, but perhaps one in four people have no symptoms at all. It's uncertain how many people in the U.S, have been infected, and it's unknown if people can really be reinfected or how long people remain immune.
""We are standing on the shore and were looking out at the water ahead of us,"" said Silenzio. ""We can see the horizon, but we don't know whats over the horizon.""
Although coronavirus is not nearly contained and some weighty questions about it loom large, society does have a potent public health weapon to limit its spread a weapon CDC director Robert Redfield has called ""powerful.
"" It's social distancing. And it's almost certainly having a big influence on driving down infections and deaths. You can't infect people if you're not exposed to them.
Some might call current, unprecedented social distancing measures too severe, or as U.S. Attorney General William Barr labeled them, ""draconian."" But they're one of the few public health weapons in our arsenal. 
""Social distancing is one of the only tools we have,"" Brian Labus, a professor in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Public Health told Mashable earlier this month. ""It's not like we have treatments. It's not like we have a vaccine.""  
""We don't know whats over the horizon.""
""Its too early to debate whether the dramatic measures we are taking are too severe in ultimately containing COVID-19 as it peaks,"" compared with how we've dealt with previous, better-understood outbreaks, said Cameron. ""Whats at risk is a disastrous wholesale run of COVID-19 through our population without treatments and vaccines to adequately deal with it.""
The ship has long sailed on keeping this outbreak under control. It's different than SARS and many past influenzas, which we have contained and treated. Virologists, immunologists, and public health experts now have a historic task ahead in finding ways to manage this novel coronavirus pandemic and, inevitably, future ones."

According to The Guardian, the UK's NHS may also be developing a WhatsApp chatbot to share reliable coronavirus information. NHS already helps people in the UK find reliable health info via Google, and it has partnered with Amazon on an Alexa-based chatbot, so it could be well-positioned to add a WhatsApp bot.
While WhatsApp started as a messaging service, it has grown into a social network, and it's now used by over two billion people worldwide. It also poses a unique challenge in the fight against misinformation. Unlike other social networks and search engines, its messages are encrypted and untraced. As The Guardian points out, that makes it especially difficult for WhatsApp to crack down on false claims.
Last year, WhatsApp reduced its message forwarding limit to just five people or groups in an attempt to curb misinformation, and in 2018, it banned over 400,000 accounts during Brazil's election by cracking down on ""automated and bulk messaging activity."" WhatsApp has also made it easier to prevent contacts from dragging you into annoying group chats. Chatbots from reliable sources like the WHO could be another way to combat misinformation.
WhatsApp will likely play an important role in the coronavirus pandemic. Hopefully, it is a positive one."

President Donald Trump has been pushing to quickly reopen the country despite the coronavirus continuing to pose a threat, stating that ""when somebody's the president of the United States, the authority is total."" It's a very ""when the president does it it's not illegal"" sort of line. It's also very wrong, as state governments already have individual authority to decide when and how they will reopen an authority Trump erroneously claimed he would give them.
""He's like a boss who thinks he's being generous by telling his employees, 'Hey, when your shift ends tonight feel free to, you know, go home to your families or whatever,'"" said Meyers. ""'I give you the permission to do that.'"" 
Of course, despite Trump's self-proclaimed total authority, he famously didn't accept any responsibility for failures in the federal government's response to the coronavirus. Apparently for Trump, with great power comes no responsibility. He's like a terrible Spider-Man.
Meyers also took a shot at Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, who accused the World Health Organisation of ineptitude because ""this is COVID-19, not COVID-1."" Trump announced earlier this week that the U.S. would be pulling funding from the organisation.

Dozens of clinical trials are enrolling patients and testing drugs originally designed for other ailments, such as Ebola, HIV, malaria, and arthritis. Results will trickle in over the coming weeks and months.
These potential treatments have already been tested in humans for other diseases, and some are already approved to treat other conditions. That means we already know how safe they are for people to take, and what side effects to expect. Therefore, researchers can skip some of the early steps of drug development, and instead move them quickly into human trials testing their efficacy in COVID-19. 
While repurposed drugs can be tested now, they aren't expected to be anything close to a panacea for the virus. The gold standard for halting infectious diseases remains vaccines, which can protect healthy people from getting infected in the first place.
Vaccine research typically takes years. Even under the urgency of this pandemic, US health officials have said it will take at least a year to know if any vaccine is safe and effective.
Other biotech and pharma companies are scrambling to craft new therapeutics. These will be tailored specifically to fighting this novel coronavirus. Even under the most aggressive timetables for clinical testing, those won't be widely available to patients until at least the fall. 
That leaves repurposed drugs as the near-term hope. Here are the top candidates and how they are being tested against COVID-19. These treatments have already been tested in people and are now in late-stage trials to find out whether they work against the coronavirus."

Snap reported that in the first quarter of 2020, its Daily Active Users (DAUs) reached 229 million, a 20% increase compared to Q1 of 2019. The way people are using the platform has also grown: time spent on Discover has increased 35% in the last year, and people created more than 4 billion snaps each day on average (in 2018, that number was 3 billion).
While Snapchat attributes those numbers, as well as positive statistics about revenue and cash flow to investments in product development, distribution partnerships, and more, Snapchat also said that it has seen increased use numbers in the timeframe and areas most affected by coronavirus. It reported that ""communication with friends increased by over 30% in the last week of March compared to the last week of January, with more than a 50% increase in some of the geographies that were most impacted.""
As Mashable has previously reported, Snapchat has been actively rolling out resources, content, and even pretty dang cute stickers to help its community stay informed about coronavirus. 
We are grateful for the opportunity to serve our community and partners during this difficult time, Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO, said in the company's statement. Snapchat is helping people stay close to their friends and family while they are separated physically, and I am proud of our team for overcoming the many challenges of working from home during this time while we continue to grow our business and support those who are impacted by COVID-19.
Over the past year, Snapchat has been rebuilding positivity around the business (and its finances) since its controversial redesign and competition from Instagram tanked users, and its stock price, in the years after its 2016 IPO. It has seen tempered but steady growth worldwide. This quarter, it even exceeded the market's expectations. Predictions that Snap's emphasis on curated information (over Facebook and Twitter-style free-for-alls), advertiser appeal, and just the fact that it's regularly churning out content during a time when people want to watch things more than ever, may be coming true.
Still, Q1 earnings might not reflect the full toll coronavirus has taken on Snap and the economy as a whole. The earnings slideshow concludes: ""Given uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the rapidly shifting macro conditions, we are not providing our expectations for revenue or Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020.""

And now, the test has come back positive: You have COVID-19. 
It's an increasingly common occurrence worldwide. As of right now, there are no drugs that have been clinically proven to lessen the severity or speed up recovery time of COVID-19.
However, most people who are sick from the novel coronavirus have mild COVID-19 symptoms and can recover at home. 
""Self-management at home for mild symptoms would be similar to other colds or the flu: rest, stay well hydrated, isolate away from other family members,"" said Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School. This last bit of advice, self-isolation, is more important with COVID-19 than the flu or cold. 
He said patients can also use over-the-counter medications like Tylenol to manage the fever that often accompanies COVID-19. As for NSAIDs, like Ibuprofen, Advil, and Motrin, ""there had been some debate about if NSAIDs worsen COVID-19 presentation,"" he said. ""We don't know.""
While those sick at home with COVID-19 should sleep alone, be the only person in the home to use a bathroom, if possible, and not leave the house, said Rishi Desai, chief medical officer at Osmosis, a doctor battling COVID-19's spread. Also ""take fluids with a bit of sugar and salt (rather than just pure water). It actually helps your body absorb the water."" 
Regardless of how their case of COVID-19 progresses, patients should keep a close eye on any symptoms that become more severe.
""If symptoms come to include shortness of breath, severe weakness, or even worse, signs of low oxygen like blueness around the lips, then seeking care in an emergency department is very important,"" said Michael Gross, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital. 
In addition to staying quarantined and disinfecting surfaces daily, those sick with COVID-19 should also tell anyone they've come into contact with that they've contracted the novel coronavirus.
""Think hard about anyone you've been around when you've had symptoms as well as in the two weeks before you developed symptoms and let them know that you have COVID-19,"" Desai said. ""Those folks should be aware that they may have gotten exposed to you so that they can self-monitor their symptoms as well. This is called contact tracing. And given how stretched the public health department is right now, it's up to each of us to do our part to help out in that way.""

But doctors who have treated COVID-19 patients have seen a slew of other symptoms that haven't typically been associated with other coronavirus infections.
""Additional symptoms people experience include loss of smell and taste, stomach aches, body aches, and nausea,"" said Dr. Edo Paz, the vice president of medical at telemedicine company K Health. 
Gastrointestinal problems, including nausea, diarrhea, and even vomiting, are somewhat prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Dr. David Hirschwerk, an infectious disease specialist at Northwell Health, New York's largest healthcare provider, said that from what he's seen ""10 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms.""
What physicians don't understand, however, is why there is such a broad range of symptoms — and outcomes — of COVID-19. ""The medical community doesn't know yet why the coronavirus affects people differently, and some more intensely than others,"" Paz said.
But Dr. Rishi Desai, Chief Medical Officer at Osmosis, believes the symptoms and outcomes may directly correlate to how coronavirus moves through each infected person's body. 
""Each person has a unique immune system, and as a result, some people will react very aggressively to COVID-19, and others won't,"" Desai said. ""Symptoms generally correspond to where the virus is located in the body.""
How the COVID-19 virus moves through the human body
Desai said the virus first hits the nose and back of the throat, causing common cold-like symptoms, including congestion, runny nose, and sore threat. That's also when patients will lose their senses of smell and taste. 
Next, Desai said, the virus moves to the lungs, possibly causing shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain. It could then move to the bloodstream, where fever, nights sweats, malaise, and fatigue could result.
""That means that some folks may only get symptoms localized to one region whereas others may get a mixture of symptoms across all of the regions,"" Desai said. Just as concerning, many COVID-19 symptoms can be associated with other ailments, making the illness harder to pin down. 
Symptoms not associated with COVID-19
According to Desai, there are some symptoms that so far haven't been tied to COVID-19.
""COVID-19 doesn't cause focal symptoms affecting the limbs (e.g. left leg pain), doesn't cause focal skin lesions or rashes (e.g. a boil), and doesn't cause chronic symptoms meaning ones that last for months and months,"" Desai said.
Unfortunately, no one can predict how coronavirus will affect them. And that makes prevention all the more important. But experts don't have a silver bullet to guarantee protection. At this point, people just need to practice good hygiene and social distancing.
""Wash your hands frequently using soap and water,"" said Paz. ""And don't touch your face if possible!""

Think again. Those jackpots are going to shrink as the pandemic tamps down lottery sales.
The group that oversees the Powerball game announced Wednesday night that it would cut minimum jackpots in half, from $40 million to $20 million, after there is a winner of the current big prize. The jackpot also could grow more slowly, with minimum increases of $2 million instead of the normal $10 million after each twice-weekly drawing.
“Powerball players in many U.S. lottery jurisdictions are under shelter-in-place orders or recommendations from their governors or mayors, which have affected normal consumer behaviors,” said Gregory Mineo, the director of the Maine lottery and chairman of the Powerball Product Group. “Just like other enterprises around the world that are making adjustments, we are making proactive changes to continue to offer the world’s premier lottery product.”

The other national lottery game in the United States, Mega Millions, is considering a similar move.
“The Mega Millions Consortium has begun internal discussions about potential changes to address the slowdown in sales during the current health crisis,” said Gordon Medenica, who heads the Maryland lottery and is director of the national game.
Medenica notes, however, that Mega Millions has a minimum increase of $5 million after each drawing so is in better position to weather the decreased sales.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.
The move by Powerball won’t affect the current $160 million jackpot, which will continue to rise by at least $10 million until there is a winner. Another thing that won’t change is the odds of winning a jackpot, and they’re puny for both games. For Powerball, the odds are one in 292.2 million, and for Mega Millions they’re one in 302.6 million.
Powerball and Mega Millions are played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is offered in Puerto Rico.

One of the most recent, baseless conspiracy theories surrounding the virus is that 5G networks -- the next generation of wireless technology that's steadily being rolled out around the world -- are fueling the global coronavirus pandemic.
Unfounded claims about a supposed link between 5G and Covid-19 began circulating on the fringes of the internet, where New Agers and QAnon followers perpetuated the hoax that global elites were using 5G to spread the virus. Unsophisticated algorithms amplified those voices and ushered unsubstantiated theories into the mainstream. 
Officials in the United Kingdom have expressed concerns that recent attacks on cell phone towers were motivated by false conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, actor Woody Harrelson and singer M.I.A. are among celebrities and influencers spreading such claims to their millions of followers. 
There's no evidence to support the theory that 5G networks cause Covid-19 or contribute to its spread. But still, it refuses to die. 
Here's what to know about 5G networks, how these false theories came about and why they don't hold up.
There are several theories linking 5G and Covid-19. One simply suggests that 5G networks cause Covid-19, or symptoms of the infection. Another more insidious one is that 5G networks emit radiation that weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to infection.
To break it down, it helps to understand what exactly 5G is.
5G is a next-generation wireless network that is expected to enable a wave of technologies that will change the way that people live and work -- the potential applications include self-driving cars, remote surgeries and automated factories, though it will be a while before we see those kinds of changes.
The big differences between 4G and 5G are faster speeds, higher bandwidth and lower lag time in communications between devices and servers.
5G signals run over new radio frequencies, which requires updating radios and other equipment on cell towers. Carriers building superfast 5G networks have to install tons of small cell sites to light poles, walls or towers, often in close proximity to each other. So far, the networks have mostly been deployed city by city. 
Why people are linking 5G and Covid-19
5G networks began rolling out in cities and countries in 2018, but were more widely adopted in 2019 -- the same year that Wuhan, China, saw the world's first coronavirus outbreak. 
Conspiracy theorists were quick to link the two, ignoring the ever-relevant adage: Correlation does not imply causation. 
People on the internet shared two maps of the United States suggesting areas that had been hit hardest by Covid-19 were also places where 5G networks had been installed. 
Another thing those areas have in common? They're metropolitan areas: large population centers that are more vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus and are more likely to adopt 5G networks earlier.
There are other reasons those suggestions don't hold up. Although Iran has not rolled out 5G, it's one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. 
Upgrades to wireless infrastructure have been falsely linked to diseases before, and the same has happened this time around with the coronavirus.
Many of the 5G/Covid-19 conspiracy theories are linked to groups that have long claimed that wireless airwaves cause cancer, though there is no credible evidence to support this. 
Research shows that radiofrequency (RF) waves given off by cell phones do not have enough energy to damage DNA directly or heat body tissues -- their energy levels are lower even than technologies such as microwave ovens and televisions. What's more, 5G signals are actually worse at penetrating objects than 4G signals, which is why 5G networks require many more, smaller cell sites built close together.
What's being done to limit the spread
Social media and internet platforms have started taking steps to limit the spread of coronavirus misinformation, though some have been slow to act.
YouTube videos that drew connections between 5G networks and the coronavirus have racked up hundreds of thousands of views. But the company initially said such videos were not in direct violation of its policies before moving to ban them Tuesday.
Twitter said it was increasing its use of machine learning and automation to help take down false information. A quick search for ""5G coronavirus"" Wednesday mostly showed tweets from people casting doubt on conspiracy theories and links from news organizations in the ""Top"" results, despite turning up several false theories days earlier.
""We will continue to take action on accounts that violate our rules, including content in relation to unverifiable claims which incite social unrest, widespread panic or large-scale disorder,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""If people see anything suspicious on our service, please report it to us.""
Similarly, a Facebook search for ""5G coronavirus"" yielded mostly reliable information from news organizations, hospitals and health organizations, though false theories can still be found through the platform.
A spokesperson for Facebook said the company is taking ""aggressive"" measures to combat misinformation surrounding the virus, and is ""starting to remove false claims which link Covid-19 to 5G technology"" and which encourage attacks on cellular towers.

Following confirmation that the dogs owner was positive for the virus causing COVID-19, the dog was taken from Hong Kong Island to a nearby animal quarantine facility. Subsequent tests performed on swabs collected from the dogs nose and throat unexpectedly revealed coronavirus.
These results have raised many questions and concerns. Can our dogs really catch the virus? Should we be worried about our pets getting sick? Could dogs spread coronavirus between people?
A positive test for coronavirus in this dog simply means that a small piece of viral genome was detected in a sample. PCR (a test used to detect genetic material) is a highly sensitive method of testing but is unable to tell whether coronavirus was replicating in the dog or whether the dog had simply licked contaminated surfaces in the home.
It is unknown exactly how long the virus causing COVID-19 disease, called SARS-CoV-2, can survive in the environment. A study of other coronaviruses suggests they can remain infectious for several days if the temperature and humidity are right. Given that we dont even know if the virus detected was infectious or not, we have no idea whether virus replication occurred in this particular dog.
We know that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by droplets, so its possible that dogs could act as dirty tissues, or fomites, that walk the virus around if adequate hygiene is not maintained.
Who you calling a fomite? Galina Kovalenko/Shutterstock
Whereas SARS-CoV-2 has the limelight at present, there are actually many different types of coronaviruses, and coronaviruses infecting dogs is nothing new. The first coronavirus to be reported in dogs was back in 1974. More recently in 2003, a novel canine coronavirus causing respiratory disease was identified in dogs in an animal shelter in the UK. This virus has since been reported worldwide.
Although canine coronaviruses are distinct from SARS-CoV-2, dogs are clearly susceptible to this family of viruses. Despite this, there are no previous instances of human coronaviruses infecting dogs or vice versa. For a virus to jump species, there are several hurdles they must overcome.
The major barrier that stops a virus infecting a new type of animal is the host-cell surface. To infect canine cells, SARS-CoV-2 must be able to bind (attach) to canine receptors. Thanks to rapid research, we now know that SARS-CoV-2 uses the proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into cells. Dogs have both these proteins, but they are not identical to the human versions, so the virus may not be able to use them as efficiently.
If we assume that the virus can bind, enter and replicate within canine cells (this is still a big if), then it is reasonable for dog owners to be worried about whether their dogs will become sick following infection. It is reassuring that the Pomeranian at the centre of this media attention has not shown any signs of illness. Though this is a single case study, there is no reason to believe that the human virus should cause disease in dogs at this stage.
To pass on coronavirus, the virus must replicate in dogs at high enough levels to be released from the body. Reports state that only low levels of the virus could be detected in the Pomeranian. How much virus does it take to infect a person? Again, we dont yet know.
We do know for a number of different viruses that, although human-to-dog transmission is theoretically possible, human-to-human spread is much more efficient. We and others have shown that dogs can be susceptible to human norovirus, a major cause of vomiting and diarrhea worldwide. Yet despite millions of cases of this virus each year, only a single definitive instance of human-to-dog transmission has been reported. Full genome sequencing was instrumental in that particular case, and will also be required to conclusively prove a role for dogs in the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Even in the worst-case scenario of coronavirus being able to replicate in dogs at reasonable levels, it is safe to assume that you are much more likely to be infected by your neighbor than your dog. However, it is essential to practice good hygiene around any pets. This will prevent them from inadvertently carrying viruses on their coats and spreading it from person to person. Please cough into your elbow, not on to your dog.

The town has a population of about 8,000 people, and thousands of Orthodox Christian pilgrims visit the 500-year-old holy site each year during the Easter Holy Week. Orthodox Easter was on April 19.
According to the Kyiv Post, the town was shut down on April 21 after more than 90 people contracted COVID-19 at the monastery. Ukrainian officials said numerous people in the town failed to comply with social distancing measures in place during Easter services. 
Several priests who visited Pochayiv Lavra tested positive for the disease, according to the BBC. Four priests who live in the town also tested positive for coronavirus.
According to Ukrainian news agency Ukranews, a monk at the monastery died from COVID-19 on April 14.

Italys government is considering a lockdown of the northern Lombardy region and 11 neighboring provinces to stem the spread of the new coronavirus in the area, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some 10 million people live in the region, which includes Milan. The WSJ says a draft decree of the plan by the Italian Prime Ministers office, requires people living in Lombardy and 11 surrounding provinces to absolutely avoid any movement into and out of the areas. 
Anyone violating the lockdown could be subject to a fine or jail time, and police and possibly the countrys army could be brought in to enforce the terms. If the quarantine is approved, it would go into effect on Sunday, and last until April 3rd, according to the New York Times. The draft decree instructs people to avoid moving within the quarantined areas other than for work obligations and emergencies. 
Italy has been hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with 5,883 cases as of Saturday. The WSJ reports 233 people have died in Italy from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The country has already restricted public events, and ordered schools closed, but the decree would be the largest lockdown in Italy so far.

Google says it saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams just in the past week. Thats on top of the more than 240 million daily spam messages it sees related to the novel coronavirus, the company says. 
The phishing attacks and scams use both fear and financial incentives to create urgency to try to prompt users to respond, Google says. In other words, same email scam, different subject line. 
These scams include impersonating government organizations like the World Health Organization to try to solicit donations or trick users into downloading malware; pretending to have information about government stimulus payments; and phishing attempts aimed at workers who are working remotely. This scammer pretends to be affiliated with the recipients employer:
Google say its artificial intelligence-powered protections filter such threats, and that it blocks more than 99.9 percent of spam, phishing, and malware from reaching our users using AI and other techniques. The company also says it worked with WHO on implementing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to make it more difficult for scammers to impersonate the who.int domain and prevent legitimate emails from the WHO from being caught in spam filters.
The company says in many cases the malware and phishing threats arent new but just existing malware campaigns updated to exploit fear and confusion around COVID-19. The usual cautions apply: dont click links in emails you werent expecting, report phishing emails, and make sure a URL is legitimate before providing any information, since most scammers try to closely approximate real URLs."

This week, a person incarcerated in King County Jail in downtown Seattle was taken to the hospital after they were suspected of having the new coronavirus. The county says there are no cases currently in the jail, but the new virus remains a huge concern for correctional facilities, particularly in outbreak hotspots like King County. With 85 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the county is home to the largest known hotspot of cases of the new coronavirus in the United States. 
Its only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus enters a US jail or prisons, says Tyler Winkelman, co-director of the Health, Homelessness, and Criminal Justice Lab at the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute in Minneapolis. All prisons and jails should anticipate that the coronavirus will enter their facility, and they need to have plans for monitoring and treating anyone who has symptoms, he says.
People regularly cycle in and out of jails and prisons, people who work in them leave and return daily, and visitors regularly stream through. Viruses of all kinds have multiple entry points, and those that enter tend to spread fast. Outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in these facilities, and during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases.
We know the coronavirus spreads quickly in closed spaces, like cruise ships, nursing homes and jails and prisons, Winkelman says. Many people who are incarcerated also have chronic conditions, like diabetes or HIV, which makes them vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19. 
One way to reduce the impact of the virus on jails and prisons, Winkelman says, is to avoid holding people for low-level offenses. In Iran, officials temporarily released tens of thousands of people determined to not be a risk to the public from prisons in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. People who arent a risk to public safety shouldnt be held in a jail just because theyre not able to pay a bond, he says. We are increasing their health risk by keeping them, he says. This is a time to make sure we have as few people at risk as possible. 
In Sonoma County, California, the jail is screening people at booking for symptoms and asking them about their travel history and contact with people who may be sick. Those types of screenings are critical, Winkelman says. It is essential that correctional staff are working with officials to make sure no one ill is entering a facility.
Some jails and prisons in the US may be prepared to screen, monitor, and treat people suspected of having COVID-19. But others are far from equipped to handle it. Health care centers in correctional facilities are often substandard and understaffed, which may mean people held in them arent monitored regularly enough. Symptoms need to be addressed quickly, not once a week or twice a week, Winkelman says. Isolating people suspected of having the virus could also be a challenge in some facilities the Hennepin County jail has four isolation rooms and set up some spaces for quarantines, but other places might not have the same capabilities, he says. 
Homer Venters, former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system, wrote in The Hillthat jails and prisons need to prepare now. [They] need to have a plan in place to identify and house together people with suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 and those who are at high risk of serious illness if they become infected, he wrote. Many facilities struggled to do so during the outbreaks of H1N1, he said, because jails typically house people based on the level of security they need not their health status. 
Standard public health interventions, like flu shots, are even more important during disease outbreaks if fewer people get the flu, they can stay out of health care facilities and leave more resources available for those who really need it. We dont want there to be outbreaks of multiple illnesses at once, Winkelman says. Many jails and prisons, though, dont regularly provide flu shots. Over half of US jails did not receive H1N1 vaccines when they became available. Under 10 percent of people in Maine correctional facilities received flu shots in 2011, which contributed to outbreaks. 
People in jails and prisons also may not be able to regularly wash their hands, which may promote the spread of disease. Hand sanitizer, which contains alcohol, is usually considered contraband. 
COVID-19 outbreaks in and around jails and prisons dont just have health impacts for people within the justice system. If public health officials recommend that courts not meet during outbreaks, people might be held for longer than necessary. It might be challenging for people on probation to meet with supervisors or fulfill community supervision requirements if there are restrictions on movement in an area. It may also mean that there would be less programing and movement within a facility. Likely, at some point, visiting would be shut down, Winkelman says. That can increase isolation and anxiety during a period of incarceration.
Vulnerable communities like people held in prisons and jails are often most at risk during public health emergencies they have fewer protections from an outbreak, and may face more significant fallout from any disruptions in daily life. But protecting communities from infectious diseases means protecting everyone, including those who arent as able to protect themselves. Jail and prison health care is public health. Its community health, Winkelman says.

Image: Amazon
Amazon is building a lab to test its workers for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Its the latest effort by the company to protect workers who are growing increasingly panicked as the virus spreads through Amazon warehouses. 
More than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed cases in the US, according to data compiled by the Financial Times, several with multiple instances of the virus.
In a blog post announcing the effort, Amazon says that a shortage of testing capacity is making it difficult to keep people safe and to get the economy back up and running. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence, the company said. Unfortunately, today we live in a world of scarcity where COVID-19 testing is heavily rationed.
Amazon is reallocating its own specialists to build the lab, and hopes to begin testing soon. A team of Amazonians with a variety of skills from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers have moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative, said Amazon. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our front-line employees soon.
We are not sure how far we will get... but we think its worth trying
Amazon has remained open throughout the pandemic, making it easier for many people to safely follow shelter-at-home orders. But that has put hundreds of thousands of front-line warehouse workers and delivery drivers at risk. To meet surging demand, Amazon announced plans to increase pay and hire an additional 100,000 workers back in March. The company has also been distributing masks, conducting employee temperature checks, and spraying disinfectant on work stations.

Department of Health in Washington State has reported the first death in the U.S. related to the coronavirus. 
10 with 9 posters participating
Health officials in Washington state reported three grim new features of the coronavirus situation in the US Saturday. They reported the countrys first death, the first case in a healthcare worker, and the first possible outbreak.
In a press briefing held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer at Public Health of Seattle and King County, announced that there are three new presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the county, including the person who died. All of the cases appear to be from undetected spread of the new coronavirus in the community. The cases were identified because the state just recently gained the ability to do its own testing.
Two of the cases are linked to a long-term care facility called Life Care in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle. One of the cases is in a healthcare worker at the facility, a woman in her 40s who is said to be in satisfactory condition. She has no known travel outside of the US. The other is a resident of the facility, a woman in her 70s. She is in serious condition.The cases likely represent the start of an outbreak at the facility, which has approximately 108 residents and 180 staff. So far, 27 residents and 25 staff have reported some COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Duchin said.
An outbreak of COVID-19 at a nursing home is particularly alarming since the data on the disease so far has clearly shown that the people most at risk of getting infected and having life-threatening disease are the elderly and people with underlying health conditionssuch as cardiovascular disease, lung conditions, and diabetes.
We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, Dr. Duchin said.
A team from the CDC is on its way to the facility to help manage the situation. This team is expected to arrive in Kirkland Saturday night.
The countrys first reported COVID-19 death was also in King County. The person who died was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. He died in a local hospital in Kirkland, but he was not a resident at Life Care and has no immediately known links to the facility. Health investigators are trying to track down how he was infected. (In an earlier press conference, President Trump had identified the person who died as a woman. That is incorrect. It was a man.)
The new informationa rapid escalation of the situation in the USfollows news of potential community spread in four separate areas of the US: two areas in California, and one in Oregon in addition to the Seattle and King County area.
This escalation raises our level of concern about the immediate threat of COVID-19 for certain communities, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said in the briefing. Still, the risk to the general public not in these areas is considered to be low, she said.
The new information brings the countrys tally to 69 cases and one death. That includes 47 cases in repatriated citizens (44 from the Diamond Princess and 3 from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began)."

Apple’s solution lets the contact tracing happen in the background, but the UK’s app has to be woken up every time the device detects another nearby device running the same software, BBC explains.
By choosing the centralized approach, the NHS is aligning more with Australia than some of its EU counterparts. Australia’s app, which was released over the weekend, uses a mix of Bluetooth and stored contact data on both the app and servers. Germany, on the other hand, has switched its stance and is now pursuing a decentralized architecture, as are Austria, Estonia and Switzerland.
So far, the European Commission and the EU’s data protection watchdog support both models but note that the differences aren’t entirely clear, EUobserver reports. In either case, the challenge will be getting enough widespread adoption for the apps to be effective."

The cancellation of large gatherings in confined spaces was announced by Health Minister Olivier Veran after special government meetings Saturday that focused on responses to the epidemic.
Having previously recommended that people avoid shaking hands, the minister said they should also cut back on “la bise,” the custom in France and elsewhere in Europe of giving greetings with kisses, or air kisses, on the cheeks.
The tightened restrictions on public gatherings had an immediate impact. A major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors was postponed from March to June.
A half-marathon that was scheduled for Sunday in Paris also was cancelled, as was a carnival in the Alpine town of Annecy, Veran announced.
He said other outdoor events and gatherings that might lead to a mixing of people from infected areas could also be canceled.
Public gatherings are being banned completely in the Oise region north of Paris that has seen a cluster of cases, and in a town in the foothills of the Alps that has also seen infections, he said.
As of Saturday, France had registered a total of 73 people infected with the coronavirus, up from 57 on Friday. Of those, 59 people remain hospitalized, two have died and 12 have recovered, the minister said.

The rings aren't exactly comprehensive trackers, but they do record body temperature, heart rate and other vitals. In the near term, they could alert medical workers if they have a fever or impending illness, not just COVID-19. By the fall, when some expect the coronavirus to resurge, UCSF and Oura hope to have an algorithm that will detect early symptoms of the virus, so that people can more effectively self-quarantine.
One of the strategies at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, was to have residents report their temperatures daily and isolate at the first sign of fever. The ring could allow users to do the same. But it would require that they hand over medical data, which opens up data privacy concerns.
There is some indication that this could work, though. Thanks to the Oura Ring, a Finnish business executive noticed that his temperature was higher than normal (about 100.4 Fahrenheit) and his heart and breathing rates were slightly increased. While he reportedly felt normal otherwise, he had just been traveling in a coronavirus hotspot, so he was tested. The results were positive for COVID-19. Without the ring, he wrote on Facebook, he would not have noticed those changes."

""With the adoption of the $200 million COVID-19 Telehealth Program, the FCC can now take immediate steps to provide funding so that more patients can be treated at home, freeing up valuable hospital beds for those who most need them and reducing the risk of exposure to the virus,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.
The FCC approved the funding less than a week after it was announced. But the price for that speed may be a lack of guidance. ""This is a well-intended effort, but it lacks clear performance metrics,"" wrote Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who mostly spoke in favor of the program. ""Moreover, it does not focus on a specific problem in healthcare,"" she added.
The FCC also adopted rules for the Connected Care Pilot Program, a separate, three-year initiative that will provide up to $100 million to help offset the cost of providing virtual care. One goal of the pilot is to determine how the FCC's Universal Service Fund might be used to support long-term telehealth. In particular, that program will emphasize providing care to veterans and low-income Americans.
In light of the coronavirus, Medicare has expanded telehealth coverage nationwide. While Medicare previously covered telehealth in some rural areas, patients still had to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Now, millions of older adults will be able to seek medical advice from the safety of their homes, and with this FCC funding, more healthcare providers will be equipped to provide it."

They’re developing a system, PACT (Private Automatic Contact Tracing), that promises to automatically trace contacts while keeping identities secret.
The system would send Bluetooth “chirps” of random numbers to nearby phones. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload all their received chirps from the past 14 days (about the maximum incubation time) to help others find out if they were close by. If there’s a match between numbers, the passers-by get notifications telling them of possible contact and what to do next. The very nature of the process continuously changes IDs, making it difficult or impossible to link data to a given individual.

For nearly two decades, brands around the world have gathered each year to celebrate two occasions: the anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, and April fools day. Theyre like holidays for the most cringeworthy and deplorable content imaginable, and no natural or human disaster has been able to interrupt them until now.
Google, which typically spends about 40-percent of its yearly budget on April fools pranks across its portfolio of products, wisely opted out this year. According to an email obtained by Business Insider, Google will take the year off from that tradition out of respect for all those fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks, Google.
Unfortunately, some brands lack the self-awareness or plain sense to cancel their pranks, and The Verge has already received a handful of absolutely terrible pitches in the past week that signal more is coming. Were paying attention to the pranks brands pull this year, and were making a list. You dont want your name on this list. We promise: youll regret it.

COVID-19 and its resulting social distancing measures have inspired lots of people to live stream, so Facebook says its going to launch various features over the next couple weeks to make Facebook Live more accessible and easy to use, particularly for people who might not have a lot of mobile data. The updates will be global. 
The team is launching an audio-only mode, as well as automatic closed captions. Its also giving people various ways to access a stream outside of Facebook, including logged-out support, which means people without a Facebook account can still tune into content. This accompanies Public Switched Telephone Network support, allowing streamers to generate toll-free telephone numbers so viewers can call into the audio of a live broadcast.
Other new features are more directed toward the people hosting live events. The companys Stars function, which allows creators to make money over streams, is expanding to musicians and cultural institutions. Up until now, its mostly been used by gamers. The expansion is clearly a nod to other streaming platforms, like Twitch, where artists have been hosting live, donation-based streams. 
Additionally, Facebook is providing partners, mostly faith-based and education organizations, with mobile phone accessories to help them go live. Its also launching a live producer feature for more professional setups that require a connected camera and software encoder. The company says this feature will make managing live streams easier and includes tools like comment moderation, overlays, and clipping."

At that pace, it would take more than four years to test every American.
""This is a start but [the White House is] not yet serious about keeping [the] economy open,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said on Twitter. ""I don't get it.""
Experts agree that widespread testing is crucial in order to safely lift lockdowns across the US. Local health authorities must be able to test widely for COVID-19 in order to track the pathogen's spread through the population as people mingle and go back to work. That way, states, counties, and cities can isolate infected people and impose new restrictions if necessary to slow the virus's spread before cases overwhelm local hospitals.
But to hit that goal, the White House's new plan is ""inadequate,"" Jha said, noting that it could result in a disastrous surge in cases that would force another lockdown.
""If you're not testing and people are getting sick out there, then by the time they show up to your hospital, you have a huge wave coming and it's too late,"" he told Business Insider. ""That's what happened to us the first time.""
The White House plan could force another lockdown in 2 months

To open the country quickly and safely (given current testing capacities) Jha has recommended a ""bare minimum"" of roughly half a million tests per day — enough for 4% of the US population each month.

Something is loading.
""I don't know, right now, how to get up to 10 to 20 million times a day,"" Jha said. ""With 500,000 to 700,000 a day, we have a shot of opening the economy and keeping it going for more than six weeks or two months. If we don't do this, we're going to basically find ourselves with large numbers of cases and having to shut down again in two to two-and-a-half months.""
The White House plan falls far short of that, providing only enough tests for roughly 200,000 Americans each day, and also does not provide a clear timeline or roadmap for exactly when testing would ramp up or how tests would get distributed to states.
Many states have their own testing infrastructure, but even assuming the White House tests were added to that existing capacity, it still wouldn't meet Jha's goal. The COVID Tracking Project reported that 1.5 million tests conducted nationwide last week — roughly 200,000 each day.
Plus, Jha said, even more testing will be needed in the early fall, when the virus could make a resurgence as flu season begins.
""If we go into the fall with 500,000 [daily tests], we're going to get crushed,"" he said. 
Still, he added, ""I am more optimistic we'll have 10 million tests a day in September than I am we'll have 500,000 tests a day in May.""
It will take more than testing to avoid a 'super costly' shutdown

Testing alone is not enough to protect the US from another disastrous surge in coronavirus cases. To contain new outbreaks, experts say, the country also needs an army of contact tracers to track down anyone who came into contact with an infected person. Those contacts must be informed of their exposure and self-isolate for 14 days.
""If all you're doing is testing, then you're just going to spot it getting worse and there's nothing you can do to stop it and cut off transmission,"" Jha said. ""So there it's not just how many tests you have, but what services you have to back up those tests.""
On Monday, a bipartisan group of public health experts wrote a letter to Congress proposing a $46.5 billion plan to safely reopen the economy. The plan emphasized three major spending areas: expanding the contract-tracing workforce, transforming vacant hotels into self-isolation facilities, and offering $50 a day to people who voluntarily self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected person.
Such measures could help prevent a future lockdown once the virus starts spreading again.
""It's going to be super costly over the long run to have to shut down again,"" Jha said. ""Don't shut down again. Don't find yourself in the same place that we found ourselves in a-month-and-a-half ago."""

The data, which does not include every European nation, was released Thursday during the WHO daily press briefing. 
""This is an unimaginable human tragedy,"" Kluge said. ""To the many who are experiencing this loss, my thoughts are with you."" 
Residents of nursing homes, often those who are of advanced age and have underlying mental and physical illnesses, are at an elevated risk of being infected and suffering from complications related to COVID-19. 
Many nursing home residents have also gone without visits from their friends and family as lockdown orders are in place, adding more emotional toll on them, Kluge said.
Still, even ""the very old"" and frail have a good chance of recovery, ""if they are well cared for,"" Kluge said.
""This pandemic has shown a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued in corners of all society,"" Kluge said.  ""Across the European region, long-term care has often been abhorrently neglected, but it should not be this way."" 
Kluge went on to call those who work direct care in nursing homes the ""unsung heroes of the pandemic"" and note that they are stretched thin and underpaid. 
Despite many countries locking down their long-term care facilities early and preventing visitors, infections have still been spreading within them.
Going forward, and in the post-COVID world, Kluge said that nursing homes need to empower care workers, change the environment they work in, and have comprehensive plans to prevent and control infections. 
""We much do all we can to ensure that those workers have personal protective equipment and other essential supplies to protect themselves and those they care for,"" Kluge said. 
Senior Emergency Officer for WHO Catherine Smallwood was asked whether the WHO recommends every resident and employee of a nursing home be tested for the coronavirus. She said that at this time, the agency is recommending that all suspected cases be tested. 
Some countries are taking a broader approach to testing, she said, ""but that needs to be carefully balanced with the countries testing capacity overall."" 
The disproportionate deaths in the nursing home setting aren't isolated to Europe. The United States has also seen severe outbreaks in long-term care facilities around the country.
Early on in the US infection, nearly 20 percent of all the US deaths were tied to a Seattle area nursing home. 
Earlier this month, health officials discovered 17 bodies piled up in a small morgue of a New Jersey nursing home.

The federal agency said in a statement: ""We have become aware of a number of Internet promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure coronavirus, and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result.""
SEC officials added that investors should ""be cautious of claims that a company's products or services can help stop the coronavirus, especially claims that involve microcap stocks.  These claims may be made as part of fraudulent 'pump-and-dump' schemes.""
The regulator highlighted the risk of coronavirus-related fraud back in February when the virus started spreading across the world.
The SEC can stop a stock from trading for up to 10 days if it believes information posted by a company is inaccurate. A halt prevents investors from selling their shares for at least the duration of the trading suspension.

Among the 23 companies affected, the SEC halted trading of Predictive Technologies Group's shares on Tuesday. All the companies are listed here. 
The SEC said micro-cap stocks are most vulnerable to coronavirus fraud and fraudulent investment schemes, including coronavirus-related scams. 
They face greater risk because there is usually limited public information about microcap companies' management, products, and services. 
""This can make it easier for fraudsters to spread false information about the company and to profit at the expense of unsuspecting investors,"" the SEC warned.
The agency specifically cautioned of 'pump and dump' schemes, where promoters 'pump' or inflate the stock price of a company by spreading positive or incorrect rumours. 
""These rumors cause many investors to purchase the stock,"" the SEC said. ""Then the promoters or others working with them quickly 'dump' their own shares before the hype ends.""
Usually after the promoters profit from the scale, the stock price tanks, hurting other investors."

The story that truly mattered in tech yesterday was, of course, the coronavirus. Another big conference got canceled, Google I/O in May. That means the big, uncanceled tech events include Apples WWDC and its rumored spring event, Microsofts Build, and of course SXSW. SXSW starts next week and despite the fact that yet more companies pulled out of it (including longtime SXSW stalwart Mashable), the conference itself hasnt come around to canceling. Well see.
Since the big cancellation came from Google, Im going to steal one of Googles favorite cliches: its still early days for this virus. Yet more cases are being discovered in the US and that pace will likely increase as testing does. What the effects on big tech will ultimately be is still unclear.

Dubbed 'COVID Toes' by the dermatology community, this symptom could be the latest indication that you should get tested for coronavirus. Others have included anosmia, or a loss of smell, and conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, which the American Academy of Ophthalmology recently suggested could be a sign of the virus.
The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) launched a registry last week to track the dermatological effects that COVID-19 virus patients may be experiencing and received over 200 submissions from healthcare providers as of Wednesday afternoon. 
Dr. Esther Freeman, a dermatologist and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a faculty member at Harvard medical school, is managing the registry in collaboration with the AAD. So far, Freeman told Business Insider, around half of the cases in the registry note these lesions in the hands or feet that resemble frostbite. 
Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.
She's also seen several of these cases in her own patients in recent weeks. She said she connected with patients through virtual consultations.
""My message to the public would be, if you develop these, talk to your healthcare provider,"" Freeman said.
If you go to a doctor, they'll ask questions about whether there may be any other reasons why you would be developing these lesions.
""In the absence of another reason to have these 'COVID toes,' you may want to consider testing and think about potentially limiting the risk of spread to other people,"" she said.
An example of ""COVID Toes""
Dr. Lindy Fox
What causes COVID toes?
A lot is unknown about what may be causing this condition, Freeman said. She said there are a few main theories circling in the medical community.
One of the theories is that the lesions may be due to the virus causing general inflammation in the body. Another is that the virus may be causing vasculitis, meaning the walls of the blood vessel themselves are becoming inflamed. A third possibility is that the lesions may be caused by blood clots in vessels in the skin. Doctors are increasingly seeing blood clots as a complication of the virus.
But it may end up that more than one of these hypotheses ends up being true, Freeman said. It could be a combination of these things or some patients may experience 'COVID toes' for one of these reasons while others may experience them for another.
""It's possible that it's a spectrum,"" she said.
Interest from the medical Twitter community
Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an infectious disease specialist in Edmonton, Alberta, recently posted a tweet about 'COVID Toes' that has garnered over 2,300 retweets and 3,500 likes on the site. 
—Ilan Schwartz MD PhD (@GermHunterMD) April 14, 2020
Schwartz told Business Insider that though he hasn't yet seen COVID-19 patients with swollen toes in his own practice, what he has seen is immense interest from the medical community in the topic. He said he's had several people leave comments on his post and send him private messages relaying their own experiences with the symptoms. 
In a recent webinar where Schwartz was presenting on the virus to family doctors in Calgary, Schwartz said that an audience member also raised the question of whether he or others had seen lesions in the toes of coronavirus patients. 
Schwartz said that though it's still early and the cases are mostly anecdotal, he feels quite certain that the frostbite-like toes in some COVID-19 patients are a sign of the disease. 
""But it's going to take a very large population that is surveyed to be able to make any definitive findings, and that might still take a while,"" he said. 
Patients with COVID toes tend to be younger, and may not have other symptoms
Most COVID-19 patients experiencing painful and swollen toes seem to be younger, said Dr. Lindy Fox, a professor of dermatology at the University of California at San Francisco, who is also involved in the AAD's registry. Many of them also appear to be relatively healthy and show few or no other symptoms of COVID-19.
Fox suggests that anyone experiencing these symptoms be tested with both a test to see if they're currently infected, and an antibody test, which shows if they were infected previously. However, she notes that the inflamed and purple toes themselves aren't necessarily indicative that someone may develop other serious symptoms of the virus. 
The toe problems can show up during or after the other coronavirus symptoms have subsided, Fox said. 
COVID toes may reveal the scope of exposure to the coronavirus
These frostbite-like symptoms can happen for reasons unrelated to the coronavirus, especially during the winter or in areas with cold climates. However, the sheer number of cases of these toe problems, called pernio, that the medical community has seen, especially in countries like Spain and Italy that have warmer climates, has prompted doctors to consider the cases as related to the virus. 
""It is an astonishing number"" of patients who have these symptoms in their toes, said Fox.
She said that the lack of  testing for the virus means we don't really know how many people have had it, and these toe problems are another indication that the virus is widespread.
""We're understanding that many more people than we ever thought were exposed to the virus, had it, because our testing has been so poor,"" Fox said.

The facility is one of the biggest auto-manufacturing plants in the world. The closure represented the longest it has ever experienced in its eight-plus-decade history.
In attempts not to endanger or risk the health of its hundreds of thousands or workers, the German automaker is making ""100 changes"" to the way its factories will operate as business resumes, reports CNN Business.
Production will build up gradually, according to the outlet, and follow closely to parts availability, government regulations, and car demand, which nosedived this year thanks to the pandemic. Volkswagen says it expects to build about 1,400 cars at the Wolfsburg plant this week. That number will go up to 6,000 cars next week, which is only about 40% of the plant's normal output.
Shifts will also be affected. Rather than the usual 20,000 workers, Volkswagen is restarting with one shift of 8,000 production line workers. They will see reduced hours in the beginning and changes in shifts so people coming in don't meet those exiting. 
It will be a massive undertaking. Per the story:
Workers will be expected to check their own temperature and change into their uniforms at home each morning, rather than on site. They will be asked to use elbows to open doors and walk in single file once inside, following markers on the floor to keep space between people.
Social distancing will be enforced during team meetings and over lunch breaks, with reduced seating in common areas and conference rooms converted into office spaces. Canteens will remain closed and workers asked to bring their own lunch. Water dispensers have been temporarily removed to reduce the likelihood of infection and air conditioners set to circulate as much fresh air as possible.
Tools will be disinfected after every shift and workers will no longer pass them to one another by hand, instead setting materials down in containers so that others can pick them up at a safe distance. Several hundred additional hand washing facilities are being installed throughout the plant.
There will also be more space between cars on the factory floor, with employees performing their jobs on the same car ""separately where possible."" If it isn't possible to stay five feet apart from each other, employees will need to wear masks.
Volkswagen also works with thousands of suppliers, and CNN reports it has brought over 40,000 of them up to speed on its 100-point safety plan. It notes that around 2,000 trucks would typically bring 21,000 raw materials and car parts to the Wolfsburg plant per day before the pandemic. 
With the new safety measures, delivery drivers will have to stay in their vehicles. The machines used to unload the cargo will be cleaned more often.
Volkwagen shut its Wolfsburg plant on March 18. The plant itself is among the largest in the world and covers 70 million square feet. In 2019, it produced around 700,000 cars, which breaks down to about 3,500 cars a day. It was opened in 1938 and currently employs about 63,000 people.
Ceasing production in Europe and the Americas during the pandemic reportedly cost the automaker $13 million an hour, or $2.2 billion per week.
Volkswagen did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for additional comment on the matter.

Airlines have largely cut their daily flight schedules in response to the virus' decimation of the travel industry but provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act have required airlines that are receiving aid to continue flying certain flights to maintain national connectivity. Non-essential leisure travel, however, has largely ceased thanks to mandatory quarantines and stay at home orders. 
Take a look at which airports have been affected most by the deadly virus that has taken the lives of four TSA employees."

Protective medical gowns are in such short supply in the Mount Sinai system that some nurses have started to use ""Hefty"" brand garbage bags instead, according to photos on social media.
The New York Post reported that Kious Kelly, an assistant nursing manager at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, died on Tuesday. Kelly was 48 years old.
His sister confirmed his death to The Post, saying she was told he had been in the ICU, but that he did not think it was serious. The Post did not specify how he contracted the virus.
""We are deeply saddened by the passing of a beloved member of our nursing staff,"" Renatt Brodsky, a spokesperson for the Mount Sinai Health System told Business Insider in a statement. Brodsky did not provide any further details.

All studies included women and babies in China, and two of the studies used a type of testing that wasn't available before February. 
The first case report, published in the medical journal JAMA, included a mom and her infant. Researchers found that two hours after birth the baby had elevated levels of certain antibodies — proteins the body produces in response to an outside pathogen like a virus — associated with COVID-19. 
The higher levels of one particular antibody, known as IgM, was notable because it's too large to cross the placenta, indicating that the virus crossed the placenta and triggered the higher levels in the infant. 
While it's possible the infant was infected some other way, it's unlikely because the baby was delivered via Cesarean section, the mother wore a mask, and the two were separated immediately after birth.  
The baby had no symptoms of COVID-19 at birth and after staying in a children's hospital for almost a month, was discharged from the hospital March 18. 
The second report included six infants 
In the second JAMA report, this one looking at six mothers and their infants, researchers found that all babies had elevated antibody levels associated with COVID-19, and two of them had higher-than-normal levels of IgM, again suggesting that the virus had crossed the placenta. 
Like the single case study, the newborns tested negative for the virus using the methods available prior to February, and none had symptoms as of March 8. 
Both studies were small and had other limitations, but provide more detailed evidence that it may be possible for COVID-19 to cross the placenta. 
Crystal Cox/Business Insider; Samantha Lee/Business Insider
The third report was larger, but had more lag between birth and testing
The third report, published in JAMA Pediatrics, included 33 infants whose moms had COVID-19. Using the older testing method two days after their birth, researchers found that three of the infants tested positive for the virus.
Because the moms and babies were under ""strict infection control and prevention procedures"" so that the newborns wouldn't be infected after birth, the authors say it's likely they were infected through their mothers.  
All of the babies survived, and it's unclear if the coronavirus actually caused the symptoms in the baby who was most ill.
Taken together, though, the three studies ""suggest to me that the virus can cross the placenta,"" Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrician and a professor at the University of Florida, told STAT. 
Past research using different testing methods indicated the virus couldn't cross the placenta
Past research, though limited, has suggested that pregnant women with COVID-19 can't pass it on in utero. A Lancet study of nine pregnant women in Wuhan who had COVID-19 found their babies tested negative. There was no evidence of the virus in breast milk, amniotic fluid, or cord blood, either. 
A March 16 case report in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics looked at four infants born to women in China who had COVID-19, and found that the three who were tested didn't have the illness, and all were healthy other than rashes and a temporary breathing condition. 
Of the 34 cases of babies born to women with COVID-19 that were discussed in a March 12 CDC seminar, none tested positive for the illness.

Advice for pregnant women remains the same 
While pregnant women don't appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still considers them an at-risk population since any respiratory infection increases the risk of complications. 
As such, pregnant women should stay home as much as possible, practice excellent hygiene, avoid people who may be sick, and consider virtual prenatal visits when offered. 
Those already diagnosed with COVID-19 should plan to give birth in a hospital, which must follow CDC recommendations for managing pregnant women and their newborns to reduce the risk of transmission after birth. That may mean putting moms and their babies in separate isolation rooms, or keeping them six feet apart. 
As more research comes out on how the coronavirus affects pregnant women and their babies, do what you can to manage stress and anxiety about the unknown, including by reaching out to professionals or loved ones for support. 
""There are going to be a lot of emotions, some of which are sadness, grief and the unknown,""  Dr. Jane van Dis, an OB-GYN who serves as medical director at the telemedicine network Maven, previously told Business Insider. ""Just know that connecting with people who are there to support women is essential for mental health.""

Demand is high across the nation, but she already has mounds of paddy rice that are going nowhere amid the COVID-19 lockdown. 
“I can’t mill because the marketers are not coming,” Yialase said, referring to wholesale buyers, as she sat at a market stall in the city of Makurdi with dozens of other millers. 
Although food truck drivers are meant to be exempt from lockdown restrictions, many are afraid for their own safety, or fear they will be fined or arrested by overzealous police. 
The situation in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is reflected across sub-Saharan Africa. 
Trucking logistics firm Kobo360 said 30% of its fleet across Nigeria, Kenya, Togo, Ghana and Uganda was not operating as a result. Several farmers said crops were rotting in the fields or at the depots waiting for trucks that never arrive. And millers cannot get their milled rice to buyers. 
“There is no clarity around what can move around ... or what is essential transportation,” said Kobo360 co-founder Ife Oyedele, adding that truck bosses were afraid. “They’re scared to go out and have their drivers on the road.” 
Millions of people in the region are at risk of not getting the food they need due to coronavirus disruptions, according to the United Nations and World Bank. 
While domestic crops and capacity go to waste, the imports the region relies on have also dried up as major suppliers, including India, Vietnam and Cambodia, have reduced or even banned rice exports to make sure their countries have enough food to cope with the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, scarcity has driven up prices of the main staple food beyond the reach of some people since lockdowns were announced in three states at the end of March to tame the spread of the virus. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, the world’s largest rice-importing region, could be heading from a health crisis straight into a food security crisis, the World Bank warns. 
More widely, the United Nations says coronavirus disruptions could double the number of people globally without reliable access to nutritious food, to 265 million. 
“There is no question about it that there is an imminent problem of food insecurity, not only in Nigeria, but also in nations all over the world,” Nigeria’s Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono told Reuters. 
(GRAPHIC: Top Regional Rice Importers 2018 - here) 
STRATEGIC RESERVES 
Nanono said Nigeria had at least 38,000 tonnes of grains in government-controlled strategic reserves. It is looking to replenish with 100,000 additional tonnes. 
However the region has among the lowest inventories relative to consumption, so export restrictions mean rice shortages “could happen very quickly,” according to John Hurley, lead regional economist for west and central Africa for the U.N.’s International Fund for Agricultural Development. 
(GRAPHIC: Months of crop use held in stocks by region - here) 
Nigeria has substantially increased domestic rice production in recent years. But figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) show it still imports at least a third of what it consumes. Across sub-Saharan Africa, countries rely on imports for roughly 40% of rice consumption. 
This puts these countries at particular risk. 
India, the world’s largest rice exporter, temporarily stopped new export agreements earlier this month, while lockdowns and supply chain disruptions in Pakistan, Vietnam and Cambodia have limited available exports. 
Since only 9% of global output is traded internationally, the curbs hit prices immediately, the USDA said. 
“We need to make sure we’re not taking policy measures that are going to hurt the rural poor and people in developing countries, said Hurley. 
The price of a bag of imported rice rose by more than 7.5% in Abuja and Lagos between the third week of March and early April, according to SBM Intelligence, while bags of local rice became about 6%-8% more expensive. 
LOCUSTS PLAGUE 
In Kenya, panic-buying and government programmes to distribute rice to low-income households have already depleted reserves. 
If imports don’t pick up, East Africa alone could face a shortfall of at least 50,000-60,000 tonnes by the end of the month, said Mital Shah, managing director of Kenya-based Sunrice, one of the region’s largest rice importers. 
“The entire supply chain has been disrupted,” Shah said. “In the next couple of weeks, East Africa is going to have a huge shortage.” 
Getting the bills of loading for imports into Kenya has also stretched from three to four days to three to four weeks. In Nigeria, clearing imports has gone from weeks to months. 
Senegal’s rice imports have fallen by around 30% due to international supply disruptions, said Ousmane Sy Ndiaye, executive director of UNACOIS, a Senegalese commerce industry group. He estimated the nation had enough in storage to cover two months. 
Growing rice in nations outside East Africa, such as Nigeria, is also more important now due to a plague of locusts in East Africa that has decimated crops this year. 
(GRAPHIC: Regional Rice Production 2018 - here) 
BROKEN CHAINS 
Domestic movement restrictions and import delays are also hindering farmers, and some are warning that production will fall if governments do not act. 
A survey by AFEX Commodities Exchange Limited, a Nigerian company that assists the agriculture sector with logistics and financing, found that Nigeria’s fertilizer stocks are currently 20% below normal levels. There are only enough seeds and other inputs to farm 1 million hectares out of the roughly 30 million typically farmed, the study showed. 
Other farmers say the lockdowns are hindering farm inspections by banks, putting their financing at risk, and creating problems physically getting tractors - which are often hired - to fields. Planting rice would typically start in May. 
“Most people in the industry I speak with are worried,” said Dimieari Von Kemedi, managing director of Alluvial Agriculture, a farm collective. 
Nigeria’s government has created a task force to minimize the coronavirus’s impact on agriculture. Nanono said it was creating ID cards for those in the agriculture sector, from farmhands to food truck drivers, to enable them to move freely. 
He said the government was taking steps to make sure farmers, millers and marketers could operate. The agriculture ministry is working to increase locally produced fertilizers, while the central bank would look to expand financing for farmers, he added. 
Help cannot come soon enough for Yialase in Benue, who is awaiting the day marketers return. 
“When they start to come, I can mill everything here, and they will buy.”

Even now, some people who die at home or in overburdened nursing homes are not being tested, according to funeral directors, medical examiners and nursing home representatives.
Postmortem testing by medical examiners varies widely across the country, and some officials say testing the dead is a misuse of scarce resources that could be used on the living. In addition, some people who have the virus test negative, experts say.
As a result, public health officials and government leaders lack a complete view of the pandemics death toll as they assess its course and scramble to respond.
Do you know someone who may have died of covid-19? Help The Post track the uncounted.
Scientists who analyze mortality statistics from influenza and other respiratory illnesses say it is too early to estimate how many fatalities have gone unrecorded. For a disease with common symptoms such as covid-19, they said, deaths with positive results almost certainly represent only a fraction of the total caused by the disease.
Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.
You cant rely on just the laboratory-confirmed cases, said Marc-Alain Widdowson, an epidemiologist who left the CDC last year and now serves as director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Belgium. Youre never going to apply the test on everybody who is ill and everybody who dies. So without doubt its a truism the number of deaths are underestimated globally because you dont apply the test.
Clay Marsh, West Virginias coronavirus czar, acknowledged that the states count is presumably incomplete. West Virginia was the last state to report a case of the virus and had recorded only two deaths as of Saturday.
Based on the best recent information about limited testing and sizable false negative rates of testing, we are likely underestimating the number of deaths, said Marsh, vice president and executive dean for health sciences at West Virginia University. The count is also low in West Virginia, Marsh said, because the state has a small, rural population and had closed schools and nonessential businesses early.
The CDC has launched an effort to use national data on illnesses, hospitalizations and death certificates to estimate covid-19 infections and deaths. The agency already publishes such estimates weekly for flu, where laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths similarly represent only a fraction of the total attributable to the disease.
Were probably getting more information on covid-19 because theres a greater awareness in the community of what it is, Nordlund said.
The CDCs official death count, which is based on reports submitted by states, stood at 6,593 as of Saturday. Because of a lag in reporting, the number was significantly lower than the more frequently updated counts by media organizations and university researchers. The Washington Posts own count of fatalities surpassed 8,000 on Saturday.
The federal governments death count is broadcast around the world daily as an indicator of how quickly the virus is spreading and how profoundly the nation is struggling. It has clear political implications for President Trump, whose approval ratings rose in late March despite his having downplayed the viruss dangers for weeks.
On Wednesday, the White House estimated that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans may be killed by covid-19, far exceeding the nearly 60,000 combat troops killed in the Vietnam War. Scientists said they did not know how the White House had arrived at its projection, and the White House has declined to provide details.
The death toll has become a heavily politicized benchmark. Trumps defenders claim the official number is inflated because it includes all deceased people who tested positive for covid-19, even if there was another cause of death, such as a heart attack or an accident.
Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, said there are probably some people dying with covid-19 who are not dying of covid-19. Such misattribution is a problem for any cause of death, he said, but it is a minor issue that is swamped by the opposite problem: deaths that are caused by covid but never attributed, so the death count is underestimated.
Around the globe, public officials are questioning whether the number of deaths officially attributed to the virus are deceptively low.
In northern Italy, the town of Nembro recorded 31 deaths from the virus from January to March. But Mayor Claudio Cancelli recently said the total number of deceased in that time period 158 was four times higher than the average for that time of year.
The difference is enormous and cannot be a simple statistical deviation, he wrote in a newspaper article co-authored with a medical executive.
The number of deaths in France attributed to the virus soared last week after officials began including previously unreported deaths in nursing homes, boosting the count by more than 2,000.
Observers inside and outside China, where the virus first appeared late last year, have accused the ruling Communist Party of reporting artificially low infection and death rates. Media outlets, including The Post, have reported that a count of cremation urns ordered to Wuhan, in central Chinas Hubei province, indicates that far more people died of covid-19 than the official death toll of about 2,500.
Trump said Wednesday that Chinas numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, and Im being nice when I say that. Chinese officials denied the accusation, saying U.S. officials were trying to deflect responsibility for the American body count.
Studies of influenza have found that, in the middle of a pandemic, real-time fatality counts are often misleading.
Widdowson, the former CDC scientist, was part of a team that estimated global deaths from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The World Health Organization recorded only 18,631 people with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses dying of that disease. But the pandemic probably caused 15 times as many deaths, the CDC team concluded in 2012.
A 2013 study by government and academic researchers suggested that lab-confirmed H1N1 deaths in the United States represented only 1 in 7 fatalities attributable to the disease.
In the United States, federal and state public health officials for weeks refused to test people unless they met strict eligibility criteria. Testing is more broadly available today, but some experts say the tests may not detect everyone with the virus. Precisely how common false negatives are is unclear.
Postmortem tests for covid-19 are happening unevenly across the country, experts said. Medical examiners, coroners and health-care providers should use their judgment to decide whether such testing is appropriate, according to CDC guidelines.
In addition to the 6,593 lab-confirmed deaths, CDC on Friday reported that death certificate data shows 1,150 people have died of covid-19.
The numbers differ in part because of a lag in reporting, and because the code for recording covid-19 as a cause of death was not announced until March 24, weeks after the first known case of an American dying of the disease caused by the coronavirus. Death certificate data will be part of the CDCs new effort to estimate total covid-19 fatalities.
To estimate the total fatalities from a disease, scientists often look at excess deaths the number of deaths over and above the average number during a particular period.
The most robust estimates require national statistics that in the United States can take two or three years to compile, according to Cécile Viboud, a National Institutes of Health scientist who co-authored the study estimating the U.S. undercount during the H1N1 flu.
The number of initially uncounted flu deaths typically includes people with pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms who were never tested for influenza, as well as a larger number of people who contract the flu and are left more susceptible to dying from such conditions as cardiac arrest, stroke and diabetes. Those people may not be reported as dying of the flu, but the flu still contributed to their death.
Scientists do not yet know whether or how often covid-19 is killing people with these kinds of secondary problems. But it is clear that covid-19 can cause non-respiratory symptoms, scientists say.
Last week, a group of Italian scientists published a study of a 53-year-old otherwise healthy woman who had arrived at a hospital complaining of extreme fatigue. She was suffering from acute heart problems, including inflammation of the heart muscle. She tested positive for the coronavirus.
In Albany, Ga., home to one of the nations most explosive outbreaks, funeral director Jeffery F. Wakefield Sr. said he treats every body as if it is infected with the virus. Wakefield recently handled the body of a young man, around 40 years old, who died at home alone and was not found for several days. The mans death was attributed to cardiac arrest. He was never tested for coronavirus.
Well never really have true, true numbers, Wakefield said. Well get almost close, but well never have the true numbers of who died from this.
Epidemiologists say that patients who need medical treatment for conditions other than covid-19 may also suffer and die in places where the health-care system becomes overwhelmed by the virus.
In the ICU, health-care workers with little to offer covid-19 patients soldier on
Even as testing has become much more widely available, it remains limited in such places as prisons and nursing homes where the disease is spreading quickly. The CDC says hospitalized patients and health-care workers should be at the front of the line for testing. People in long-term care facilities should come next, the agency says.
In New York, the nations largest hot spot, Suffolk County Medical Examiner Michael Caplan said in a memo to funeral directors on Wednesday that nursing homes and hospitals are responsible for collecting samples for postmortem testing.
That is unrealistic, said Michael A. L. Balboni, executive director of the Greater New York Health Care Facilities Association, which represents long-term care residences.
The last thing that a nursing home is going to do is try to determine if someone who has passed away is covid or no covid, he said in an interview. They have their hands full trying to dispose of their remains appropriately. ... Why waste the swabs on decedents?
A Suffolk County nursing home operator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the companys reputation, said some residents are sick with respiratory symptoms, and some have died, but virtually no one is being tested, dead or alive. The exception is when residents are taken to hospitals, the operator said.
Were assuming that everyone is positive, the operator said. To utilize a test on the deceased, its not going to be very helpful. Because at the end of the day, theres a shortage of tests to begin with. We dont have tests. We dont have swabs.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons is no longer testing at a Louisiana prison where a dozen inmates have already tested positive and at least one has died. Sue Allison, a bureau spokeswoman, said that because the virus is spreading inside the facility, any inmate exhibiting symptoms is presumed infected.
Allison said the decision on whether to posthumously test inmates who died of suspected covid-19 would be made with health officials on a case-by-case basis, depending on the availability of tests and other factors.
In most states, people who die at home or have not been under medical care are reported to a patchwork system of medical examiners, lay and sheriff coroners, justices of the peace and other local authorities.
Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, wrote in a news release that the public, in general, does not understand that there is not a uniform death investigation system in the United States. ... So, a uniform response to COVID-19 by Medical Examiners will not occur.
Medical examiners typically investigate accidental deaths, homicides and suicides, and are not going to get involved in a natural death such as that caused by covid-19, said Amy Schaefer, an investigator supervisor for the medical examiners office in Summit County, Ohio, near Akron.
You certainly are going to have numbers that arent being counted because deceased people arent being tested, she said. We need to test people who are still alive.
But in Wyoming the only state that had not reported a covid-19 death as of Saturday Laramie County Coroner Rebecca Reid said she is ready to test anyone with symptoms who dies at home.
We need an accurate cause of death to give the family some closure and make sure they have been safe, she said. Its also very important that the public knows the truth.
She has supplies to test five people, she said.

So to prevent him from spreading the virus, officials are surrounding his house to keep him there. 
The 53-year-old man in Nelson County refused to quarantine himself after testing positive for Covid-19, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. 
Nelson County officials ""forced an isolation"" on the man, one of the first 20 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the state. 
""It's a step I hoped that I'd never have to take,"" Beshear said in a conference on Saturday. ""But I can't allow one person who we know has this virus to refuse to protect their neighbors."" 
Beshear didn't share then how the government had forced the unnamed man to stay in his home. 
But this week, Nelson County Sheriff Ramon Pineiroa told the Kentucky Standard that deputies will park outside of the man's home for 24 hours a day for two weeks. The patient is cooperating now, Pineiroa said.
When reached for comment by CNN, the Nelson County Sheriff's Department deferred all comments to Beshear. 
Nelson County Judge Executive Dean Watts told CNN affiliate WDRB the measure was necessary to keep the community safe. 
""This is about us, not about 'I,'"" Watts said. ""So quarantine is a must. If we have to, we'll do it by force.""
Most state laws for imposing quarantines are fairly broad. Kentucky law gives the Cabinet for Health and Family Services the power to declare and ""strictly maintain"" quarantine and isolation as it sees fit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
The federal government hasn't authorized national quarantines or isolations yet, but President Donald Trump has that power.

So it was a pretty big surprise to read a Windows Central report claiming Microsoft may release the Surface Duoits dual-screen Android phonemonths earlier than anticipated.
When Microsoft announced the Duo and Neoits larger Windows 10X-running siblingin October, the company said the devices would be released during the holiday period of 2020. As much hype as Microsoft built around the devices, thats a long time to wait for any product. But according to Zac Bowden of Windows Central multiple contacts suggest the Duo may actually be available as soon as this summer.
The report claims the hardware and software are pretty much done, and that Microsoft is basically focusing on putting the finishing touches on its Duo-specific features and Android tweaks. The software could be done as soon as April, but a summer launch would likely be primarily aimed at developers and enthusiasts.
[Read: Surface Duo, Neo, and everything else at Microsofts packed hardware event)
Microsoft is expected to announce the Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2 at an event this spring; its likely we will hear more about the Duo there as well.
Another bit of a surprise from the report are the specs; if you were expecting a super-premium phone, it seems the Duo wont be it. Bowden expects the device to come with a Snapdragon 855, 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. While there will be configurations with more storage and RAM, it seems the 2019-era processor is present on all models. Lower performance than 2020 flagships aside, it also means you will likely miss out on 5G
This might disappoint people looking for a premium workhorse phone, but chances are the older processor helps Microsoft keep the price down. It also then makes more sense to release the phone earlier in the year, as the longer Microsoft waits, the more outdated the Duo will seem.
Then again, with COVID-19 causing product delays and event cancellations all over the world, I wouldnt be surprised if the Duos launch ends up being pushed back anyway.

17,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Amir Vahdat and Jon Gambrell / AP,Saudi Officials Ban Pilgrimages to Mecca Over COVID-19,The coronavirus outbreak disrupted Islamic worship in Saudi Arabia as the nation banned residents from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca.,https://time.com/5796035/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-iran-islam-mecca/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-iran-islam.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-03-04T21:42:58Z,"(TEHRAN, Iran) — The coronavirus outbreak disrupted Islamic worship in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran canceled Friday prayers in major cities.
The decisions in Riyadh and Tehran affected both Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike.
The Saudi move expands a ban last week on foreigners visiting Mecca and Medina, home to the holiest sites in Islam. That decision alone disrupted travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affects plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Even after that Feb. 27 announcement, people already in Saudi Arabia could still travel to Mecca’s Grand Mosque, where pilgrims circle the black, cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims around the world pray toward five times a day. The crowds were far smaller than usual before Wednesday’s statement from an unidentified Interior Ministry official that was carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.
Millions attend the annual hajj, which this year is set for late July into early August, and many more visit the kingdom’s holy sites year round. Those other pilgrimages are referred to as the umrah, which drew 7.5 million foreigners in 2019 alone.
It remains unclear how the ban will be enforced. The government described the suspension as “temporary,” but gave no hint at when it will be lifted. The ban also appeared to encompass the Prophet Muhammad’s Mosque in nearby Medina.
The decision seeks to “limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and prevent its access to the Two Holy Mosques, which are witnessing a permanent and intense flow of human crowds, which makes the issue of securing these crowds of utmost importance,” the Saudi government said.
In Iran, authorities halted Friday prayers in all provincial capitals amid the country’s growing coronavirus outbreak, which has killed at least 92 people amid 2,922 confirmed cases. Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside of China.
“This disease is a widespread one,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his Cabinet, according to a transcript. “It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.”
The announcement came a week after a similar order affected Tehran and several other major cities.
While observant Muslims can pray at home, the devout prefer to attend Friday prayers as a community. Iran’s Shiite theocracy also use the services to share ideological messages by clergymen selected by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
There are now over 3,150 cases of the virus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.
Top leaders in Iran’s civilian government and Shiite theocracy have become infected with the virus. The country stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.
Experts continue to worry that Iran may be underreporting its cases.
“The spread of the virus to almost all of Iran’s provinces leave little doubt that the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak,” wrote Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at the risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. “After a slow and politicized response to the outbreak, the government now faces a race against time to prevent a public health emergency from turning into an economic crisis.”
Authorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday.
The video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man’s voice alleging all were “corona-infected.”
Ali Ramezani, the executive manager of the Qom cemetery, later told state television that authorities were awaiting the outcome of coronavirus tests on them before they were prepared for burial. Bodies testing positive are buried by staff wearing gloves and protective gear, and the graves are lined with lime.
“If the test results are negative, then there is no need to bury them based on the protocol for the new coronavirus and the family can receive the body of their loved ones and bury it where they want,” Ramezani said.
Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran’s senior vice president, meanwhile banned all overseas trips for officials to attend international events, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. That did not affect Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh, who traveled with an entourage to Vienna for an OPEC meeting.
Rouhani, in his Cabinet meeting, acknowledged the toll the outbreak was taking on the public. He called on state television to offer “happier” programs to entertain those stuck at home.
“I urge all artists, scientists, psychologists and all who can bring smiles to people’s faces, come into the social media,” he said. “Today, words that make people tired are no longer advantageous.”
His request came as Iran’s judiciary ordered Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof, who just won the Berlin Film Festival’s Golden Bear, to serve a one-year prison sentence over his movies.
In Israel, Chief Rabbi David Lau urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the “mezuzah,” a small item encasing a prayer scroll that is attached to doorposts. Observant Jews typically touch the item and then kiss their hands when walking through a doorway.
The Iraqi Health Ministry said an elderly woman in Baghdad who tested positive for the coronavirus has died. In Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, officials said they suspected a 70-year-old man near the border with Iran also died of the disease, although authorities in Baghdad had not confirmed his infection.
The United Arab Emirates helped evacuate Sudanese students stuck in the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan. They’ll be held in the UAE in quarantine. And Egypt banned Qataris from entering the country following Doha starting a similar ban.

It began offering 4G service at the end of 2015 and, through a combination of low prices and buying the only company with spectrum licenses across the country, quickly grew. Facebook says that “in less than four years, Jio has brought more than 388 million people online,” and now controls more than half of India’s telecoms market. 
It is also, fact fans, the company that first adopted KaiOS, launching the JioPhone, which was given away for free on a number of 4G plans.
But Jio’s dominance -- which Bloomberg describes as being so effective as to turn India's “fragmented telecom market into a duopoly” -- came at a price. The company racked up significant debt, which Livemint says is around ₹40,000 crore (north of $5 billion). That, coupled with the uncertainty around COVID-19, may have been a useful lever to encourage Jio to do business.
And Jio isn't just a mobile operator, but offers fiber to the home, municipal WiFi, as well as a big data, cloud computing and AI division. But the key point of interest for Facebook is both to enable its user count to grow, and to center its platforms as the place for people to communicate and do business. If every bodega, corner store and mom-and-pop shop in India can handle orders through WhatsApp, it elbows-out any competition. 
India has always been one of Facebook’s key targets, given the large population and relative lack of digital infrastructure. As user growth in the US and Europe stagnates, the company has made overtures to China, and India, where Facebook has been pushing hard for traction since 2015. As The Wall Street Journal says, Facebook hasn’t always found it easy in India, where regulators are “hostile to foreign tech firms.” 
Free Basics, for instance, was a Facebook-branded, Facebook-owned way for low-income families to get online. Unfortunately, since Free Basics unsurprisingly prioritized Facebook services over others, it was banned in India for violating the local net neutrality laws. And WhatsApp, which has a reputation for juicing fake news that spills over into real violence in the region, has faced plenty of regulatory ire in the country. More than two years after trialling a payments platform in India, for instance, officials have still refused to allow it to be rolled out nationwide."

The CERAWeek conference is typically attended by more than 4,000 individuals, including energy industry executives, political leaders and reporters. It had been scheduled for March 9-13 and delegates from over 80 countries had been expected to attend.
But IHS Markit, the energy data firm that organizes the event, said it decided to cancel CERAWeek “reluctantly and after deep consideration.”
“Over the last few days concern has mounted rapidly about the COVID-19 coronavirus. The World Health Organization raised the threat level on Friday, the U.S. government canceled a summit meeting scheduled in Las Vegas, an increasing number of companies are instituting travel bans and restrictions, border health checks are becoming more restrictive and there is growing concern about large conferences with people coming from different parts of the world,” IHS Markit said in a statement.
The firm said it had spent the past few weeks focused on safety measures, including setting up medical partnership with one of Houston’s leading hospitals and consulting with experts on infectious disease. But the firm decided the conference — one of the most important annual gatherings for the U.S. energy industry — could not go forward.
“Our number one concern is the health and safety of delegates and speakers, our partners, our colleagues and vendors,” IHS Markit said.
CERAWeek joins other international conferences, including the Mobile World Congress in Spain, that have been canceled amid fears of the virus.
The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 87,000 people globally and caused nearly 3,000 deaths. The first U.S. death was reported on Saturday.

But Dr. Fisher, now a 74-year-old emergency room physician, tweeted Wednesday: ""I am genuinely more concerned about going to work tomorrow morning than I was the day I launched on the space shuttle.""
That's because the coronavirus (which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19) is easily spread, can be excruciating, and is most deadly in people over 60. (Though the pathogen can seriously sicken young people, too). 
Seven crewmembers tragically died when the space shuttle Challenger broke apart after launching in 1986. In 2003, seven more shuttle astronauts perished when the Columbia disintegrated upon returning to Earth. In total, Dr. Fisher wrote that he had a 1.5 percent chance of dying on a space shuttle, which flew 135 missions over 30 years.
Any way you cut it, someone in Dr. Fisher's age group has a much higher probability of dying from a coronavirus infection, which is currently the deadliest infectious disease in the world, overtaking tuberculosis.
Im a full-time ER doc getting ready to work a 24 hour shift in the emergency department. I am genuinely more concerned about going to work tomorrow morning than I was the day I launched on the space shuttle. 1.5% shuttle mortality vs 9-12% if I get COVID-19.

Getting infected at all is often serious. About one in five infected people need to be hospitalized, according to the World Health Organization.
Overall, COVID-19 is certainly deadlier than the flu. Each year, the flu kills around 0.1 percent of those infected. Meanwhile, a new study released on March 30 in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that the overall fatality rate from COVID-19 is 0.66 percent making it over six times more lethal than the flu. Importantly, we're still in the relatively early stages of the pandemic, so this number will almost certainly change and grow increasingly certain as more data comes in. Previously, Anthony Fauci, the well-regarded director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that overall COVID-19 is 10times more lethal than the flu.
But as Dr. Fisher noted, he's in an older age group. 
A recent CDC report found the coronavirus fatality rate is between 3 percent to 11 percent in Americans aged 65 to 84. Three percent is 30 times more deadly than the flu. (Flu deaths in the U.S. are dominated by the elderly, with 70 to 85 percent of deaths occurring in people 65 and older).
""Its not a trivial number.""
""The death rate for people ages 70-79 in Italy has been 12.8%,"" Dr. Fisher tweeted, explaining the mortality numbers cited in his first tweet. ""In China it was listed at 8%. Currently in the US we are somewhere between 4-5%. Of course, nobody really knows. Whatever it is, Its not a trivial number.""
The pronounced mortality numbers for older people (Americans aged 2054 years have a mortality of less than 1 percent) is a critical reason why infectious disease experts implore younger folks to social distance. If they don't, they endanger the lives of older people, like Dr. Fisher.
SEE ALSO: National parks' prized safety system fails during the coronavirus pandemic
""In order for social distancing to work, everyone has got to do it,"" Dr. Timothy Murphy, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Buffalo, told Mashable. ""Its not going to work unless everyone buys into it."" 
But doctors like Fisher are inherently put in high-risk environments, as they're surrounded by COVID-19 infections. 
""Some of your comments question the wisdom of what I am doing,"" Dr. Fisher tweeted in response to questions about why he was risking his life. ""I have been practicing emergency medicine for 45 years. I like it, its interesting, and I have lots of experience. To abandon ship during the greatest public health crisis of our lifetimes is inconceivable to me.""
""Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going,"" former president Barack Obama tweeted in March."

The threat — reported by a Chechen television journalist after a private meeting with the close political ally of Russian Vladimir Putin — was immediately taken as credible in Russian media circles because of Kadyrov's long history of crushing political dissent, and allegedly murdering people who displease him since he took near-total control of the region in 2005. Chechnya is a semi-autonomous republic within Russia's sphere of control.
""The person who creates himself and created this problem, if you ask me, should be killed. Not only he gets sick, [but also infects] his family, his sisters, brothers, neighbors,"" Kadyrov told a television reporter from the Kavkazsky Uzel media outlet. 
Russia has reporting a bafflingly low number of cases, which has left many critics openly speculating about under-reporting or a cover-up. Chechnya, however, has taken aggressive measures to contain the deadly, fast-spreading virus despite only recording three cases so far.
The three cases -- which apparently came from people who had visited Mecca on a religious pilgrimage -- immediately roiled Russia's only Muslim majority province as wild rumors spread on social media and shoppers began to horde supplies. 
Forced confessions on TV
Kadyrov immediately took steps to stop the rumors from circulating, in part by using the time-honored Russian tradition of arresting people and forcing them to confess and apologize on television. Human rights groups fear the confessions were coerced. 
The government also imposed price and market controls to stop hoarding and threatened both shoppers and business with fines and arrests for failure to comply. 
But it was the passing reference to murdering infected people who refuse to self-isolate that has raised the most attention. Kadyrov's previous policies have included rounding up, beating, and jailing LGBT rights activists on vague concerns over HIV transmission. These policies -- that led to at least one murder of an activist were broadly denounced by the international community as having nothing to do with health but rather seen as an anti-gay pogrom in the socially conservative region.
Kadyrov has attempted to assassinate dissidents in Europe
Kadyrov made the statement after reports that one of the infected pilgrims refused to be isolated. The unnamed individual's current fate is unknown. 
Kadyrov has been accused of being responsible for more than half a dozen high profile political murders and even more attempted assassinations of dissidents to his iron rule.
Most recently, those attacks include the mysterious stabbing death of a Chechen dissident earlier this year in France and a brutal attack by a hammer-wielding assailant on another dissident in Poland a few weeks later. The attacker in Poland was detained after being disarmed by his intended victim. The suspect in the France attack escaped but French police told Business Insider that he was believed to be linked to the Chechen security services.

Narrator: As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, more and more cities are escalating their tactics to keep the virus at bay, asking people to socially distance, and, in some cases, to shelter in place. But some are not so lucky to have the ability to work from home. Dr. Eric Cioe-Pena, an emergency physician and the director of global health for Northwell Health, gave us some tips for staying safe at work.
Eric Cioe-Pena: The No. 1 thing to do is wash your hands. Either 20 seconds with soap and water or with a hand sanitizer that's greater than 60% alcohol, because the main mode of transmission is gonna be touching surfaces that someone has coughed or sneezed on and then touching your face. So, that's your first line of defense, is handwashing.
So, comparing hand sanitizer to soap and water, if you have the ability to use soap and water, that's your best bet. So, hand sanitizer is a quick way to disinfect your hands in between soap-and-water washes, but soap and water really does have a greater efficacy in washing away droplets, washing away viral particles, and removing any soil or contaminants on your hands where virus could be hidden underneath. Hand sanitizer essentially is a superficial clean, so if you've got no dirt and no grime on your hands and you use hand sanitizer, it is effective at killing most things that are on your hands, but anytime you have any type of dirt or anything else where something could be hiding underneath that layer of dirt, hand sanitizer isn't gonna get it, but water and soap will. I also recommend, at the beginning of the day, wiping down areas that you're gonna touch often in your work area. So, keyboards, phones, mouse I would disinfect with any household or business disinfectant would work.
One of the other ways to catch the virus is to be in close contact with other people. Being next to another human being for greater than two minutes within six feet who is sick and showing symptoms definitely is a risk. The idea right now is you wanna practice some social distancing between people so that if someone is sick, we're not within six feet of them as much as possible. The other thing is avoiding gatherings of, you know, greater than five people that aren't absolutely essential to business is probably a good temporary measure at this point.
Narrator: But social distancing is not always feasible, especially when your work involves person-to-person contact.
Cioe-Pena: So, the service industry is a tough area. They're especially tough because they also don't have any sick time off, and if they don't work they're not making money, so that's something that society, in general, we have to take a look at, because they really do have kind of a financial imperative to work even while sick. So, the worst thing someone in the service industry could do is work while sick. But the things that they can do to protect themselves: disinfect their hands, make sure that every time they're touching someone else's credit card, touching a check, touching something that another human being has touched in the course of their job, that before they do anything like, certainly, eat or touch their face, that they're disinfecting with soap and water or hand sanitizer.
The handshake is a tough thing 'cause it's really ingrained in our culture, right. I mean, you know, even now when I'm meeting people, part of me is, like, resisting the urge to extend my hand out and shake people's hands. So I think having something that's a gesture, the elbow is certainly, I think, the safer thing than the fist bump, just having that momentary contact with an area that's not gonna go anywhere near your face. You know, even just kind of a slight nod or a bow oftentimes will get kind of the job done.
We need to keep calm. We have to kind of take this with the appropriate level of seriousness, protect the people that are at risk of having worse outcomes, but the rest of us need to just kind of take the anxiety down one notch, realize that we're gonna get through this, it's gonna be here, it's gonna pass through our communities, and so we really just need to kind of do things that are smart, but try to avoid panic."

At this point, it depends what a physician says. Log on to Washington State's health department website and navigate to its information on coronavirus testing and you'll see this:
""People do not always need to be tested for clinical care purposes since there is currently no medication to treat COVID-19.""
Washington, New York, and California are some states that are cracking down on who gets tested for COVID-19. Even those who are sick with mild symptoms are advised to stay home and call their healthcare provider. 
The reasoning for limited testing comes down to the same reason the US isn't faring well in its fight against the novel coronavirus: A lack of resources. 
Specifically, a lack of diagnostic testing materials, like nasal swabs, and a lack of protective equipment for medical professionals. As a result, medical facilities are overrun with cases, which has triggered this need for more limited testing. 
""We don't have enough tests to test everyone and we have to prioritize them for where it matters for care,"" Dr. Emmy Betz, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine told Business Insider. Betz is advocating on social media to get doctors more personal protective equipment to treat patients.
Who should get tested
Every state is a bit different, Betz said. While there are national, state, and local guidelines, there are no ""hard and fast"" rules about who gets a test and who doesn't, which adds to a lot of confusion. 
According to CDC guidelines, those who warrant top priority testing are as follows:
<ul><li>Priority 1: Symptomatic health care workers are a top priority because they could easily spread the virus to others on the job.</li><li>Priority 2: First responders with symptoms are the next priority. </li></ul>Betz said at this point, everyone in the country needs to assume there is community spread. She adds that coming to a hospital to get tested when they are faring okay at home could cause more harm than good. Limited amounts of personal protective equipment means items like masks are not getting changed as often as they should between patients — so coming to the hospital could get you sick even if you weren't already.
Since the severity of COVID-19 cases largely varies across states and cities, the state and local health authorities can adapt the CDC's advice depending on the situation. For more information on whether you should get tested, check your local health department website. 
Limited testing hampers the country's fight against coronavirus
The current limited testing situation in the United States goes against what the World Health Organization advises to stem the flow of this pandemic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on March 16 that testing is the key: ""You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected.""
Moreover, experts say that widespread testing could be our ticket to getting out of lockdown mode — understanding who is sick, who is not, and who has recovered will make it easier to isolate those who need to quarantine versus those who can return to work. But the CDC is not reporting state-by-state testing capacity, which makes it difficult to know the extent of the testing shortfall.  
And this issue of a shortage in testing supplies continues to hamper efforts to contain the pandemic. ""In an ideal world, we would have already had the ability to do widespread community testing, but at this point, we don't have that,"" Betz said.
As more tests become available, another issue is arising — not enough results. 
California got a shipment of 150,000 test kits from Hong Kong and have expanded the number of labs able to run tests. It has added commercial and university labs to the mix — but now the state has a backlog of over 48,000 tests waiting for results.
For now, Betz explained, we need to stay put. ""Two or three weeks ago, if we could have tested every single person, we could have potentially gotten the situation more under control. This did not happen, so this is why the guidance is for everyone to stay home.""

The 40-year-old Democrat already broke US Sen. Joe Manchin's 2005 record for most individual donations in a Mountain State run for Charleston's corner office, and that was back in October.
Now, Smith is channeling that grassroots energy by flipping his field operation into a ""coronavirus crisis response team.""
He still has a primary race to compete in, with voting day moved to June 9, but Smith told Insider that making his campaign's resources available for those struggling from the coronavirus is the current priority.
""It's kind of incredible and radical and beautiful that, I think, we caught on to what was going on fairly early, and decided to act boldly and quickly,"" Smith said in a phone interview Monday. ""And what that looked like was a comprehensive coronavirus resource web page that was up on our campaign website before the state of West Virginia had its own website.""
His campaign has 305 ""neighborhood captains"" across the state who aim to contact around 100 neighbors per week to check in on what they need: food, masks, transportation, help with unemployment insurance, and even assistance with getting registered to vote absentee.
Five days after Smith's campaign launched its coronavirus site, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice told constituents to ""go to Bob Evans and eat"" as he downplayed the severity of the pandemic.
Justice's office did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Smith grew up in the capital city of Charleston before moving to Texas for his high school years, going on to graduate from Harvard University. He then moved to Chicago for his early career before heading back to the Mountain State to raise his family. 
While he may not have the region's accent or boast the flare of fellow WV Democrat Richard Ojeda 's swole campaign videos, Smith is running on an anti-establishment platform, refusing PAC money or corporate donations. 
""Right now — and I think this is increasingly true across the country — West Virginia isn't a red or a blue state,"" Smith told Insider. ""We're a state that's fed up with the establishment of both parties.""
While there has been little polling on the race, Smith has outraised his two closest competitors by far, according to the latest filings, and has been the subject of national coverage in The New Yorker, Yahoo! News and The Intercept.
He's also backed by more than 90 down ballot candidates taking part in West Virginia Can't Wait, a pro-labor reform group that has candidates take a pledge to reject corporate money, refuse to cross picket lines, and pledge to never avoid debating opponents. 
""2018 was a perfect example of this,"" Smith said. ""There were three congressional seats up for election, obviously, and there were viable challengers in every race and there were zero debates — zero general election debates — not one in three races did the two people get in the same place and answer questions. 
""Unbelievable, right?""
Smith had already pledged to donate at 10 percent of his campaign fundraising total to local non-profits and charities, but he said the coronavirus outreach will far exceed that. 
""What matters most is — people have heard every string of words that a politician can say — it's more about what we do.""

Business Insider first reported on the possible rescue fund in March, when investors warned that thousands of startups could collapse thanks to the economic slowdown.
UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak will speak to startup investors and industry representatives on Friday at 3.30pm, and is expected to agree to additional government cash that will be invested into startups struggling during the pandemic.
Industry sources said exact details were not yet clear, such as how much the government would commit to a fund, the terms, and when the fund would launch. 
If Sunak agrees to a startup rescue package, it's possible the announcement will be made on Friday afternoon or early next week.
Those involved in the discussions said a final package could involve a co-investment fund, with the government handing an expected £300 million ($350 million) to the state-owned British Business Bank (BBB).
The BBB would then take applications from startups applying for ""runway"" funding to see them past the crisis, with likely commitments of up to £500,000 per deal. Startups would then need to match the government capital with private capital from individual or venture capital investors.
The investment would be made as a convertible note, which would convert into shares at a valuation discount of 25% at the startup's subsequent funding round.
This would effectively see the government taking stakes in a number of the UK's fast-growing early-stage startups.
However, sources said it was unlikely that governments would continue to hold its equity through later funding rounds. Instead, they said, it was likely that late-stage investors would be given the option to buy the government out.
It's thought that the package under discussion on Friday will only apply to earlier-stage startups, rather than growth-stage ""unicorns"" such as the likes of food takeaway firm Deliveroo or security startup Darktrace.
Separately, 12 fast-growing tech firms wrote to the government earlier in April asking for financial help and warning that the tech sector was ""at risk"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those discussions are still ongoing.
Instead, this scheme will apply to the approximately 1500 early-stage startups that have raised from smaller venture capitalists and angel investors, and can't easily gain access to more cash to keep their doors open during a downturn."

She said her hospital, which went through a month's worth of masks and hand sanitizers in three days, suspects that patients and families have been stealing medical supplies amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The novel coronavirus, which spread from China in late December, has since infected at least 169,000 people in every continent besides Antarctica.
US localities and businesses have taken steps to lessen the disease's spread, so that the healthcare system won't be overwhelmed by new patients. But Business Insider talked to nine nurses in hospitals nationwide, who said equipment shortages are putting their health and that of their patients at risk, as the novel coronavirus continues to spread.
Hospitals cannot limit the number of patients a nurse can legally care for at once in every state except for California, and nurses that care for more than six patients in a day get burned out and cannot provide adequate patient care, according to research from Linda Aikens. Nurses reported grappling with equipment shortages, understaffing, and a lack of coordination on protocols between health systems and the government. 
""I think the real message we need to tell people is that this is the calm before the storm,"" Marcia Santini, a registered nurse at an emergency room in California, told Business Insider. ""We need to keep our healthcare workers healthy, and if they get sick, that would collapse the healthcare system.""
Nurses are facing mask shortages — and they have called on the government and hospital systems for more resources
Santini said her hospital was crowded and nearly filled to occupancy — before the coronavirus outbreak. 
Like Soper, Santini said her hospital has had a shortage of proper medical supplies like gowns and masks. On March 10, the National Nurses United union called on the White House and hospital systems to ensure that nurses have enough protective equipment. A union survey found only 30% of nurses report having enough equipment to deal with the virus outbreak.
Soper works in her hospital's oncology department, where patients receiving bone marrow transplants have severely comprised immune systems. Soper said her biggest fear is passing on the virus, potentially deadly to patients with comorbidities, to her patients. 
""We need to be protected because once you start the domino effect,"" Santini said, referring to one healthcare worker getting sick and spreading the disease to other staffers, ""then you're going to have a staffing crisis.""

Nurses described feeling frustrated at the lack of coordination from hospitals and the government over proper protocol
Monica, a registered nurse who works in a rural hospital in Washington state, identified four patients last week who she thought should have been tested for COVID-19. (Business Insider confirmed Monica's identity before publishing this article).
But due to confusion from the state's Department of Health and hospital providers, none received a test. 
The first man to die from coronavirus in the US lived in a long-term care facility in Washington state. Healthcare workers and other residents in the nursing home were also exposed to the virus.
Monica's hospital, which has already faced staffing shortages, asked her to work extra shifts on top of her six continuous night shifts. Coupled with a lack of proper protective gear, Monica told Business Insider she was frustrated by the lack of coordination between federal and state governments and hospital systems on figuring out coronavirus protocols. 
Marie Spaner, a hospital nurse in the Los Angeles area, told Business Insider that she also felt frustrated at her hospital's lack of planning. Her hospital has not changed cleaning or sanitation protocols since the outbreak, nor has it limited visitors.
""It's frustrating and frightening. If we can't have things implemented properly in the hospital then it's a danger for us [nurses] and to the patients,"" Spaner told Business Insider. ""We're just grossly unprepared.""
Reuters
For nurses themselves, getting sick means losing pay
Many nurses told Business Insider that if they take time off work, they won't get paid.
Carmen Martinez, who works as a nurse in the registry department in a California hospital, said her hospital recently stopped screening patients with fevers below 104 — even if they present other coronavirus symptoms.
Without screening patients for coronavirus when their temperature is below 104 — coupled with the shortages of protective equipment — Martinez said she was worried most about getting sick and needing to take time off work. Two weeks without work means Martinez won't be able to pay her bills.
""I don't think America knows how much how much is at stake for us,"" Martinez told Business Insider. ""We're putting our lives at risk right now. I think everybody needs to remember that we're in the front lines were at risk, but there has to be provision made for us."""

Two anonymous public health officials told the FT that private companies with huge logisitcs networks were being approached and that while initially the project would just be delivering tests to key workers on the frontline fighting the virus, the plan is eventually to roll it out to the general public as well.
One of the officials said that one proposal would make two kinds of test orderable on Amazon's website: The regular test to detect the virus and another to detect whether someone has antibodies against the disease, meaning they already had it and developed an immunity. Amazon's contracted deliverypeople would then take the tests to a private diagnostic company.
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by Business Insider.
Considerable pressure has been put on the UK government to increase its rate of testing for healthcare staff, and a petition calling to test frontline NHS employees as a priority has accrued over 1 million signatures.
Amazon has made enormous changes to its delivery and supply structures in reaction to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The company is having to balance a huge spike in demand for household and medical supplies against the health of its own employees.
The company announced last week that it was on a mass hiring spree, looking for 100,000 new warehouse workers in the US alone. CEO Jeff Bezos put out a personal call on Saturday for restaurant staff who have been laid off to sign on with Amazon, which is now offering an extra $2 per hour to staff."

Face masks ""can be useful to stop the spread from a person with the disease to other people, if the mask is used correctly,"" Kelly said. But for people who aren't infected with coronavirus, masks are said to provide little protection. 
So far in Australia, Kelly reported that 5,544 individuals have contracted the novel coronavirus, and a total of 30 have died due to complications caused by the virus. ""Daily increases are definitely less than they were a week or so ago,"" Kelly said, ""that really talks to the effectiveness of some of the ways we have tried to deal with the virus in the last few weeks."" 
In Australia, Kelly said that the country has made some gains from supplies from overseas and in its efforts to produce its own masks.
Meanwhile, in light of a face mask shortage for the healthcare system in the US, the CDC recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks or face coverings when they go outside to prevent coronavirus spread. The recommendation to wear cloth or fabric face masks was announced by President Donald Trump on Friday and came as emerging evidence suggests people can transmit the coronavirus to others before they even know they've been infected.

These potential treatments have already been tested in humans for other diseases, and some are approved to treat other conditions.

Therefore, researchers can skip some of the early steps of drug development, and instead move them quickly into human trials testing their efficacy in COVID-19. 
While repurposed drugs can be tested now, they aren't expected to be anything close to a panacea for the virus. The gold standard for halting infectious diseases remains vaccines, which can protect healthy people from getting infected in the first place.
Vaccine research typically takes years. Even under the urgency of this pandemic, US health officials have said it will take at least a year to know if any vaccine is safe and effective.

The Times also noted that a recent analysis from Swiss bank UBS found that in the past 30 days, the number of cruise bookings for 2021 are up by 9% compared to the same period in 2020, including a substantial number of people booking brand new cruises as opposed to simply re-booking canceled cruises. 
Indeed, UBS reported that 76% of the people who had a canceled cruise in 2020 have chosen to accept credit towards a future cruise in 2021 as opposed to 24% who accepted a refund. 
The LA Times also cited a poll of 4,600 cruise customers conducted by review site CruiseCritic.com in which 75% of respondents said they planned to continue to book cruises at the same rate as before after the coronavirus outbreak is over, compared to 24% who said they planned to book cruises less often. 
A Harris Poll released March 31 also found that while demand for cruises is still expected to bounce back at a slower rate than for other methods of travel, such as hotel and airline bookings, only 22% of respondents said it would take ""a year or longer"" before they'd get on a cruise again. 
The two biggest outbreaks took place on the Diamond Princess and Ruby Princess cruise ships, both run by Carnival Cruise Corporation. After the outbreaks, Carnival saw its stock price plummet by 80%. 
Most recently, the Holland America ships MS Zaandam and MS Rotterdam docked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after an outbreak onboard the Zaandam sickened dozens of passengers and resulted in four deaths. 
Ruobing Su/Business Insider
In the wake of numerous coronavirus outbreaks onboard, the CDC has banned Carnival, Norwegian Cruises, and Royal Caribbean cruise lines from sailing in US waters until at least July. Those three companies alone represent $60 billion of the cruise line market. 
And because the vast majority of the cruise lines are not incorporated or based in the US  in order to avoid corporate taxes, the industry as a whole was largely excluded from the $2 trillion economic stimulus package President Donald Trump signed into law in March. 
Now that cruise lines have had to cancel voyages or sail empty ships, employees at lines including Holland America, Princess Cruises, and Australia-based P&amp;O Cruises are facing pay cuts and layoffs, Business Insider's Mark Matousek reported on Friday.
""Cruise lines, as evidenced by the stocks, are in a world of hurt right now without a clear light at the end of the tunnel,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Patrick Scholes recently told Business Insider's Meghan Morris, adding that the ""multi-million dollar question"" for these cruise lines' survival is when they can start operations again. 
While cruise lines have taken a severe financial hit and will face serious challenges to get back on track after the crisis, the loyalty of their customer base and the rise in bookings even in the midst of a pandemic that spread on cruise ships show a sliver of hope for an embattled industry.

The outbreak is highlighting ""some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society,"" he added.
New research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts that disparity in stark relief, showing the extent to which black Americans account for more hospitalizations than they should based on their share of the US population.
The report notes that 33% of the US's COVID-19 hospitalizations are black patients, though black people make up 18% of the overall US population.
Andy Kiersz/Insider
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the reason for this disparity most likely has to do with the prevalence of ""underlying medical conditions — the diabetes, the hypertension, the obesity, the asthma."" 
These preexisting health issues put patients at higher risk of developing severe cases.
In some areas, black Americans are dying at higher rates 
The CDC report analyzed 1,482 hospitalizations across 99 counties in 14 states during the month of March. The agency had race and ethnicity data in 580 of those cases; not all states are collecting and releasing that information.
States and cities that are tracking the racial breakdown of coronavirus patients, however, are seeing black Americans die from COVID-19 in alarmingly disproportionate numbers.

In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state population but represent 40% of the coronavirus deaths, according to state health officials.
Illinois's numbers are similar: of the state's 462 deaths, 262 of them were black patients, about 43% of the total fatalities. The state has about 1.8 million black residents, or about 14% of the population.
In North Carolina, where the population is 21% black, 38% of the state's COVID-19 deaths were black patients. 
About 28% of coronavirus fatalities in New York City, meanwhile, were black patients, and 34% were Hispanic, according to the New York State Department of Health.

So far, 12 people in St. Louis, Missouri, have died from COVID-19, all of whom were black, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Wednesday. 
ProPublica reported on April 3 that 81% of the deaths in Milwaukee County were black patients, despite the fact that only 26% of the county's population is black. 
Underlying conditions increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infections
The CDC report collected data about underlying health problems among 180 of the 1,482 hospitalized Americans in March. Of that subset, 89.3% had at least one underlying condition.
Andy Kiersz/Insider
The most commonly reported conditions were hypertension and obesity, followed by chronic lung disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, and heart disease.
According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, 32% of black Americas older than 18 had hypertension (high blood pressure), compared to 24% of whites in 2018. Non-Hispanic black Americans were 1.3 times more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic white people.
Black Americans were 20% more likely to die from heart disease than whites in 2017. In 2014, black people in the US were more than twice as likely to die due to asthma than white people, and four times more likely to be be admitted to the hospital for the condition. 
The new CDC data also reinforced other known trends about which age demographics are most at risk: Fatality rates for older people are far higher than for younger ones. People older than 65 had the highest rate of hospitalization per capita, the report showed — about 13.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 Americans.

The outbreak started in Wuhan, China, home to some of the country's top research laboratories. One of them — the Wuhan Institute of Virology — has done research on coronaviruses that originate in bats, as is the case with COVID-19.
The Chinese government denied that the lab was to blame early on, instead saying that the virus came from a wet market in the city. But there were holes in that theory. The market didn't sell bats and the first patient — as well as multiple people in the first cluster of cases — didn't have any connection to the market, as Yahoo News pointed out.
The sources who spoke out say the government is exploring the idea that a Wuhan lab accidentally released the virus into the public, perhaps through a worker who became unknowingly infected, and not intentionally. 
 China has blamed the outbreak on a wet market in Wuhan, pictured above on January 21, 2020.
Dake Kang/AP
Yahoo News reporter Jenna McLaughlin spoke to nine current and former intelligence and national security officials familiar with the ongoing investigations for her report.
She writes that one of the things that raised suspicions in the US intelligence community is the fact that China was so quick to peg the virus' source as the wet market. ""I find it very funny that China very quickly blamed the market,"" a retired intelligence official told Yahoo.
Sources told Fox that Chinese officials blamed the wet market to deflect attention from the laboratory and ""100 percent"" suppressed and changed data. ""Samples were destroyed, contaminated areas scrubbed, some early reports erased, and academic articles stifled,"" the report states.
The sources who spoke to CNN confirmed the initial reporting from Yahoo and Fox that the intelligence community is looking into the lab theory, but said it was only one of multiple possibilities that they are considering and that it's far from confirmed.
A previous story in The Washington Post appears to lend credibility to the lab theory. This week, the Post obtained US diplomatic cables from 2018, saying that lack of safety protocols at the Wuhan Institute of Virology could prompt an outbreak. Two diplomats who made multiple visits to the lab said they were concerned that sloppy safety standards for handling contagious viruses ""represented a risk for a new SARS-like pandemic."" (Samples of SARS were twice leaked accidentally from Chinese labs, according to Genome Biology, an academic journal.)
In recent weeks, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US has grown to eclipse those of China. With that has come criticism for President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis.
Trump has responded by pinning the blame on China, continually calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" and accusing the Chinese regime of lying about the scope of the outbreak there. 
 President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House on Wednesday, April 15, 2020.
Associated Press
Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both talked publicly about the potential lab theory in recent days.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, the president was asked about the recent reports and he said that the US is ""doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened."" However, he didn't discuss what he had been told in briefs about the possibility of the virus coming from a lab.
Following the press conference, Pompeo went into more detail about the theory on Fox News.
""What we do know is we know that this virus originated in Wuhan, China,"" Pompeo said. ""We know there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was. There is still lots to learn. The United States government is working diligently to figure it out.""

The social media giant announced the policy in a blog post on Thursday, following the World Health Organisation's characterization of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as a pandemic.
""Our top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic,"" read Twitter's statement.
""We understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times.""

 Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) March 12, 2020
The company described the move as moving beyond its initial recommendation of ""strongly encouraging"" employees to work from home following the coronavirus outbreak. Twitter currently has over 35 offices worldwide, and according to Statista, employs around 4,900 people.
According to Twitter's blog post, the company said it will continue to pay labor costs for standard working hours for contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their duties from home Twitter is not the only tech company to announce a policy like this. 
SEE ALSO: Here's what's happening to tech workers who can't work remotely as coronavirus spreads
The company also noted that it would be ""stepping in to ease additional expenses"" for parents who may need to pay for additional daycare if facilities close due to COVID-19. Twitter also said it would be giving reimbursement to employees toward setting up their home offices, which could include desks, chairs, and ergonomic chair cushions. Plus the company will bring back its in-house #FlockTalk employee support program which is ""activated when Tweeps want to come together during difficult times to share whats going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders.""
Twitter's move comes a day after Google asked tens of thousands of its workers in the U.S. and Canada to work from home for at least a month. Google also recommended that employees in Europe work from home.

According to a staff email sent on Monday and seen by The Telegraph, an employee and a medic at SpaceX's Hawthorne, California premises have the virus.
The employee had tested positive after returning from traveling abroad, and SpaceX claimed in its email that the risk of them having spread the virus to other employees was ""very low"" and ""no greater than going to the grocery store"" because the person had only been on-site for one day, last Monday.
The company asked anyone who'd come into contact with that employee that day to go home and self-isolate for 14 days, and added it was doing a ""video review"" of the employee's movements to see if anyone else might have come into contact with them.
The medic had ""close contact"" with 12 employees, all of whom have been sent home, the email said. SpaceX was not immediately available for comment on the report when contacted by Business Insider.
SpaceX has come under scrutiny for remaining open during California's ""shelter in place"" order, which bans non-essential businesses from staying open. 
CEO Elon Musk has also sent out mixed messages about the virus.
He has repeatedly claimed the coronavirus crisis has been overblown, saying towards the beginning of the global outbreak that the ""coronavirus panic is dumb.""
More recently Musk has started donating medical masks and ventilators to help fight the virus, and has promised that Tesla and SpaceX will manufacture ventilators, although he couched this by downplaying the severity of the outbreak, doubting whether hospitals will experience ventilator shortages.

From Hong Kong to Europe to Africa, street art about COVID-19 acts as public service announcements, solemn observations, and the occasional but crucial levity. Here's a glimpse of 12 pieces of coronavirus street art from around the world.

All the show’s staff and contestants are returning home, a CBS spokesperson tells TIME in an emailed statement.
“At this time, no racers or anyone on the production team traveling with them have contracted the virus, or shown symptoms, and we are not aware of anyone being exposed to it,” the spokesperson said. “Out of an abundance of caution, everyone involved in the show will continue to be monitored when they return home. The health and well-being of the racers and the production team are our top priorities.”
On The Amazing Race, contestants compete for $1 million through a series of physical and mental challenges, taking place in cities and locations around the world. Each episode usually sees the contestants traveling from one city — or country, or continent — to the next; each season’s “race” as a whole circumnavigates the globe.
Contestants on The Amazing Race 33 had so far only visited England and Scotland before production was suspended, CBS says. In the U.K., 20 people have tested positive for coronavirus — officially known as COVID-19 — as of Friday evening. No cases have been declared in Scotland.
The network and show producers have not yet determined a start date to resume filming. The teams — which are believed to include a pair of contestants from the CBS show Love Island, in a reality casting “crossover” — had completed three episodes before suspending production. CBS did not provide any information as to whether the season’s planned “route” would have led to countries grappling with more serious coronavirus outbreaks.
Several events throughout the world have been canceled amid coronavirus fear — from fashion weeks to tech conferences to religious pilgrimages. On Thursday, the K-Pop major boyband BTS announced the cancelation of planned concerts in South Korea where more than 2,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus and 13 people have died; speculation that the outbreak will impact this summer’s Olympics in Japan continues to swirl. Officials in Switzerland have altogether banned large events of 1,000 or more people.
Globally, at least 84,000 people have contracted the virus and nearly 3,000 have died.

Whatever spreads really quickly if you're dumb enough to ignore it,"" quipped Late Show host Stephen Colbert on Wednesday.
The majority of Americans are deeply dissatisfied with President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, considering it to have been far too slow. The U.S. currently has the largest number of infections in the world, with over 776,000 confirmed cases and 37,000 deaths.
Trump has been attempting to distract the public with various scapegoats, implementing a new ban on immigration despite the fact nobody can travel right now anyway. However, as Colbert points out, the president's usual messaging tactics aren't quite working. The only way he can fix this is if he actually fixes it.
""You can't have Bill Barr redact the virus, or call Ukraine to get dirt on Hunter Virus, or get Mitch McConnell to have 51 Republicans vote that there is no virus,"" said Colbert. ""You can't even pay the virus $130,000 to stay quiet, which is too bad because this virus is definitely spanking your ass."""

In March and April, the Seattle-based technology company fired two tech workers and three warehouse workers who had criticized Amazon over unsafe warehouse conditions during the current coronavirus pandemic. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AEJC), which started in Dec. 2018 to push for the development of a company-wide climate change plan, organized Friday's protest. Amazon also deleted an invitation to an AECJ livestream event in which warehouse workers were going to tell tech employees about their working conditions, which the group says is another impetus for Friday's protest. 
Friday's event, called Amazon Sick Out, also includes a daylong livestream, where the two fired warehouse workers spoke Friday morning. Climate justice activists and environmentalists such as Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein, youth and indigenous climate activists, and others also spoke. 
AECJ wants three things of Amazon:
<ol><li>Rehire the employees it fired who spoke out against warehouse conditions, and ensure such firings don't happen again
</li><li>Strengthen efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and make permanent temporary workplace improvements such as a living wage and paid sick leave 
</li><li>Commit to climate justice, investing first in communities of color who are impacted disproportionately by Amazon's pollution 
</li></ol>The reality is that Amazons distribution center model is not compatible with proper social distancing, a worker at an Amazon distribution center in Poland said in a press release emailed to Mashable. We are going to work knowing were taking a huge risk. There are 7,000 people where I work and theres no way for us to stay two meters apart.""
On March 31, the first Amazon warehouse worker died of coronavirus, per Business Insider. Though, it's not known if the employee caught the virus from an Amazon warehouse, according to the Hill. As of April 14, more than 70 Amazon facilities have had at least one employee test positive for COVID-19.
This isn't the first time Amazon workers have protested for safety conditions during the pandemic. Employees of Whole Foods (which Amazon owns)  organized a nationwide ""sick-out"" for Tuesday, March 31. They are planning another protest on May 1, according to the Guardian. 
An Amazon tech worker, who asked to remain anonymous because he was afraid he'd be fired for speaking out about poor conditions, called out sick on Friday to support warehouse workers.
""I don't want them to think of Seattle as this faceless corporate headquarters, I want them to know that there are tech workers here who have their backs and who want to push with them to get Amazon to treat them with the same dignity and respect for their health that they do with us,"" he said. ""Amazon makes it really difficult for us to connect with warehouse workers. I think this retaliation shows what would happen if tech workers start paying attention to their co-workers, without whom we would not have jobs.""
Amazon explains that only a handful of its more than 800,000 employees did not show up to work on Friday. ""Health and safety is our top priority and our focus remains on protecting associates in our operations network with extensive measures including distributing face masks, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer, implementing temperature checks, operating with strict social distancing protocols, and recognizing their contributions with additional pay and leading benefits,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an email.

But Maren Costa, one of the two fired tech workers, feels Amazon should do more. As she explains in the press release, Amazon thinks they can just fire any worker who speaks up for safety, but we want them to know that this is not OK."

As reported by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the ""Black Flag"" demonstrations were staged in response to the government's policies to quell the spread of COVID-19. These include civilian phone tracking, which protesters say is anti-democratic.
According to U.S. news site Axios, police marked places on the ground in Rabin Square so protesters knew where to stand at a safe distance to avoid the potential spread of the virus, and protesters were provided with masks by organisers.
Photos of the event are truly remarkable, a strange and undeniable sign of the times we're in.

This is a question posed on the #PolyProblems
 Tumblr page, one of several in a post titled ""Pandemic Poly Problems."" The post, dated March 30, muses about what a polyamorous person should do if they are staying at home with one partner but want to foster their other relationships. Can you have phone sex with one partner while another is in the room? What if the partners don't know each other well? 
For polyamorous people who have multiple partners whether with them or not social distancing adds another ripple into the fabric of these relationships. 
Different struggles for different dynamics
There are four types of dynamics going on right now according to relationship coach Effy Blue: People staying at home with partners but separated from other partners; people separated from all their partners, primary or otherwise; those polycules who decided to come together under one roof for social distancing; and solo polyamorous
 people living alone. 
Blue's coaching specializes in non-monogamy and polyamory. She's also the creator of Curious Fox, a community organization that aims to challenge the status quo in terms of love, sex, and relationships. ""Everyone's having their own challenges,"" said Blue. Among her clients and the broader community, Blue has noticed a kind of mourning (which is not unique
 to those who are polyamorous).
She guessed that solo polyamorous people are struggling the most, especially if they have partners who are with their families or other partners themselves. ""There's an exacerbated sense of loneliness,"" Blue said. 
""There's an exacerbated sense of loneliness.""
Ashley Ray, a comedian in Los Angeles, is solo polyamorous, and has been since 2013. ""Even, for me, given that background, I've really been struggling,"" she said. ""If you're like me, you're going insane and you're just trying to video chat everyone you can.""
Not only is Ray living alone, but she's speaking to partners who are far from alone. ""I did have one partner who very much wanted to detail the fun crazy quarantined sex he and his partner are having,"" she said, ""and I was just like, 'Come on, you gotta shut up.'""
""I am literally in a place where I can talk to my partners all I want but I can't go see them,"" Ray continued, ""and it's even more unclear for people who are solo poly, really when can I see my partners again?"" 
That doesn't mean, however, that people who are coupled at home aren't having their own unique troubles. For those who are staying at home with one partner (their immediate partner, as Blue referenced) and away from other partners (their auxiliary partners), there's the balance of maintaining those relationships while adhering to the needs of the person you're living with. People focusing all their attention on their auxiliary partners because they can't be with them, for example, could cause tension with their immediate partner.

Ray said she's dealing with this from the other side of establishing boundaries with partners who are with their respective partners. She used an example of how designated days to see a partner don't work under these circumstances. ""In a quarantine, you know we're not just gonna see each other on Thursday,"" she said, ""We can literally FaceTime each other every single day if we want to and text all the time.""
But that increased time spent with Ray can impact that person's other partners, so she's had to reconsider boundaries and take others' needs into consideration. 
Steve Dean, online dating consultant at Dateworking.com
, a dating coaching and consulting business, told Mashable that he's staying at home with one partner and communicating with others virtually. He and his in-person partner lived in separate apartments before New York's stay-at-home statutes were put in place, but he relocated so they could be together. 
In some cases, Dean said, social distancing has brought him closer with other partners, even those who even in normal circumstances live in different countries. ""I'm still staying in touch and in some ways in closer touch with my other partners,"" he said. ""If anything, now that I have fewer things going on, every night I have more time that I can set aside for intentional heart-to-hearts and virtual chats with partners who are abroad."" 
SEE ALSO: Don't despair about being single while social distancing. Here's why.
Whereas for Ray, the emotional labor of being polyamorous during the pandemic had to do with considering other people's boundaries, Dean's has to do with shifting displays of affection. Our current moment has led to uncharted emotional territory, according to Dean, as he and his partners had had to rely on words of affirmation over other love languages like touch. 
He's also noticed higher-quality nudes. ""Now that you're cooped up at home, you can have time to set up some good lighting and think of various ways of portraying yourself in that light,"" said Dean. 
Polycules
 living in one home, too, can have their own issues. They may be dealing with dynamics they never had to before and different distributions of labor. Since they cannot go to someone else's house, they all have to learn how to run a household together, according to Blue. 
""There's a lot of work to be done there,"" said Blue, though she noted she's mostly seen positive impacts from a polycule being in one place. If relationship issues had previously gone unavoided, they're bubbling up to the surface now. ""People feel like they have time to talk about things without feeling like it has to be solved then and there,"" she said, ""Because there's a sense that we're all going to be here for awhile."" 
How to cope with social distanced-polyamory
Blue had tips for polyamorous people in these varying situations. Beyond connecting with the polyamorous community, friends, and family, solo polyamorous people could also use weighted blankets or self-massage if they're missing the physicality of being with others. 
One consideration Blue gave in terms of talking to partners is adding cadence, or variety, to both their days and conversations. Since people are having monotonous days, partners both near and far may be having monotonous conversations all about the coronavirus, current events, and the like over and over. ""The human brain likes variety,"" said Blue, ""Especially poly folk like variety that's why they tend to choose [the lifestyle] they've chosen.""
If partners are together, Blue recommended setting aside time to be present with them. This includes activities like a game or ""sexy time"" which doesn't have to be just sex, but learning about each others' preferences. ""Can you gamify your experience a little bit? Bring some joy and humor into it,"" Blue said.
Image: vicky leta / mashable
""If you're in quarantine with a partner, sex is a great hobby,"" she added.  
In normal circumstances, Curious Fox provides year-round programming anything from panels to workshops to socials but they have since moved their programming online. They've adapted to a space they call their ""virtual curiosity salon,"" bringing expert speakers to discuss various topics in the realm of relationships. Similar to dating event company Here/Now
, Curious Fox also hosts virtual socials where participants can get to know each other.  
Dean, who himself was a guest for one of Curious Fox's virtual salons, also mentioned the boom in video calls. He called the live video chatting app Houseparty
 a godsend. 
Ray also has been figuring out different ways to connect with partners, say exchanging emails or starting a meme group as opposed to having a movie night or date day. ""It's been finding new ways to interact, which is kind of fun,"" she said, ""and I guess a new way to do polyamory for me.""
Post-COVID polyamory
As with any other relationship, people may wonder how their polycule or the overarching polyamorous community will change in a post-coronavirus world. In terms of the community, Blue herself would like to continue virtual Curious Fox events as she's able to get speakers who are not in the New York area.
""This current situation is going to cause a leap in adopting technology,"" Blue predicted. ""People who otherwise wouldn't even dream of sitting in Zoom meetings are now sitting in Zoom meetings."" Virtual mixers that are a necessity now may become a luxury in the future, an alternative to a Netflix night.

Beyond larger shifts, individual relationships may change too. How it plays out will vary from person to person, but Blue believes that longtime, established polyamorous relationships will fare just fine. She compared them to lava lamps: frequently morphing and changing within an established framework. 
She also predicted more monogamous couples will open up their relationships post-social distancing. ""I can also imagine relationships opening up because having spent so much concentrated time together,"" she said, ""I can see people that are coming out of that going, 'I love you and I just need other things.'""
Blue went on to say that people who may be single may be sick of it once this social distancing period is over. ""I definitely think that the gleam of the single life especially in urban areas, New Yorkers love to be single is definitely fading fast,"" she said. 
""The nature of how we relate to one another has entirely changed even just in the past month.""
While Blue predicted that this will cause singles to couple up, Ray is firm that she will stay solo polyamorous. While she misses her partners, she still enjoys being on her own. ""I'm solo poly because I really value my autonomy and independence,"" she said. 
In addition to relationship dynamics, the ways that partners communicate and connect may also change when social distancing is over. Ray said that the pandemic has forced important conversations to happen a lot sooner than they would previously, such as what polyamory means to them or what rules or boundaries a potential partner may have.
""The nature of how we relate to one another has entirely changed even just in the past month,"" Dean said. ""Holding space for one another has skyrocketed in terms of how much we prioritize it."" People have been showing up and listening more intently, according to Dean; it's pretty easy for one to see you're not paying attention during a Zoom call.
For Ray, this experience proves that polyamory is about the love of drama, intense discussions, and emotional intimacy. ""A lot of people think polyamory is just about the sex,"" Ray said. ""And it can't be about the sex now right now."""

Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.
Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.
Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say. 
""If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department,"" said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.
""If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911,"" Harris added.
The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a ""persistent pain or pressure in the chest,"" and ""bluish lips or face,"" which can indicate a lack of oxygen.
Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.
Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people. 
""I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm,"" Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.
Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).
""There are many misconceptions about fever,"" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
""We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree,"" Williams said, adding that for most people ""99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."" 
Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.
""Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal,"" Schaffner explained.
""One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever.""
Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.
""It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated,"" Schaffner explained.
The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.
""It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated,"" Schaffner added.
A report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs. 
""The beast comes out at night,"" said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1. 
'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors,"" he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.
""I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky,"" Cuomo said. 
Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.
One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.
Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.
At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed. 
""In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients,"" Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.
Overall, ""I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have,"" Gupta said.
The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.
Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. 
Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.
But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.
Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.
8. Loss of smell and taste
In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.
""What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.
""It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones.""
""Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms,""according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.
It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to ENT UK (PDF), a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom.
Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the ""jellybean test"" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.
For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.
Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings. 
""I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by,"" Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. ""I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours.""
Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.
10. Headache, sore throat, congestion
The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion. 
Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.
Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too. 
""At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them"" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.
That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.
It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.
In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.
""Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,"" the CDC advises.
To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.
""People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age,"" Schaffner said.
A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.
If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.
""We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue,"" Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. ""However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated.""
If you do have those three signs, where should you go?
""If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients,"" Harris said.
""If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers,"" Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.
""If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly,"" Schaffer said. ""It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do.""

""I see the disinfectant where it knocks [the coronavirus] out in a minute, one minute,"" said Trump during the White Houses daily coronavirus briefing. ""And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.

 Daniel Lewis (@Daniel_Lewis3) April 24, 2020
It should go without saying that this idea is dangerously, mind-bogglingly wrong, but apparently these truths are no longer self-evident in 2020. So I will reiterate in the strongest of terms: do not, under any circumstances, inject, drink, or otherwise introduce bleach or any other disinfectant into your body. The corrosive substance will burn your insides, may permanently damage your organs, and could even kill you.
 It will also be incredibly painful the entire time you are dying.
The whole endeavour is like trying to get rid of a spider on your jacket by setting yourself on fire. 
Trumps comments have been roundly denounced by medical experts
 as well as thousands of people online. Fortunately, it seems many were already aware that chugging a jug of Clorox is an astronomically terrible idea. Twitter users instantly reacted to the presidents highly uneducated and unqualified medical advice with widespread derision.
Not in my wildest, darkest imagination could I have ever imagined, in fact or fiction, a president suggesting injecting disinfectants, household cleaning products, as a pandemic curative.

 Stay-at-Home Panicked Pixie Dream Girl (@paintedbird) April 24, 2020
Though Trump's suggestion of injecting bleach has gotten the most attention, his idea of using ultraviolet light is also extremely hazardous. There has been some research into the effect of ultraviolet light on the coronavirus when it is in the air or on surfaces, but using it to cure an infected person is a completely different, not at all analogous matter.
Depending on how powerful the light is and how long you're exposed to it, such treatment could burn you, cause cancer, or do absolutely nothing. It will not, however, cure you of COVID-19.
You really have to be on your toes. I missed the stuff about the bleach treatment because I was busy asking people if Id heard the president correctly about the heat treatment.

 Donald J. Trump          (@realDonaldTrFan) April 23, 2020
Though the dangers of ingesting bleach may be obvious to many, Trump's careless speculation about potential coronavirus cures has previously had tragic consequences. In March an Arizona man died after drinking aquarium cleaner chloroquine phosphate, prompted by Trump's false claims that related compound hydroxychloroquine was a cure.
Please. For your own sake. Don't take medical advice from Donald Trump."

Beyoncé herself made a PSA of her own on Saturday. She made a surprise cameo on the ""One World: Together At Home"" concert. While Beyoncé didn't perform, she did thank healthcare workers, people in the food industry, delivery workers and others on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. Beyoncé also made sure to point out that people of color are suffering disproportionately during the pandemic. 
""Black Americans disproportionately belong to these essential parts of the workforce that do not have the luxury of working from home,"" Beyoncé noted. ""And African American communities at large have been severely affected in this crisis. Those with pre-existing conditions are at an even higher risk.

Now, a new report by the New York Times claims Chinese operatives may have helped proliferate those messages, using new, ""alarming"" techniques. 
Citing six unnamed American officials working in six different agencies, the report claims that Chinese agents helped push the messages across platforms. What makes this particularly troublesome is the fact that these messages showed up on people's phones as texts, which is a disinformation tactic that some of the New York Times' sources haven't encountered before. 
In one example, a text message urged people to ""stock up"" with a ""two week supply of everything,"" claiming that the President will order a two week nation-wide quarantine ""within 48 to 72 hours."" The message urged the recipients to forward the info to their contacts. 
The fake info was also spread through Facebook and encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp, with the latter being especially problematic as it made it harder for law enforcement to track. 
It's unclear where and how the messages originated. Some of the officials said the Chinese agents likely did not create the messages, but rather amplified existing messages. After a critical mass mass was reached, the messages continued to spread on their own. This tactic is similar to the Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential election. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry told the New York Times that the allegations are ""complete nonsense"" and ""not worth refuting.""
SEE ALSO: Self-driving vans are delivering food and disinfecting streets in China
The goal behind such a disinformation campaign, according to the New York Times' report, is creating political division within the American public, and is a part of an ongoing information war between China and the United States. 
The report claims that other rival powers besides China may have been involved in the dissemination of the messages, but offers no further details. On Tuesday, Politico cited an unpublished State Department report that warned of a disinformation ""onslaught"" launched against the U.S. by China, Iran and Russia."

But I managed to attend the event without signing into Zoom, a feat I'm trying to keep up as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. 
I downloaded Zoom both on my computer and phone in 2018, way before COVID-19 existed. It's been a common video chat app for many companies and businesses for years since it was first released in 2013. There were 10 million Zoom users at the end of 2019 before the concept of social distancing was commonplace and 300 million users eventually jumped onto the Zoom train.
On my phone, Zoom gives three options on the opening screen: ""Join a Meeting,"" ""Sign Up,"" or ""Sign In."" On desktop, it's similar: ""Join a Meeting,"" ""Host a Meeting,"" ""Sign In,"" or (highlighted in a bright orange box), ""Sign Up, It's Free."" I've only ever joined a meeting, which is fine by me. There isn't much allure for a free sign-up since the service works exactly the same without doing so. 
The company would like you signed up and locked in with your personal information and access to your usage data and more. Digging through Zoom's terms, you can pinpoint the type of personal data it asks from customers (with the disclaimer that it's not limited to the posted list). 
In its privacy policy, the list of data Zoom collects from you includes information about your devices, internet connection, phone number if you're calling in, your location based on the nearest city and data center, how you use Zoom, and metadata about your usage. For example, Zoom will notice if you switch from using the mobile app to the desktop version. 
But I have maintained my Zoom anonymity by either clicking links sent over from other Zoom meeting hosts or joining a meeting with a meeting ID number and password. For my synagogue's weekend Zoom event, I had saved the invite on my calendar along with the nine-digit ID number and password. I and copy-and-pasted those in as prompted and entered the meeting without issue. No one knows you're Zooming without official credentials.
My Zoom app experience.
Image: zoom / screenshot 
Even if Zoom has taken over during social distancing (it's the most popular video chat app right now based on downloads and users), I'm determined to continue using the service without creating an account. I might be perceived as a mooch, taking advantage of others sacrificing their personal information to set up accounts and inviting me to their hosted meetings. But it's worth it to me.
An even more extreme stance: Don't download the app. Most Zoom meetings have call-in numbers that you can dial into from your phone to join through your phone's audio.

""Mayor Goodman has a lot of thoughts, and the one thing those thoughts have in common is that none of them make any sense,"" said late show host Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday.
Speaking to Anderson Cooper in a frankly baffling CNN interview, Goodman stood strong in her dangerous resolve to completely ignore expert medical advice. The mayor even went so far as to offer up Las Vegas' citizens as a ""control group,"" as though her 644,000 constituents were nothing more than lab rats. 
Fortunately the offer was nixed, though Goodman offered some incredibly flawed framing of the matter when questioned.
""She isn't offering Las Vegans as a control group. She offered them as a control group and they told her she can't,"" said Kimmel, succinctly summarising Goodman's stance. ""It's totally different.""

It's a notable uptake considering some Australians had expressed concerns about privacy issues.
Released on Sunday, COVIDSafe uses Bluetooth to connect with other phones within 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) which also have the app installed. If they are in contact for over 15 minutes, the app records data such as the date, time, contact distance and duration, and the other user's encrypted identification code. This information is stored on the user's phone for 21 days, after which it is automatically deleted.
Therefore, if someone using COVIDSafe is diagnosed with COVID-19, health officials can use the patient's app data to quickly notify people they've been in contact with. The hope is that this will help contain outbreaks and slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Australian states and territories are currently in various levels of shutdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, having reported over 6,703 confirmed cases and 81 deaths. Fortunately, the country's efforts to flatten the curve appear to be having some success. Only 117 new cases were reported last week, compared to 297 cases the week before.
As at 10:30 PM 1 million Australians have now downloaded and registered for the #CovidSafeapp - please join us and help protect ourselves, our families, each other but above all else our nurses and doctors
 Greg Hunt (@GregHuntMP) April 26, 2020
COVIDSafe sounds like a helpful app overall, but many Australians are naturally and justifiably suspicious about the entire concept of a government tracking app. 
In response, the Australian government has assured the public that the app does not gather location data, and only requires users to supply their name, age range, phone number, and postcode. Users also have the option to use a pseudonym rather than their legal name. Data is kept on users' phones, and will only be uploaded to a server if they give consent.
""In terms of privacy, no person can access whats on their phone, no other person can access whats on your phone,"" said Australian Minister for Health Greg Hunt on Sunday.
 
""Its up to you whether you then release the information on your app, in which case its encoded, and encrypted, and sent to the national data store which is a server here in Australia.""
Further, uploaded data must legally be kept on Australian servers, and will be destroyed after the coronavirus pandemic passes.
""[The data] cannot leave the country, it cannot be accessed by anybody other than a state public health official, it cannot be used for any purpose other than the provision of data for the purposes of finding people with whom you have been in close contact, and it is punishable by jail if there is a breach of that,"" said Hunt.
SEE ALSO: Google and Apple team up to support coronavirus contact tracing
Australian developers have already gotten to work decompiling the app and have found it to be as secure as advertised, though they continue to dig into it. 
""From what I can see, everything in the #covidsafe app is above board, very transparent and follows industry standard,"" tweeted Australian mobile developer Matthew Robbins. 
Hunt stated in a Monday interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the app's source code will be released within two weeks, again emphasising the importance of security and privacy. 
Aside from the app itself, some Australians have also raised concerns regarding COVIDSafe's servers. Though operating out of the Australian capital of Canberra, the servers are run by American corporation Amazon. This has given rise to fears U.S. law may apply to these servers, which could give U.S. law enforcement access to the data.
However, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Government Services Minister Stuart Robert have both dismissed these concerns.
""This is exactly the same way the Australian Government already uses [Amazon Web Services] for many other agencies, including the work of our intelligence agencies, including [Australian Signals Directorate], and ensures Australian data stays in Australia,"" said a spokesman for Robert.
SEE ALSO: Bing made the best coronavirus tracker. Seriously.
Australia isn't the first country to use phone tracking to help manage the coronavirus. The COVIDSafe app drew on Singapore's TraceTogether app, which has been downloaded by approximately one in five people in the country since its March launch. 
As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, countries around the world are increasingly turning to technology for solutions. Google and Apple even announced a joint effort to assist governments in tracking people exposed to infected individuals.
This rapid and widespread adoption makes it all the more important for people to scrutinise potential privacy issues. Fortunately, Australia's COVIDSafe app initially appears as innocuous as a government tracking app can be."

Sweden has yet to order any lockdowns amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to AFP. The country has left schools, restaurants, and gyms open, and while the government banned gatherings over 50 people and urged residents to self-isolate, life appears to be mostly unchanged.
Sweden's lack of strict lockdowns is in contrast to the rest of Europe, and it has yet to see a downturn in COVID-19 cases. The country, which has a population of 10.23 million, has seen 14,777 cases so far, and 1,580 deaths from the virus.
Sweden's Nordic neighbors, Norway and Finland, approached the virus differently, and it could be why they're facing just a fraction of COVID-19-related deaths
Norway went into lockdown in mid-March, closing schools, restaurants, cultural events, gyms, and tourist attractions. It also banned outside travelers. Finland, which has been stockpiling medical supplies since the Cold War, restricted border traffic, banned gatherings of 10 or more people, and closed schools as part of its coronavirus guidelines.
Norway, which has only 5.368 million people, has seen 7,127 cases, and just 181 deaths. Finland, with a population of  5.5 million, has seen 3,868 COVID-19 cases and 94 deaths.
Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist who created Sweden's relaxed coronavirus response plan, told local media that the country's fatality rates show the spread of the virus is starting to ""plateau,"" according to Bloomberg.
Charts released by Pantheon Macroeconomics, however, contradict Tegnell. Sweden's COVID-19 cases appear to still be rising, and Norway's appear to already be on a downslide. 
This side-by-side of Sweden v Norway shows that Sweden may have made a mistake in taking a relaxed approach to lockdown.
Ian Shepherdson / Pantheon Macroeconomics
Bo Lundback, professor of epidemiology at the University of Gothenburg, told Agence Frances-Press that a change needs to happen.
""The authorities and the government stupidly did not believe that the epidemic would reach Sweden at all,"" he said.
About 2,300 academics signed an open letter last month calling for Sweden to reconsider its approach to the virus, according to Fox News.
Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler, a professor at the Karolinska Institute who signed the letter, told Fox News: ""We must establish control over the situation, we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos. No one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?""
Swedes, so far, have been refraining from travel, according to Bloomberg, and Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in an interview with Radio Sweden that its rules ""affect the whole society,"" according to Bloomberg.

While Sweden has had more COVID-19 deaths than Finland and Norway, HSBC Global Research economist James Pomeroy told Bloomberg that Sweden's COVID-19 strategy might help its economy bounce back more quickly than it will in other countries because businesses were able to remain open. 
""While Sweden's unwillingness to lock down the country could ultimately prove to be ill-judged, for now, if the infection curve flattens out soon, the economy could be better placed to rebound,"" he said.

In a draft legal text published earlier this week, the government warned there could be a run on nicotine replacements thanks to the study. Pharmacies dispensing treatments for tobacco addiction must limit the amount they issue to an individual patient to a single month's supply.
The text states: ""Because of media coverage around the possible protective action of nicotine against Covid-19, there is a strong risk that the dispensing in pharmacies and internet sales of nicotine replacements will experience a surge in the coming days.""
The government said the ban would stop people from rushing out and potentially over-consuming nicotine substitutes, as well as ensure a steady supply for patients genuinely being treated for smoking addiction.
The decree comes after a Paris hospital study found that the infection rate for smokers among COVID-19 patients was lower than non-smokers. The study factored in around 480 patients at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital. French researchers now plan to hand out nicotine patches to COVID-19 patients and frontline health workers to explore the theory further.
According to Jean-Pierre Changeux from France's Pasteur Institut, a co-author of the study, the theory is that nicotine may adhere to cell receptors, thus blocking the virus from entering people's cells.
Still, the researchers warned of the dangers of nicotine in their study, and that smoking remains extremely dangerous for your health.
And overall, the research on smoking and nicotine's impacts on COVID-19 patients is nascent. Scientific American notes there's a considerable body of research to show that smoking reduces lung function and increases flu risk. And a study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested Chinese smokers who contracted COVID-19 were more likely to get severe infections. An overview of the current studies on the link between COVID-19 and smoking suggested that COVID-19 patients who smoked were more likely to be admitted to intensive care.

A person — described by CNN as an ""older woman"" — reportedly contracted the virus without having recently traveled overseas or knowingly coming in contact with any person who had contracted the coronavirus. The other California case isa woman from Solano County currently hospitalized at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the report said.
""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission, but the extent is still not clear,"" Sara Cody, director of the Santa Clara County public health department, said, according to CNN. 
Health officials said the Santa Clara woman had not traveled to Solano County, raising more questions about how the woman contracted the virus, believed to have originated last year at a market in Wuhan, China, a city in the country's Hubei province.
The Washington state case involves a boy at Jackson High School in Snohomish County. The school will be closed on Monday as it undergoes deep cleaning following the student's diagnosis.
As Daily Mail reported, while the latest case marks only the fourth known instance of ""community spread"" in the US, it is the third instance within the past 24 hours. 
Officials for the Centers for Disease Control said it hoped to have every state nationwide testing for the virus by the end of next week as the US ramps up its plan to combat the virus, CNN said, which has so far been primarily in China but has begun to spread across Asian and to parts of Europe. 
As Business Insider previously reported, there the CDC has confirmed dozens of cases in states across the country in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
""Community spread means spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown,"" a CDC press releasefrom Wednesday said.
In other words, a case can be described as a ""community spread"" when an infected person has had no history of traveling to China where the virus broke out, meaning the virus was likely contracted from another person in the individual's same community.

A CDC official said the new approach addresses a testing kit issue and will significantly expand testing as health agencies prepare for more U.S. cases, including possible spread of the virus not just limited to travelers returning from endemic regions.
Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency has taken steps to address problems with test kits mailed to state and local labs.
""This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked,"" Messonnier said. 
More:Coronavirus, explained: Everything to know about COVID-19, the deadly virus alarming the world
The CDC initially developed and mailed testing kits with three components, or reagents, to detect the new virus, COVID-19. Some states had trouble validating one of three components in the kits. The CDC reviewed the glitch and concluded using two components are ""appropriately sensitive and specific"" to accurately detect coronavirus, Messonnier said.
The CDC will begin making kits with two components and share those kits with states, local health departments and other qualified labs. Public health labs that still have the three-component tests on hand can begin using the two-component testing method to produce accurate results.
""Our goal is to have every state and local health department online, doing their own testing by the end of next week,"" Messonnier said Friday.
On Thursday, the CDC also expanded testing criteria of ""patients under investigation"" to reflect the wider spread of the virus around the globe. People with a fever, cough or shortness of breath who traveled to five nations where the virus is spreading rapidly China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea are recommended for testing.
Two weeks ago, the CDC announced it would begin testing people with flu-like symptoms in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle to detect possible spread of coronavirus. That testing should begin next week with plans to expand surveillance to all 50 states, Messonnier said.
Earlier this week, CDC warned of ""severe"" disruptions to everyday life with more coronavirus cases in U.S. communities, not just among travelers returning from affected regions. Possible disruptions could be school closings, canceled or postponed public gatherings and businesses forced to have employees work remotely. 
Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed frustration about the CDC's testing criteria and the limited number of test kits available. He said the number of testing kits was ""simply inadequate"" to adequately identify new cases.
His comments came after the CDC and California health officials announced the nation's first possible case of ""community spread,"" or an unknown source of infection.
The woman was transferred to University of California, Davis Medical Center from another Northern California hospital on Feb. 19 but was not tested for the virus until four days later. Dr. David Lubarsky, CEO of the medical center, wrote in a memo that hospital staff asked public health officials whether the patient should be tested when she arrived at the hospital.
""Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered,"" Lubarsky wrote.
Messonnier defended the CDC's handling of the case, noting the agency did not learn about the patient's circumstances until Feb. 23 and immediately ordered testing. The CDC received the patient's specimens on Feb. 25 and confirmed the next day she had the virus. 
Messonnier said the CDC has dispatched a team to jointly investigate the case with the California Department of Public Health to trace all of the woman's contacts.
""People who were exposed to this person during their infection are at some level or risk, depending on their exposure,"" Messonnier said, citing family members and health care workers who had close, sustained contact as likely candidates for monitoring.
A second case was confirmed Friday by officials in San Jose, California."

""We are aware of these reports of individuals who have tested negative for COVID-19 using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing and then after some days testing positive again,"" a WHO spokesperson told Reuters.
On Friday, South Korea reported that 91 coronavirus patients they believed to have recovered from the disease tested positive for the virus again.
Guidelines from WHO on clinical management recommended that a clinically recovered COVID-19 patient should test negative for the virus twice, with tests conducted at least 24 hours apart, before being discharged from the hospital.  
 The COVID-19 patients in South Korea were being considered for discharge after testing negative for the disease — however, tests administered later showed positive results.
South Korean health officials said they would be launching epidemiological investigations to determine what was behind the trend.
Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a news briefing that the virus may have ""reactivated"" in the patients, as opposed to the patients being re-infected again, Bloomberg reported. 
""While we are putting more weight on reactivation as the possible cause, we are conducting a comprehensive study on this,"" Jeong said Monday. ""There have been many cases when a patient during treatment will test negative one day and positive another.""
The number of patients who were believed to have been cleared of the coronavirus but later tested positive jumped from 51 on Monday to 91 on Friday. Shortly after, WHO announced it would also be looking into the recent COVID-19 trend in South Korea as well. 
""We are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases. It is important to make sure that when samples are collected for testing on suspected patients, procedures are followed properly,"" a spokesperson for WHO told Reuters in a statement.
According to WHO, current studies show that patients with mild COVID-19 experience a period of about two weeks between the onset of symptoms and clinical recovery. But it remains unclear why these patients are testing positive after they were believed to have recovered from COVID-19.
""As COVID-19 is a new disease, we need more epidemiological data to draw any conclusions,"" the statement added. 
More than 390,000 people worldwide have recovered from the coronavirus, according to data collected by John Hopkins. 
Infectious disease experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, believe that ""people who recover [from COVID-19] are really protected against re-infection.""
People who have been infected develop antibodies that can ""probably fight off the coronavirus if they encounter it again,"" making them temporarily immune to the coronavirus, according to Business Insider's Morgan McFall-Johnsen. However, it's unclear how long the protection lasts, she added. 
Recently, Dr. Anthony Fauci said people who recover from the coronavirus will likely be immune should a second wave of infection spread in the early fall. But preliminary studies about coronavirus immunity show that not all recovered patients develop the antibodies needed to protect ourselves from the virus.

The study was conducted by the Center for Health Operations and Intelligence, which is comprised of a group of Brazilian universities and institutes, according to Reuters. According to the study, just 8% of cases of the novel coronavirus in the country are being reported by the government.
The Center for Health Operations and Intelligence had so far had an accurate record of predicting the virus in Brazil, Reuters said.
The number was determined when researchers compared the ratio of the nation's reported COVID-19 cases that have resulted in deaths through April 10 with the expected death rate from the World Health Organization, the report said.
There are at least 23,955 cases of COVID-19 and 1,361 resulting deaths, according to official data from Brazil's health ministry and analyzed by Johns Hopkins University. If the number of cases is 12 times higher, there would be more than 280,000 cases in the nation.
The study found the government was testing and reporting only the most serious cases of COVID-19. The organization pointed to issues with testing in the country as part of the reason for the described underreporting, according to the report. 
Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil's minister of health, has acknowledged the country has had issues distributing tests, which he attributed to the size of the country. He agreed that testing in the country needed to improve, Reuters said. 
According to the study, the number of hospitalizations for severe respiratory symptoms has been more than three times higher than typical for this time of year. Just 12% of those hospitalizations have been linked to COVID-19.
As of April 9, Brazil had around 127,000 suspected — not confirmed – COVID-19 cases and had administered less than 63,000 tests, according to official figures. More than 93,000 tests were still being processed for results as of Monday, according to the report.
According to Reuters, there have been divisions between President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed risks of COVID-19, and the health minister and state and local leaders, who have called for stricter measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Brazil's president had in March said — without evidence — that Brazilians may have a natural immunity to the coronavirus.

The diagnostic sampling kits were flown by helicopter to the cruise ship Grand Princess, which California Governor Gavin Newsom has said would be kept offshore until passengers and crew who have fallen ill can be tested for possible coronavirus infection. 
The delivery operation was organized by the U.S. Coast Guard, according to Scott Pauley, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is also helping coordinate the effort. 
He said a helicopter carried a batch of test kits to the ship, and a photograph taken from the ship by a passenger and sent to Reuters showed a military chopper descending near the vessel. 
The Grand Princess had been due to return to San Francisco on Wednesday night from a 15-day voyage to and from Hawaii, with 2,383 passengers and 1,100 crew, Mary Ellen Caroll, executive director of the city’s Department of Emergency Management, told a news conference on Thursday. 
But Newsom acted to keep the vessel from port after learning some people on board - 35 according to Carroll - had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, a respiratory illness that has infected more than 95,000 people worldwide, most of them in China, where the virus originated. 
Two passengers who traveled on the same ship on a voyage last month between San Francisco and Mexico later fell ill and tested positive for the coronavirus. Health officials say they probably contracted the illness aboard the vessel. 
One, an elderly man from Placer County near Sacramento with underlying health conditions, died this week, the first documented coronavirus fatality in California. The other, from the Bay area, was described by Newsom as gravely sick. 
The Princess cruise line, a unit of Carnival Corp, the world’s largest cruise operator, said fewer than 100 passengers and crew from the Hawaii voyage have been identified for testing, including those who were ill. 
Tests will also be given to dozens of “holdover” passengers from the Mexico trip who stayed on the ship for the voyage to Hawaii, and “guests currently under care for respiratory illness,” the cruise line said in a statement. 
Pauley said the company was believed to be following CDC guidance to quarantine symptomatic individuals until test results are returned, a process that Carroll said was expected to take about 24 hours. 
Newsom said state health authorities, working with the CDC and local health authorities were trying to contact some 2,500 passengers who were on the earlier cruise to Mexico. 
It was not immediately clear what would occur should anyone now aboard the ship test positive. 
“Once we have results from the tests, the CDC and the state will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth, and the location needs to provide for the safety of the surrounding community as well as the passengers and crew,” Carroll told reporters. 
She said the ship might be directed to an arrival point other than San Francisco. 
The governor on Wednesday declared a statewide emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
California health authorities have confirmed 59 cases, second only to Washington state, where authorities have documented 70. 
The predicament of the Grand Princess was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess cruise liner that was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China. 
Some U.S. passengers from that ship were ultimately repatriated to military bases in California for extended quarantines.

BayGn.DE 
In an exchange of enthusiastic emails among federal health officials reviewed by Reuters, Keagan Lenihan, chief of staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cautioned that “3-4 days” of testing would be needed. 
“Potentially serious issues with product so let’s be careful when we take that win,” she wrote. 
Bayer has since donated three million tablets of the drug, called Resochin, to the U.S. national stockpile for treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. After a brief period of testing, its use in the United States was approved on an emergency basis. 
But three U.S. government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that there is reason to be concerned about the quality of Resochin and its makers, located in India and Pakistan. 
Although some rules can be waived in an emergency, the FDA dropped its quality-control standards too far as it scoured the world for scarce supplies of chloroquine drugs, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The plants that make Resochin ingredients and finished doses in India and Pakistan have never been registered with, or inspected by, the FDA, according to the three government sources, as well as FDA documents compiled in the private online database FDAzilla.com. Some chloroquine drugs were already approved by the FDA before the pandemic as antimalarial medications, a process that required plant inspections. Resochin was not approved. 
Pakistani regulators, who inspected Bayer’s Resochin plant in Karachi in 2015, found a “gross failure” in manufacturing processes there, according to documents from the Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, reviewed by Reuters. And though the FDA has never screened the Indore, India, plant that supplies ingredients for Resochin, the U.S. agency has inspected other Indian plants run by the same Indian supplier and found serious deficiencies, including falsification of records, inspection documents spanning 2014 through 2019 show. 
Responding to questions from Reuters about Resochin, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said that the agency “sampled and tested the donated drugs to evaluate acceptability for importation” and they met appropriate standards. 
Asked about Lenihan’s March 21 email, the FDA spokesman said the agency “does not comment on alleged, leaked emails.” 
In a statement to Reuters, Bayer said that the FDA had tested Resochin “and found it to be of appropriate quality for release to the (stockpile) for emergency use. We are proud to make this donation to the U.S. government in the fight against COVID-19.” 
Resochin is part of a class of medications containing one of two active ingredients - chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine - that the Trump administration has praised as a potentially lifesaving treatment. But the effectiveness of chloroquine drugs against coronavirus has not been proven. Though in use for years in the United States as a treatment for malaria and autoimmune conditions such as lupus, the medicines can have serious side effects, including heart arrhythmias. 
The three U.S. sources who spoke with Reuters, as well as an independent expert, said spot-testing is not always sufficient to ensure a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and plant inspections normally done by the FDA are crucial to ensuring overall quality. 
“If you’re talking about millions of doses, you can’t test every product,” said Stephen Payne, who for years chaired a practice group specializing in the FDA and health care at a global law firm. “You have no idea what you don’t know.” 
A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY 
Trump first endorsed chloroquine drugs to treat COVID-19 from the White House podium on March 19, citing “very, very encouraging early results” and downplaying any risks. “If things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anyone,” he said. 
The statements came as the administration was being hammered for its slow response to the growing coronavirus crisis, which to date has infected more than 637,000 people in the United States, killing almost 31,000. His comments set high public expectations for the drugs, which are now being snapped up all over the globe. 
In emails two days later, federal health officials greeted the Bayer donation of chloroquine phosphate, or Resochin, with eagerness. 
Cicely Waters, director of external affairs for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), saw a media opportunity. A shipment of two million tablets was due to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. 
“I would like to get photos of the product coming off of the FedEx plane so we can be prepared to support the story with visuals if this turns out the way we hope,” wrote Waters. 
Lenihan of the FDA told the group of health officials that “if it is the product we think it is and it is not toxic we will release it to ASPR” - the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, a division within HHS. 
Reached by email, Lenihan referred Reuters back to the FDA press office. Waters did not respond to an email seeking comment. 
One of the participants in the March 21 email discussion appeared to raise the issue of which agency should get credit for the deal. Joseph Hamel, ASPR’s manager of strategic innovation and emerging technology, asked in an email to the group: “How do you want to handle? FDA win? ASPR win? Happy either way, please let us know.” 
Hamel did not return an email seeking comment. 
Asked about the email exchanges, an HHS spokesman echoed the FDA’s statement, saying the agency would not comment on “alleged, leaked emails.” 
‘GROSS FAILURE’ 
The pills and ingredients welcomed by the administration had origins that should have raised red flags and prompted greater scrutiny, said the three sources who spoke to Reuters. 
In 2015, Bayer’s plant in Pakistan, Bayer Pakistan Private Ltd, was cited by that country’s regulators for making Resochin that was lower in potency than labeled, according to inspection documents reviewed by Reuters. 
A whistleblower complaint led to the discovery of more than 21 million Resochin tablets that were too weak, more than 12% under the specified weight of 400 milligrams, according to the Pakistani regulatory records. 
Officials blamed the problem on a “gross failure” of manufacturing operations, citing improperly calibrated machines, poorly trained workers and insufficient staffing. Weak medications can fail to treat the illness for which they’re prescribed and harm patients. 
The investigation was ultimately resolved with Bayer’s agreement to destroy the 21 million doses. 
Regarding the 2015 incident, the company told Reuters: “All batches produced with lower content due to an error in production were never released, the corresponding batches destroyed.” 
According to FDA records reviewed by Reuters, the active ingredients for the drug are made at a plant in Indore, India, run by Ipca Laboratories Ltd, an Indian drug manufacturer and ingredient supplier that exports its products globally. 
In 2016, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ipca regarding three of its plants in India that make chloroquine ingredients and finished pills for companies other than Bayer. The plants did not include the one making the active ingredient for Bayer’s Resochin. Nonetheless, the U.S. government sources said, Ipca’s troubled history calls into question its general practices. 
The FDA found the company was deleting, manipulating and fabricating laboratory data, according to the agency’s records. The company vowed at the time to “resolve these issues at the earliest.” 
In 2017, the agency restricted drugs and ingredients from those three plants from entering the U.S. market, a regulatory sanction called an import alert. Then in August 2019, the FDA accused one of the Ipca plants of a “cascade of failure” for not properly maintaining its quality data, agency records show. 
Ipca did not respond to questions from Reuters about its track record with the FDA. 
On March 20, a day after Trump praised the antimalarial drug from the podium, the FDA lifted its import alert for Ipca’s chloroquine ingredients and completed tablets from the three restricted plants, according to a March 21 statement filed by Ipca with the Indian stock exchange. 
The company pledged in the statement to adhere to stringent manufacturing standards, “and thus help mankind in the best possible way in these testing times.”

Alix Monteleone, a 28-year-old account supervisor, who lives in a trendy part of Bushwick with her 33-year old fiance, Marc Kozlow, described what the two have witnessed peering out their window. 
“We have a bird’s eye view,” Monteleone said, during a recent interview conducted by Reuters via Skype. 
“We’re seeing so much chaos manifest outside of our home that we can’t imagine how bad it is inside. You know, we stopped counting how many bodies came out,” she said. “This is very serious. This is very real.” 
As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has now claimed more lives than did the attacks of September 11, the city has been forced to take over new spaces to absorb the loss. 
Emergency field hospitals have been set up in Central Park and other locales. And refrigerated trucks have fanned out across the city to process the pileup of corpses. 
As of Wednesday, New York state has had nearly 150,000 reported coronavirus cases and over 6,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
In her interview with Reuters, Monteleone recounted how she and her fiance discovered their front-row seat to the pandemic. 
When Kozlow was walking their dog last week, he called to tell her that he overheard two doctors saying the trucks would be coming in. Shortly after, Monteleone said she “turned around on the couch and peered out the window and saw it.” 
“This is what they were saying online was going to be mobilized throughout the city.” 
The following morning the couple awoke to workers setting up a platform and a ramp to serve two refrigerated trucks. 
It wasn’t long after that the couple saw “a pretty serious string of bodies.” 
Monteleone commended the head of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Ramon Rodriguez, for checking in on the neighbors. 
She said the couple were staying put - for now. 
“Everybody in my personal and professional life has urged us to leave. They don’t think this is a good place to be,” she said.

In what has become a weekly event, organised largely on social media, people across Britain stand on their doorsteps at 8 p.m. to give a round of applause for the National Health Service in a public display of support. 
Last week, Johnson joined in with the applause from the steps of Downing Street, despite being in self-isolation after having tested positive for coronavirus on the day of the first time the event happened, March 27. 
But within a few days he went to hospital because his symptoms persisted, and was transferred into intensive care on Monday, a move which brought home to many the severity of COVID-19. 
“Thank you to all of those who are looking after us in our time of need,” Raab said at the government’s daily news conference on Thursday. 
“For the doctors and nurses who have died of coronavirus whilst caring for others, we will never forget their sacrifice, we will never forget their devotion to helping others,” he added. 
Support for the NHS is widespread in Britain, with football clubs announcing financial aid packages and donations of equipment, for example, and landmarks across the country turning blue last week, the colour of the NHS logo. 
But the government has been criticised for failing to provide sufficient protective gear to frontline health workers. 
Raab acknowledged there had been challenges with the distribution of gear but said the army was helping deliver it.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in hospitals rose by 5,233, or 9%, to 64,338 on Friday, health ministry director Jerome Salomon said at a daily briefing. 
Salomon also reported a total of 17,827 confirmed or suspected cases in nursing homes, compared to 14,638 on Thursday, when the nursing home data were first reported. 
By including the nursing home data, France now has a total of 82,165 confirmed or suspected cases. It joined the United States, Spain, Italy and Germany as nations that have now surpassed cases reported by China, where the pandemic originated, according to a Reuters tally. 
Excluding the nursing home data, the number of people dying from COVID-19 in French hospitals also set a new daily record of 588, an increase of 13% to 5,091, health ministry data showed. 
The ministry did not provide a breakdown for deaths per day in nursing homes, but said a provisional cumulative death tally since the start of the epidemic rose to 1,416 on Friday, an increase of 532 over the 884 first reported on Thursday. 
Following criticism about French COVID-19 statistics not reflecting the dozens of people dying in senior citizens’ residences or their own homes, the health ministry on Thursday provided the first data on deaths in nursing homes. 
Elderly people living in close quarters in nursing homes are particularly vulnerable to the highly contagious virus. 
The provisional nursing home tally while still incomplete accounts for more than a fifth of all French COVID-19 deaths. 
One glimmer of hope came from another key metric. The number of patients in intensive care units (ICU) rose by 263 to 6,662, an increase of just 4%, as the growth in patients requiring ICU beds has come down from double-digit numbers in recent days. 
But Salomon said it was too soon to call the peak of the epidemic. 
“The number of people in ICU is not going down, even if the increase is slowing down, but we still need more beds and more teams to handle an ever-growing number of people,” he said.

After initially recommending people avoid taking ibuprofen to treat symptoms of the new coronavirus disease, as of March 19 the WHO now does not recommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms.
The confusion began after Frances Minister of Solidarity and Health Oliver Véranannounced on Twitter that taking anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen or cortisone) could be a factor in worsening a COVID-19 infection. He recommended that paracetamol should be taken instead to treat the associated fever.
At the moment, the NHS only recommends taking paracetamol for COVID-19 symptoms, even though it admits there is no strong evidence showing ibuprofen worsens symptoms. The BMJ also states that ibuprofen should be avoided when managing COVID-19 symptoms.
Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, normally have three main uses: they help with inflammation, pain, and fever. People might also take them for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and for pain. However, paracetamol can also help treat pain and fever.
Fever is a higher than normal body temperature, and is one of the signs of COVID-19, along with a persistent cough and shortness of breath. The body develops a fever as a defence mechanism, where the immune system produces a chain of molecules that tell the brain to make and keep more heat inside to fight the infection.
While getting fever during an infection is part of the bodys defence mechanism, a serious rise in body temperature can be fatal and should be treated. Having fever is also uncomfortable because it often comes with shivering, headaches, nausea and stomach upsets. Taking an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or paracetamol will bring down a high temperature by lowering some of the fever molecules. However, doctors who compared the two in 2013 suggested taking paracetamol over ibuprofen for normal chest infections because they found a small number of peoples illness got worse with ibuprofen.
Some of the reasons that theres a concern taking ibuprofen will make COVID-19 symptoms worse comes from previous studies that have shown people with other serious chest infections (such as pneumonia) experienced worse symptoms and prolonged illness after taking an NSAID, including ibuprofen.
But its difficult to say if taking ibuprofen in these instances directly causes worse symptoms and prolonged illness, or if its because taking ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories help manage pain, which may hide how serious the illness is and could stop people from asking for help earlier delaying treatment. Or, it might be to do with ibuprofens anti-inflammatory effects. One theory is that anti-inflammatory medicines can interfere with some of the bodys immune response, although this is not proven for ibuprofen.
However, two French studies warn doctors and pharmacists not to give NSAIDs when they see signs of chest infections, and that NSAIDs shouldnt be given when children are infected with viruses. Theres no agreement on why ibuprofen could make chest infections worse, but both studies reported worse outcomes in patients who had taken a NSAID to treat their condition.
A recent letter to The Lancet suggested that ibuprofens harm in COVID-19 is to do with its effect on an enzyme in the body called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) though this has yet to be proven. This caused additional worries for patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for existing heart conditions. Severalleadingorganizations have rightly warned patients not to stop taking their regular medicines in light of unconfirmed theories.
Because novel coronavirus is a new type of virus, there is currently no evidence proving that taking ibuprofen will be harmful or make COVID-19 symptoms worse. Research in this area is developing fast, but with so much misinformation about COVID-19 and ibuprofen use, the cautious approach is to avoid ibuprofen with COVID-19 if at all possible especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. Anyone who thinks they might have COVID-19 can consider using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen for managing their fever, unless theyre told otherwise by their doctor or pharmacist.
In the meantime, the UKs Committee of Human Medicines and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have been asked to review all the evidence to understand ibuprofens impact on COVID-19 symptoms. Naturally, people already prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug for a health condition should ask their doctors opinion and not just stop their medication.
Paracetamol can also treat fever, as well as aches and pains. Maderla/ Shutterstock
Its worth noting, however, that ibuprofen and NSAIDs can trigger stomach ulcers and indigestion and might not be suitable for some people with heart disease, kidney and liver problems, and asthma, as well as people over 65, and those who drink more alcohol. These drugs should not be used in people with very high blood pressure, and women trying to get pregnant or already pregnant.
Paracetamol, which can also treat pain and fever, may be preferred. Though it takes up to an hour to work, its safe to use for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and can be taken with or without food. Some people need to take extra care with paracetamol and should speak with their doctor or pharmacist first, for example if they have liver or kidney problems.
The usual dose of paracetamol for adults is one or two 500 milligram tablets up to four times in 24 hours, with at least four hours in between doses. Most people use a syrup to give paracetamol to children. How much to give depends on your childs age, but again paracetamol should only be given up to four times in 24 hours, with at least four hours between doses.
Pharmacies have been running short of paracetamol and some shops have been rationing sales. For those exhibiting symptoms, a box of 32 tablets should last for at least four days. At this time of crisis, its important people make sure theyre not stockpiling medicines unnecessarily and depriving others who are equally in need of paracetamol and other vital drugs.

Form a COVID-19 task force and command room
Establish a team from different functions to assess your organizations coronavirus needs and risks. The team should include representatives from your key functions, including supply chain, human resources, communications, operations, sales, legal, health, safety and environment (HSE), and more.
Determine the task forces command and decision-making structure. For key decisions, who is the ultimate authority and who needs to be informed? See the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (U.S. CDC): Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease.
<ul><li>Only specific, appointed people from your organizations COVID-19 task force should be communicating about the companys situation with employees and external audiences (media, investors, customers, suppliers, local government, etc.).</li><li>Its important to agree internally about what will be communicated before any announcements are made to assure that messaging will be consistent across different audiences. Develop message development protocols that will enable prompt drafting and approval of statements so that communications can be completed in a timely way and not bogged down by endless edits. Consider when legal approval of statements may be necessary. Spokespeople should only answer questions they know the answers to. Its a bad practice to give a best guess answer. Instead, questioners should be told, Well look into this and get back to you as soon as possible.</li><li>Be prepared to provide timely updates as necessary and inform stakeholders where they can go for additional information or questions.</li><li>Regarding corporate travel, see the World Health Organizations (WHO) written travel guidelines for COVID-19.</li><li>Do a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threat) analysis. What protocols for cleanliness does your organization have or need? Is your custodial staff increasing its cleaning and disinfection of touch surfaces (restrooms, door knobs, kitchen and dining areas)? Do they have the correct personal protective equipment? They should avoid cleaning methods that might aerosolize pathogens (pressure washing, steam cleaning). What emergencies should you plan for?</li></ul>
Monitor communications updates from your industrys leading associations, as well as public health organizations
Develop a protocol system for monitoring daily, hourly and emergency information.
<ul><li>Keep in mind that disinformation travels as fast or faster than accurate information. Fake news about COVID-19 is being spread rapidly around the world, including by some government officials with no background in public health. Your organization should seek advice from scientific and medical officials with experience in epidemiology, such as those in the WHO, the U.S. CDC, or similar national government health organizations in other countries (see list below). The WHO is publishing daily bulletins on the status of the virus, has developed instructions for dealing with the virus, and has produced a document on COVID-19 myths. The organizations Q&amp;A on COVID-19 is also very helpful.</li><li>Monitor travel advisories through your national health authority. The list of countries placed under travel advisories continues to grow. If employees or their immediate family members travel to a country under a travel advisory or have been in contact with someone who has, you should instruct them to stay home and self-quarantine for two weeks.</li></ul>
Develop contingency plans for each of your audiences and organizational functions
Should an outbreak occur near your offices, what should happen first, second, and third? Who is authorized to make prompt decisions? Who should be informed? By what communications methods? What messages should they hear? What are the protocols for providing updates?
Create a communications plan
Review your audiences needs. Who are the key stakeholders with need for information from your organization? What information do they need, who needs it first and for what purpose?
Consider focusing your efforts around empowerment, practice, and compliance. Its vital that people understand the importance of complying with practices such as handwashing and good hygiene to keep themselves and others safe, but you can communicate this importance in an accessible, friendly manner.
Develop messaging and communications strategies for each audience, and assign a communications lead. What communications tools will you need? How will you communicate with each audience should your organization need to work differently (text, email, website, etc.)? Have you tested your emergency communications system and tools? What should your tone be always (e.g. calm, reasoned) and never (e.g. panicked)?
Develop an HR action plan
Explore what the rules will be if your employees need to work from home. Will pay continue as normal? What about non-salaried employees? What does your government require? Review telecommuting policies and accountability. Beware of bias, discrimination and exclusion at your organization, and always be protective of employee personal privacy and confidentiality as required by law. Follow up on reports of discrimination and respond to concerns.
Communicate with your employees
Prepare statements/intranet news for employees and regularly pass on information to them.
Reference the aforementioned U.S. CDC section aimed at employers with guidelines on preparing your company for an outbreak of the virus. Educate employees about the virus, including: How it is spread and what they can do to protect themselves and others around them. Refer to the WHO document The Rational Use of Personal Protective Equipment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This document explains why face masks are not appropriate for the general public except for healthcare workers and people who are ill. It also provides information on what preventative measures do work.
Communicate on a regular basis with employees to let them know of any ongoing developments and what the company is doing to handle COVID-19. Truthful communication will build trust, while lack of information or disinformation will result in mistrust. If an employee tests positive for the virus, tell the employees they have been in contact with that they have been exposed to the virus at work. (However, respecting sick employees privacy is important, so dont reveal their names.)
Do you communicate current status via live ticker on the intranet? The U.S. CDC has four risk categories for individuals. It may be helpful to share these with employees. Some employees may be reassured to learn that they are not at risk. Sick employees at work should be isolated from other employees and sent home immediately. Tell employees that if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, they should not come to work and should stay home until they have had no fever for 24 hours.
These are the lifeblood of your organizations business and mission. Maintaining their trust and confidence during a potential coronavirus-related disruption is critical. 
Identify the concerns of your customers (clients, patients, students, hotel guests, etc.). Develop messaging that assures customers your organization has done all it can to ensure consistent delivery of products and services they need and expect. If there are delays in processes, timing, substitutions, etc., make sure your customers are informed.
Let your customers know what steps your business has taken to protect them from exposure to the virus. Provide resources for additional online information, and let customers know how they can get answers to their questions. Consider an FAQ document with business questions your customers will ask and/or setting up a hotline as appropriate. Stay in regular touch with your customers with updated information, including after things return to normal.
Prepare for media inquiries
Prepare statements for the press and website news. Keep in mind this may not be the best time to release company news. Journalists care about how the COVID-19 outbreak affects the global economy, and what each countrys prevention efforts are. Media outlets are devoting time and budget to covering those topics.
For example, in Korea, SK Hynix, Samsung, and Hyundai facilities have had to shut down for one to two weeks because employees have been sick with coronavirus. This type of news is high-priority for Korean and Japanese editors, and they are not likely to focus right now on topics like product launches (such activities should be delayed if media coverage is considered very important).
In China, the media is trying to get back to normal, with the encouragement of the Chinese government, even though the outbreak is still very serious there. Consider which messaging about your organization may clear up confusion for potential travelers. For example, journalists covering the travel and tourism industry will want to know if a property has changed its cancelation policies due to the virus, and whether visitors are at financial risk if they need to cancel or postpone their trip because of a sudden outbreak of the virus in the community the plan to visit.
Most companies will probably not want to comment on how the virus outbreak may or may not be affecting their business. I recommend that organizations only discuss their policies relating to the outbreak, their advice to employees on staying healthy, and their plans to keep meeting customer needs.
Consider possible questions from the media on the following topics
(These questions are relevant for preparing communication materials as well.)
Supply chain and production
Is production capacity guaranteed? What activities have been initiated to prepare for large numbers of sick employees? Is a temporary shutdown of production being considered in case of a pandemic?
Are you partnering with officials and other organizations (WHO, national health authorities, etc.) to stay informed?
Are responsibilities within your company for addressing certain aspects of the virus outbreak clear (occupational safety expert, company doctor, etc.)?
Procedures
Is there a special guide or plan of action for various situations? How long do you estimate it will take for your organization to get back to normal?
Are staff responsibilities clear in case of a crisis?
What actions have you taken to secure the safety of your employees (work-at-home options, free sanitizers, etc.)?
Which employees and business units can work from home?
According to The New York Times and other experts, COVID-19 may come back more strongly later this year. Evaluate your practices and plan to sustain them. Monitor the effectiveness of communication to different audiences. Immediately address fear and prejudice against different groups of people directly and with science-based facts.
Consider the WHO/UNICEF/International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Guide to Preventing and Addressing Social Stigma.

Its a frighteningly small price to pay considering you get so many great games in return.
The charities benefiting from the Humble Conquer COVID-19 Bundle include Doctors Without Borders, Partners in Health, and Direct Relief. Says Humble on the bundle page: In the wake of COVID-19 and its effects around the world, weve teamed up with a team of developers, publishers, and creators to bundle a care package of much-needed funds to support organizations responding to the pandemic and its consequences.
Help conquer #COVID19 with this special one-week bundle featuring over $1000 in games and ebooks for just $30. 100% of the proceeds from your bundle purchase go to support organizations responding to COVID-19. https://t.co/HGcpHEW6JZpic.twitter.com/ZCZf2XpWzr
 Humble Bundle (@humble) March 31, 2020
According to Humble, the full price of all the content is $1,071. Its worth noting Humble allows you to set a custom price on its bundles so if youre feeling generous and want to contribute directly to the relief efforts while still getting a little something for yourself, you could pay the full price for those games while checking out. According to the Top Contributors section, several buyers have paid in excess of four figures.

I mean, if nothing else, get it because the games in the bundle fucking rock. Were talking Psychonauts, Brütal Legend, Undertale, Hollow Knight, Superhot thats quite enough awesome content to keep any gamer occupied for months, especially for only a $30 price tag. Im pretty sure I paid more than that for both of the first Darksiders games, which are also included in this bundle by the way.
And even if the games dont attract you by themselves, the bundle also includes several books and comics. The latter includes The Boys, Fairy Tail, Saga, and Spawn bit of a motley collection, but still pretty good. The ebooks include a few selections on mindfulness and programming. It even includes Music Maker EDM Edition, for some reason, along with a free month of Humbles Choice subscription service. Theres not really a theme here, but thats okay the point is to have a sufficiently awesome reward for giving to charity, and hopefully induce some to give more than the bargain-basement asking price.
The offer ends on Tuesday, April 7.

It's what the protesters in Colorado, Wisconsin, and Michigan have demanded in their push to reopen non-essential businesses. It's the goal politicians and public-health experts have in mind when developing roadmaps to help states forge a safe path back to some level of normalcy.
But those plans require far more testing than the US is now doing, even after a recent ramp-up. Experts also still want a more accurate sense of how many Americans have been infected already.
In addressing the latter issue, antibody testing offers a tempting promise: Such tests can identify whether a person already had COVID-19 — even if they never showed symptoms — and is therefore likely immune.
At least 140 US biotech companies are racing to develop these tests; seven have gotten emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, as has a test at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.

""Ultimately, this might help us figure out who can get the country back to normal,"" Florian Krammer, a virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, told Reuters in March. ""People who are immune could be the first people to go back to normal life and start everything up again.""
But ""ultimately"" is a long way off. As of now, we still lack several critical pieces of information about antibodies and immunity: Scientists don't know whether everyone who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies, and they don't know the extent to which those antibodies protect us from reinfection.
""We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection — what we don't know right now is how strong that protection is, and if that's seen in everybody that is infected, and for how long that lasts,"" Maria Van Kerkove, an expert with the World Health Organization, said in a press briefing on Monday.
Plus, antibody tests aren't always accurate.
Does everyone who gets the coronavirus develop antibodies?
Coronavirus antibody tests, also known as serological tests, use a few drops of your blood to determine whether your body has developed proteins that fight the virus. If so, that means you've gotten infected, recovered, and might be immune. These tests differ from the diagnostic tests that determine whether someone has an active COVID-19 infection.

Research so far shows most patients develop antibodies: A small study from European researchers found that three coronavirus patients had antibodies less than three weeks after being infected. A March study in the journal Nature reported, similarly, that patients formed antibodies within weeks.
But a recent paper found that of 175 recovered COVID-19 patients in China, 6% didn't develop any detectable antibodies at all. About 70% of those studied developed high levels of antibodies around 10 to 15 days after the disease's onset, while one-quarter of the patients developed low levels of the neutralizing proteins. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed, however.
We don't know how long antibodies confer immunity
Generally, once your body has antibodies to fight off a particular disease, you can't get it again. But some types of antibodies weaken over time.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it's unlikely that people would get the coronavirus more than once — at least within a short time period.
""If this virus acts like every other virus that we know, once you get infected, get better, clear the virus, then you'll have immunity that will protect you against re-infection,"" Fauci recently told ""The Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah.

But scientists still aren't sure how long coronavirus antibodies last, since the virus has not been around for enough time to study long-term effects. Previous research on SARS, a closely related coronavirus, found that antibodies disappeared after two years.
Some reports have already described people who've recovered and then tested positive for the coronavirus again later. This was the case for a Japanese tour guide who got sick, got better, then tested positive three weeks later. Doctors aren't sure if she was reinfected or had not fully recovered from the first infection.
The South Korean CDC also recently reported that 51 patients there who recovered from the coronavirus tested negative then positive again within a relatively short time.
Some tests don't accurately sniff out antibodies
Even assuming patients do develop antibodies that confer immunity, we don't yet have many fool-proof ways to detect them.
In the US, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization to eight antibody tests. The agency reviews data from the test manufacturers when considering these EUAs, but the green light is still ""less rigorous than securing FDA approval for a new diagnostic test,"" FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn told Politico. 
There are also plenty of tests out there that do not have any kind of FDA approval — EUA or otherwise. That's because the agency announced on March 16 that in order to afford test developers ""flexibility,"" companies could begin distributing antibody test kits without any authorization or scientific review by the agency. Those companies are simply required to validate their own tests, warn anyone who takes them, and notify the FDA. 
""The FDA does not review the validation, or accuracy, data for these tests unless an EUA is submitted,"" the agency said in a statement.
Hundreds of those unapproved tests have since flooded the market.

But of course, tests that have not been vetted can yield unreliable information. Last week, two teams of California-based scientists reported the results of antibody surveys in Santa Clara County and Los Angeles County. The findings suggested that the number of infected people in the counties could be up to 85 times and 55 times higher, respectively, than the number of confirmed cases. But it turned out that the antibody tests those surveys used were not FDA approved and had a false-positive rate nearly equal to the percentage of participants they found to have antibodies.
""Literally every single one could be a false positive,"" Marm Kilpatrick, a disease ecologist from the University of California, Santa Cruz, told BuzzFeed News. ""No one thinks all of them were, but the problem is we can't actually exclude the possibility.""
The concept of 'immunity passports'

Even if antibody tests were perfectly accurate, and all recovered patients were confirmed to have antibodies that confer immunity, it may still be unrealistic to think recovered people would then kick-start our economy any time soon.
Several countries, including Germany and Chile, are considering issuing ""immunity passports"" to recovered patients that would exempt them from lockdowns and social distancing. Fauci told CNN on April 7 that there could be ""merit"" to the idea of immunity certificates in the US.
""This is something that's being discussed,"" he said.

But experts at the WHO have discouraged governments from issuing this type of ""immunity"" certification. At this point in the pandemic, the organization stated, there is not enough evidence to indicate that recovered patients develop antibodies that guarantee protection from reinfection.
""The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,"" the organization said in a scientific brief.
What's more, the WHO estimates that no more than 2% to 3% of the global population has developed coronavirus antibodies.
An economy can't bounce back with just 2% to 3% of its workforce. Schools can't reopen with that small a sliver of teachers or students. So while accurate, robust, widespread antibody testing is needed, it's no silver bullet.

While the need for medical equipment technical manuals is pressing given the pandemic, it fits into a larger conversation. For years, right to repair proponents have argued that tech companies have prevented owners and independent technicians from completing basic fixes. Companies like Apple argue the repairs are too complex or not safe, though that’s debatable. Europe is already pushing for broader right to repair legislation, and the current demand for medical device service could make the battle more prominent in the US, too.
“We hope this also serves as an example about why restricting repair is harmful,” Proctor said. “It’s time we removed these repair restrictions for all the equipment in hospitals. We hope that manufacturers continue to expand their cooperation with independent technicians and hospital in-house biomeds to provide what they need to fix equipment.”"

Despite testing positive for COVID-19, Richardson said Montefiore Medical Center informed her that she would be required to work just seven days after her illness as long as she was not ""feverish.""
Richardson initially refused to work, fearing that she would be putting her coworkers and patients at risk — until she was forced to return to Montefiore Medical on April 2 still feeling ill. That same day, she was sent to the emergency room due to complications with COVID-19.
 ""I believe that I contracted COVID-19 due to my exposure at work and the lack of PPE,"" Richardson wrote in an affidavit.  
Richardson is hardly alone — as medical workers at the epicenter of the US outbreak continue to battle COVID-19, many have claimed that the New York State Department of Health (NYSDH) has failed to adequately protect its frontline medical workers by failing to provide PPE and give them adequate time to recover after contracting the virus. 
For this reason, Richardson and other nurses have joined a lawsuit filed by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) against the NYSDH over its coronavirus health policies and failing to provide PPE, allowing ""hospitals to become Petri dishes where the virus can fester and then spread to other health care workers, the patients, and the general population.""
""[NYSDH's] neglect of its statutory duties and disregard for the laws of this state have exacerbated rather than mitigated the ongoing crisis,"" the lawsuit read.
NYSNA also added that requiring health care workers to come back to work before they are fully recovered ""dangerously heightens the risk of exposure"" to their co-workers, patients, and their larger community.
All across the nation, medical workers have made clamorous calls for more PPE — the only protection they have against the highly contagious virus while treating patients with COVID-19. Although Cuomo recently stated in a March 28 news briefing that New York City officials informed him that they had finally received adequate PPE, nurses on the frontlines of the battle against the virus say otherwise.
In a survey of nurses who are members of NYSNA, 72% reported they had been exposed to COVID-19 at work, and 11%, or 9,514 NYSNA registered nurses, have tested positive for the virus. At least 84 have been hospitalized and eight members died after contracting COVID-19 — however, these numbers only include nurses who are members of the union, meaning that many more likely remain unaccounted for. 
NYSDH would not comment on the specific claims made by NYSNA nurses due to ""pending litigation.""
However, Jonah Bruno, NYSDH's director of communications said the state ""continues to take every step necessary to ensure that health care workers, particularly those who are sampling and providing direct care, have the support and supplies needed to address this unprecedented public health emergency.""
Several NYSNA nurses reported that their hospitals directed nurses with COVID-19 to return to work before they had recovered
Richardson began treating patients with COVID-19 symptoms on March 8 — but due to shortages of PPE, her hospital refused to give her any PPE besides surgical masks if a patient was coughing, according to the lawsuit.
Despite her repeated requests, she said, the director of their clinic refused to give her and another nurse practitioner personal protective equipment (PPE), claiming that N95 face masks were reserved for those treating patients ""suspected"" or known to be positive for COVID-19.

""Despite daily requests for PPE, I was not provided with any. We were instructed that we could only wear a surgical mask, which is not adequate protection against COVID-19, if the patient presented with a cough,"" Richardson wrote in a complaint. ""Otherwise we were prohibited from wearing surgical masks because management believed that doing so could alarm patients. 
By March 16, Richardson began coughing and running a fever. She was forced to get find a COVID-19 test on her own because her hospital claimed her exposure was not ""significant,"" her affidavit said. Several days later tests confirmed she had contracted the virus and on March 21 she began staying home to recover.
According to Richardson, Montefiore Medical Center insisted that she had to return to work if she was not feverish on March 28 — just seven days after she went home with a cough, a fever, and shortness of breath.
In her affidavit, Richardson noted she was at a higher risk of complications with COVID-19 due to her asthma.  Still, she returned to work on April 2 only to land in the emergency room at her local hospital when her conditioned worsened.  After a CT scan, Richardson was diagnosed with double-lobe pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
That test offered proof of her illness and gave Richardson the ability to insist that she could not work until she recovered. However, she claimed that Montefiore Medical only give her three COVID-19 sick days. Richardson had to use her own bank of sick days for the time she has taken to recover from COVID-19. 
NYSDH protocol allows healthcare providers to require sick medical workers to come back to work seven days after the onset of experiencing symptoms 
The NYSDH provided guidance to healthcare providers on protocols for medical personnel who have been exposed or infected by the virus. 
If a medical worker is confirmed or suspected of COVID-19, the NYSDH protocol states that personnel can be asked to come back to work if they have isolated for seven days after their symptoms first appeared.
A hospital can ask an employee to go back to treating patients so long as the employee has not had a fever for at least 72 hours without fever-reducing medication and the employee's other symptoms are improving, according to the most recent guidance from NYSDH document on the protocol.
While the time period reflects CDC guidelines for people with COVID-19 ending home isolation more broadly, healthcare workers are directly treating populations at risk of falling seriously ill from the disease.
The NYSNA also noted that the policy requiring medical workers to return to treating patients reflects an ""apparent disregard for the possibility of asymptomatic transmission.""
""While members of the general public are directed to self-quarantine for fourteen days...following the DOH's directive, [healthcare providers] are requiring health care workers to return to work after seven days, even when they are still symptomatic,"" NYSNA claimed in the lawsuit.
""This inevitably has serious health and safety consequences for the sick RNs, their patients, and their coworkers who could be exposed,"" the NYSNA added.

The NYSDH requires sick nurses returning to work after having been confirmed or suspected of contracting the virus to wear a face mask for 14 days following the onset of their symptoms. But the protocol does not specify what kind of face masks sick medical workers should wear or include any other requirements for PPE to use while continuing to treat patients. 
The nurses' union also alleged in the lawsuit that the NYSDH acknowledges that employees may still be infectious. One NYSNA nurse claimed that she was asked to work while running a fever topping 103 degrees. The NYSDH protocol also required that medical personnel confirmed or suspected of having the virus to ""quarantine themselves when not at work.""
The NYSNA demanded this directive be rescinded immediately, claiming that the protocol not only contributed to the spread of COVID-19, but that it violates New York's coronavirus paid sick leave law which requires at least 14 days of paid sick leave for public employees.
""[NYSDH's] determination and protocols providing that nurses and other healthcare professionals are fit for duty after just 7 days of recovery, despite scientific evidence and explicit state law to the contrary, is arbitrary and capricious and affected by an error of law,"" the lawsuit read.
It continued: ""This has caused serious illness and death for nurses and other frontline health care workers and created a state-wide public nuisance contributing to, rather than combatting, the spread of COVID-19 throughout New York State and beyond.""

Fans will get an opportunity to play Riots Overwatch-meets-Counter-Strike game Valorant very soon: today, the developer announced that a closed beta will be launching on April 7th. Its not clear just how big the beta will be or how long it will last, but Riot says that prospective players will need to link their Riot and Twitch accounts to be eligible. When closed beta activates in your region, watch specific Valorant streams highlighted on Twitch for the opportunity to be entitled for closed beta access, the developer explains. (Check out the official site for full details.)
We have to focus on the regions where we feel most ready.
The beta wont be entirely global, at least not at launch. Instead, it will be available to players in Canada, Europe, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. According to Valorant executive producer Anna Donlon, the limited number of regions is due to the ongoing pandemic. Our plan was to bring the Valorant closed beta to as many players around the world as quickly as possible, but the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted those plans, compromising a wider global rollout, she said in a statement. For now, we have to focus on the regions where we feel most ready, with more regions following in the months to come.
Valorant was first teased last October under the codename Project A. Its Riots first title outside of the League of Legends universe, and its a 5v5 competitive game that looks to combine the tactical shooter gameplay of CS:GO with the superpowers and colorful characters of Overwatch. The full game is slated to launch on PC sometime this summer."

Image: Apple
HBO has decided to continue supporting second- and third-generation Apple TV set-top boxes after initially saying that HBO Go and HBO Now would no longer work on them as of April 30th. The news comes from AppleInsider, which confirmed the change with an HBO spokesperson. 
The extension for HBO Now isnt all that long; HBO will only keep that app working on older Apple TVs until May 15th. But the company has promised to keep HBO Go the one you use if you receive HBO through a cable, satellite, or internet TV provider functional for a few additional months. 
Hopefully, thatll be enough to last through the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine life. HBO has made some of its content free to everyone during the current health crisis as people seek entertainment to help them temporarily escape from the crush of news about the novel coronavirus. 
These are old Apple TV devices were talking about. The third-gen Apple TV was launched in 2012, with the second-gen model preceding it in 2010. Since then, Apple has released the fourth-generation Apple TV (later rebranded as Apple TV HD) and the top-end Apple TV 4K. Heres how to tell which model youve got, but its also easy to distinguish by software: only the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K run the more modern tvOS, whereas prior Apple TV devices remain on the original, simpler software. If youre still holding on to one of those, it might be time to upgrade to a current model or a newer Roku or Fire TV. 
But thats probably not your first priority at the moment, and this is pretty much the worst possible time for any streaming app to end support for any piece of hardware."

How can I tell the difference between the flu and coronavirus? How can you stay healthy when using Uber or Lyft?,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-q-and-a-thursday-march-12/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200311235712-04-coronavirus-outbreak-0311-tests-super-tease.jpg,2020-03-12T12:24:03Z,"(CNN)CNN readers are asking smart questions about coronavirus every day. So each weekday, we'll select some of the top questions and get you the answers.
Here are some of the most popular recent questions:
Q. Does donated blood get screened for coronavirus? 
At least 4.5 million people need donated blood every year, but this is the first time novel coronavirus has been a concern in the nation's blood supply. 
""Individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19 through the blood donation process or via a blood transfusion since respiratory viruses are generally not known to be transmitted by donation or transfusion,"" said the AABB, formerly the American Association of Blood Banks.
""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to report that there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19 to date,"" the group said. 
""In addition, no cases of transfusion-transmission were ever reported for the other two coronaviruses that emerged during the past two decades (SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and MERS-CoV, which causes Mideast Respiratory Syndrome).""
The AABB said routine screening measures are already in place to prevent anyone with clinical respiratory infections from donating blood.
But there is one big concern involving blood donations and coronavirus: the possibility that fewer people will come out to donate. 
""If the outbreak of coronavirus continues to spread, additional challenges may arise, which could potentially reduce the number of eligible donors,"" the AABB said.
Q. How do I stay healthy when using Uber or Lyft? 
Both rideshare companies said they're actively trying to protect customers and drivers from coronavirus. 
Uber said it is trying to give drivers with disinfectants to help keep their cars clean, and the company ""may temporarily suspend the accounts of riders or drivers confirmed to have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19.""
Uber said it's working with public health organizations who might tell them to pause an account. If that happens, Uber would suspend that account and those of any connected riders.
Uber also said it will protect drivers financially if they are asked to isolate themselves. 
""Any driver or delivery person who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is individually asked to self-isolate by a public health authority will receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their account is on hold,"" Uber said. 
""We've already helped drivers in some affected areas, and we're working to quickly implement this worldwide.""
Q. How can I tell whether I have coronavirus or the flu? What are the different symptoms?
Testing is the only way to know for sure. But there have been problems with coronavirus testing -- from faulty test kits to major shortages and delays in getting tested.
The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough, but shortness of breath is a common hallmark of coronavirus. 
Of course, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all. And asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus to others. 
So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
Anyone who recently traveled to a part of the world where coronavirus is widespread should do the same. 
Q. Can hand dryers kill coronavirus? 
No, bathroom hand dryers can't kill coronavirus, the World Health Organization says. Doctors say the best ways to protect yourself include: 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds. If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand santizer. 
-- Stay at least 3 feet away from anyone who might be infected, especially if they're coughing or sneezing.

The last 20 years have played host to a flurry of pathogen outbreaks; Foot and Mouth in 2001, SARS in 2003, Swine Flu in 2011, MERS in 2012, and Ebola and Zika in 2014.
Before that, there hadn't been a major influenza epidemic for 40 years.
So as head of the department of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London since 2012, Professor Neil Ferguson has not been short of work.
He modeled the spread of all those outbreaks, advising five UK prime ministers in the process. But all that seems like a practice run for 2020.
In February of this year, coherent data began emerging from northern Italy, the first place in Europe to feel the force of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in November. Cometh the hour, cometh the man.
""This virus is probably the one that concerns me the most of everything I've worked on,"" Ferguson said in an early TV interview on February 14.
Nine UK coronavirus tests had come back positive at the time. No one knew how bad the outbreak would become.

Ferguson, a slim, bespectacled 51-year-old typically seen in jeans, t-shirt, and suit jacket, formed Imperial's COVID-19 Response Team, dusted off a mathematical model he made 15 years ago, and set to work.
On March 16, around a month after the earlier interview, Ferguson delivered a bombshell 20-page paper to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The message was clear: 510,000 people could die if the government didn't abandon its current strategy of allowing the disease to spread.
""We were expecting herd immunity to build. We now realize it's not possible to cope with that,"" Professor Azra Ghani, who worked on the paper, said that evening.
On March 23, the UK scrapped ""herd immunity"" in favor of a suppression strategy, and the country made preparations for weeks of lockdown. Ferguson's study was responsible. 
His work has also informed the strategies pursued by the White House and the governments of France and Germany.
And it was successful. At the time of writing, ""only"" 18,000 people deaths have been recorded in Britain's hospitals — 28 times fewer than predicted under the old strategy.
""Professor Lockdown""
In the world of mathematical epidemiology, Ferguson is renowned for his accomplishments, temperament, and work ethic. Ferguson did not respond to interview requests for this story.   
Professor Christl Donnelly, who worked on the paper with Ferguson, told Business Insider: ""Neil works incredibly hard. He has been writing computer code himself in addition to attending many high-level advisory meetings and simultaneously leading our Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team.""
""Neil got a treadmill desk for his Imperial office, but he was disappointed that the speed was limited to walking speed,"" Donnelly, who has also been Ferguson's colleague for 20 years, said.
""He exercises with as much commitment as he works.""
Ferguson co-founded the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, based at Imperial, in 2008. It is the leading body advising national governments on pathogen outbreaks.
It gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with ""rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.""

Not long after Ferguson founded the centre came its first real test: the H1N1 epidemic, also known as Swine Flu.
""Conspiracy theorists feel this is not a coincidence,"" he joked to his Imperial students during a September 2016 lecture.
James Hay, a postdoctoral student at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, who spent years studying in Ferguson's department, also praised him.
He told Business Insider: ""I think what sets Neil apart is just how sharp his technical skills are and how clearly he thinks.""
""In academia, as you become more senior, the responsibilities shift away from writing code and solving maths problems towards big picture tasks. It's pretty exceptional that Neil is still so proficient at the technical side.""
""The general feeling from junior researchers that work with him is that he is fantastic at solving complex technical problems on the spot and is clear in communicating their solutions,"" Hay said.

Ferguson completed his PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Oxford in 1994, under the supervision of Professor John Wheater, a member of the Oxford Faculty of Physics.
Wheater told Business Insider: ""Neil was a pleasure to supervise. He was one of my best graduate students. He's a very smart guy, and he worked very hard, and I have nothing but good memories about that time.""
But Ferguson did not stick to physics, switching disciplines to mathematical biology, specifically epidemiology.
""Neil has very good judgement about what are the important problems to which he personally can make an important contribution to society,"" Wheater told Business Insider.  
""Patient zero""
It is no exaggeration that Ferguson's paper saved hundreds of lives.
But in the story,  there is an irony that he may have helped infect the highest levels of government with the virus.
On March 17, Ferguson strolled under the architrave of 10 Downing Street ahead of a 5 p.m. press conference where he would outline his findings. He greeted senior members of Johnson's cabinet, gave his speech, and left.
Ferguson woke at 4 a.m. the next morning with a high fever, interspersed with a dry cough. On March 19 he tested positive for the coronavirus.

""Which is a strange experience — to be infected by the virus one is modelling,"" he tweeted to his 108,000 followers. At 9 a.m., the next day, Ferguson dialed into his daily online meeting with colleagues.
In the days that followed, Johnson, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, health secretary Matt Hancock, and chief medical officer Chris Whitty reported symptoms of the virus.
It is impossible to say with any confidence where these infections had come from. But, inevitably, the question was asked: was Ferguson ""patient zero"" for infecting Britain's elite?
A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister declined to comment on who had infected him.
Ferguson himself says he could have got it anywhere.
""I've been in so many meetings in the last few weeks, and a number of my colleagues from other universities who've been advising government in those meetings have also developed symptoms,"" he told the BBC's ""Today"" program on March 18. 
Johnson, Whitty, and Hancock tested positive on March 26. Cummings followed suit on March 30. Johnson spent three nights in intensive care, and has retreated from day-to-day government to recuperate.
""Families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""
Earlier, on March 12, as the UK's coronavirus outbreak was gaining speed, Johnson announced that the UK would pursue ""herd immunity.""  
This involved eschewing the social distancing tactics advocated by the World Health Organization and letting the virus infect as many people as possible so they could develop immunity. 
It was earlier research from Ferguson and Imperial — before the prediction of 510,000 deaths — which helped underpin the strategy. Few other countries chose the same path.
""This is the guy who screwed up the original model,"" Fox News host Laura Ingraham put it in a tweet after the government scrapped the herd immunity approach.
The UK characterized its approach as the sure way to counter a deeply troubling situation. With no trace of his usual optimism, Johnson said: ""Many families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""

500 scientists, most experts on infectious diseases, signed a letter on March 14, calling for Johnson to abandon the plan and enforce social distancing.
Professor John Ashton, a leading public health expert, accused the government of dragging its feet, ""behaving like 19th-century colonialists playing a five-day game of cricket."" 
There was no news from 10 Downing Street.
On March 16, Ferguson went back to Johnson with the new, game-changing paper. It said the UK death toll would peak on May 15, and reach staggering levels.
""Suppression is the only viable strategy,"" it concluded. 
However, doubt has been cast on the government's reliance on models to direct their response to virus outbreaks.
""I am an epidemiologist, and I worry that the response is based too much on epidemiology alone,"" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, told the Financial Times.
In 2009, one of Ferguson's models predicted 65,000 people could die from the Swine Flu outbreak in the UK — the final figure was below 500. 
""That prediction wasn't just nonsense, was it?"" BBC presenter Nick Robinson asked health secretary Matt Hancock on the ""Today"" program on April 16.

""He does have, to be fair, a lot of critics""
Scientists have piled in to criticize Ferguson's paper in less uncertain terms.
""Some of the major assumptions and estimates that are built in the calculations seem to be substantially inflated,"" John Ioannidis, a professor of disease prevention from Stanford University, told The Telegraph.
Michael Thrusfield, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at Edinburgh University, told the paper he had ""déjà vu"" after reading the Imperial paper, saying Ferguson was responsible for excessive animal culling during the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak.
Ferguson warned the government that 150,000 people could die. Six million animals were slaughtered as a precaution, costing the country billions in farming revenue. In the end, 200 people died. 
Similarly, he was accused of creating panic by overestimating the potential death toll during the 2005 Bird Flu outbreak. Ferguson estimated 200 million could die. The real number was in the low hundreds. 
""I much prefer to be accused of overreacting than under-reacting,"" Ferguson said in February. On April 16, he told an IMF meeting,""We don't have a crystal ball.""
One contemporary noted that it is inherent to Ferguson's work that his predictions will not always materialize.
Professor Paul Hunter, a member of the Epidemiology and Public Health group at the University of East Anglia who appeared on the same panel as Ferguson on March 17, told Business Insider: ""The modelling area is particularly dangerous area because it's so uncertain, and because there is a big risk with all models and all modelers that they overstate, or run the risk of overstating, their own ... importance.""
Hunter said: ""He does have, to be fair, a lot of critics around in the UK modelling world.""
However, Ferguson's role in the Foot and Mouth outbreak is remembered as overwhelmingly positive. Queen Elizabeth II awarded him the Order of the British Empire in 2002 in 2002 for advising Tony Blair's government. 
His paper also received as many endorsements.
Professor Tim Colbourn, at the UCL Institute for Global Health, said: ""This is an excellent piece of work from some of the world's best infectious disease modelers and presents the models and policy options clearly.
Professor Stephen Griffin, from the Leeds Institute of Medical Research (LIMR) called it an ""excellent study.""
A household name
Imperial, based in South Kensington, has a shining reputation.
Governments around the world use Imperial research to underpin policy decisions, and their staff are among the world's most influential scientists. 
Dr Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator to the Trump administration, told journalists at a March 16 press briefing that the Imperial paper prompted the CDC's new advice to work from home and avoid gatherings of 10 or more.
Ferguson's report was also used to inform this graph displayed behind Trump at a March 31 press briefing:

C-SPAN
""We had new information coming out from a model, and what had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not going in public in large groups,"" Birx said.
The White House received the paper two days before it was made public.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the paper was cited in a March 20 report by the Robert Kock Institute, a federal agency that supplies the government there with public health advice. 
And on April 7, France's health minister Olivier Véran used a separate paper from Ferguson's team at Imperial, which estimated that 2,500 French lives were saved by confinement, to justify the government's measures. 
Keys to the castle 
Some scientists have taken issue with Ferguson over the workings of his model, because Ferguson alone holds the only key to analyze his research.
The micro-simulation model used to map the coronavirus was built in 2005, when Ferguson predicted how Thailand would react to a mutated avian flu outbreak. 
""One must ask: Why we are still using models developed 15–20 years ago?"" said the authors of a critique of the paper published in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology.
Mike Cates, who in 2015 took over from Stephen Hawking as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, leads a rival coronavirus modelling effort at The Royal Society and says there is great risk in relying on Ferguson's model alone. 
""We need some alternative models because very big decisions are being made based on the [Imperial] models. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the Imperial model. It's just that you can't have one model, which has in it every possible different set of assumptions,"" Cates told The Times of London.
Another expert, Professor Søren Brage, from the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider that it is essential that the workings of models like Ferguson's are scrutinized.
The University of Oxford.

""Modelling is an important sub-discipline of epidemiology which effectively attempts to predict possible future scenarios under different assumptions, and it is only right that those assumptions are scrutinized as they are very influential in the models,"" Brage said.
However, code sharing and documentation are often at the bottom of a scientist's to-do list, according to Hay, the Harvard expert and former colleague of Ferguson.
""The pressure is on doing science and publishing results, which means that these sorts of peripheral tasks often get left by the wayside,"" he said. ""Neil is an excellent scientist with a lot of experience in this area.""
Ferguson said on March 22 that he was working with GitHub and Microsoft to make his model widely available for use, but that he couldn't spare ""multiple days"" to train people to use it.
An old Oxford scandal which still has echoes today
While all this was going on, a spat was emerging between Ferguson's team at Imperial, and the evolutionary ecology of infectious disease unit at the University of Oxford, led by Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology Sunetra Gupta.
On March 24, Gupta's team published a paper that said the UK death rate suggested that 50% of the population may already have the coronavirus.
The suggestion was covered widely in the press, and seemed to imply the virus had been badly misunderstood.
The authors said their results, ""suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries.""
Speaking to the Financial Times, Gupta said she supported social distancing and lockdown measures taken by the government, but was ""surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model.""
She later told The Times of London that ""it's tricky to use them [Imperial's model] to forecast what's going to happen. We need to also consider alternatives.""

Ferguson said on March 27 that there was no bad blood between the two. ""Sunetra and I have always got on. I never fell out with her, and actually she will give you the same view,"" he told The Telegraph.
However, he did cast doubt on her team's findings.
""We don't think [Gupta's model] is consistent with the observed data,"" he told the Science and Technology Committee of the UK Parliament.
""Those data all point to the fact that we are nowhere near the [Oxford] scenario in terms of the extent of the infection.""
However, it could have been Ferguson authoring an Oxford study, if it weren't for a gossipy scandal that rocked the tiny world of epidemiology 20 years ago. 
Ferguson is an Oxford alumnus, who completed his masters and DPhil there between 1987 and 1994, whereupon he joined a 70-strong team of scientists working under Professor Sir Roy Anderson.
At the same time, Gupta was embarking on a five-year fellowship with the university's zoology department. By 1999 she was applying for a permanent position and was voted in — six-votes-to-two — by a panel from Oxford's zoology department.
But one of those who opposed her appointment was Anderson, who accused her of having an affair with a panel member, whose vote would, therefore, be called into question.
Gupta sued Anderson and won damages (subsequently donated to charity).
Anderson was suspended from his position as Linacre Professor of Zoology and later apologized profusely in a letter. He returned to work, but was later ousted by his department.
Upon leaving Anderson moved to St Mary's Hospital, run by Imperial College. He took his team with him — including Ferguson.
A spokeswoman for Anderson told Business Insider he was unable to comment, as he too was recovering from COVID-19.
A spokesperson for Professor Gupta told Business Insider she was unable to comment due to research commitments. 
""No exit strategy""
Ferguson revised his death toll estimate to 20,000 on March 25 after the UK government's lockdown, citing evidence suggesting that the plan was working. Nonetheless, he was not optimistic about the future.
""We will have to maintain some level of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available,"" Ferguson told BBC radio.
Ferguson, who said the government has ""no exit strategy,"" has heaped pressure on the government in recent days to develop a clear action plan.
In response, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""He advises government. He is not in the government.""
It is not a stretch to say that Ferguson has earned his moniker of ""Professor Lockdown.""
The impact of his team's paper is felt every day by the 66 million people living in the UK, and other nations which have embraced lockdowns.
During significant outbreaks, models are often relied upon by governments, and their authors placed under tremendous scrutiny. It is tough work.
""In outbreaks things are different,"" Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health who worked in Ferguson's department before leaving for the US, told Business Insider. 
""The responsibilities are a burden (in the case of a pandemic like this extraordinarily so), the days are long. Some people do better than others at handling what can be severe stress.""
""Some people have accused epidemiologists of enjoying the attention, or feeling relevant. The truth is that epidemiology is always relevant, and we would much rather that this was not happening.""
""But since it is happening it's our job to confront it, and to try to explain to the public what is happening. I'm looking forward to the day in the future when the pandemic is behind us, and we can be anonymous again.""

In an interview with a Sacramento television station on Thursday, Sacramento County Department of Health Services director Dr. Peter Beilenson confirmed at least 70 people at the Bethany Slavic Missionary Church were infected with Covid-19.
He said he named the church ""not to cast aspersions on anybody but to really hammer home the importance of not congregating, not only in church but also in prayer gatherings in people's homes."" It is one of the largest outbreak clusters of the virus in the US.
In an archived version of last Sunday's online service, a pastor announced at least three members of the church were infected with Covid-19.
However, the church released a statement Friday saying media reports about the Covid-19 outbreak were ""inaccurate and falsely place emphasis on this church."" The church also said it hadn't been informed any of its parishioners had died as reported by a local newspaper. 
Beilenson told the Sacramento Bee Thursday that church leaders had ""basically told us to leave them alone,"" adding ""this is extremely irresponsible and dangerous for the community.""
Health Department spokeswoman Janna Haynes told CNN officials they believe the virus is being spread during Bible study and fellowship meetings in small groups at congregants' homes. Haynes says the department is very concerned about the upcoming holidays of Palm Sunday and Easter, when church members and their families traditionally get together to celebrate, and they are deploying translators to plead with the Russian speaking community to stay home.
In its statement, the church said it had complied with all federal, state and local guidelines and regulations by closing its doors on March 18 and directing members to remain at home. 
""The church did not rebuff or decline communications from the health officials as reported,"" according to the statement.
The statement said church leaders hadn't ""at any time respond (ed) 'leave us alone'"" and disputed church members had continued to gather in people's homes.
In response to the church's statement, the health department released a statement Friday that said health officials had spoken to members of the church and community during their contact tracing investigation, and those interviews revealed links between the cases linked to the church.
""While we know that the church as a whole has ceased to meet and the leadership is hosting online services, we have been told by multiple sources that there are groups that continue to meet in homes, despite the public health order to not gather with anyone outside of household members,"" the health department statement said. ""These gatherings have been directly linked to the clusters of cases in the community. 
The statement said the department's only goal is make sure people comply with the public health order not to gather to prevent the spread of the virus. The statement also noted that ""in no way does Sacramento County condone ridicule, hatred or violence toward this church."" 
""It's a touchy subject. A lot of (people) believe they will be divinely protected, that God is stronger than the virus,"" said Vlad Kirgiz, the editor of The Evening Sacramento, a Russian language news blog.
Kirgiz said that despite dire warnings about the dangers of gatherings, there is a strong cultural tradition of not trusting the government. 
Kirgiz told CNN that when he excerpted part of local newspaper story about the Covid-19 cluster, he ""received a tsunami of negative comments blaming our news blog for participating in the attack on the church and even on our own community. We had to turn off comments to avoid the conflict and further emotional escalation within our community that already seems to be on the edge."""

There’s no cut-and-dry criteria for what reaches the level of pandemic and what does not, and there is no threshold of cases or deaths that triggers the definition. Generally, though, it says more about a disease’s spread than its severity. The WHO classified the novel coronavirus as a global public health emergency on January 30. Until now, they’ve been reluctant to call the outbreak a pandemic until this point over concerns that it would incite unnecessary panic, though they’d been warning countries to prepare for a pandemic. “Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,” Tedros Adhanom, director general of the WHO, said at a press briefing at the end of February. “What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways.” Countries around the world, including in the US, have already been leaning on pandemic preparedness plans to respond to outbreaks of the new coronavirus. The last time the WHO declared a pandemic was during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, which infected nearly a quarter of the world’s population. However, that decision was criticized for creating unnecessary panic. SARS was not considered pandemic, despite affecting people in 26 countries, and neither was MERS. Developing..."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Microsoft is planning to make all of its internal and external events digital-only until July 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The software maker had already revealed Build 2020, due to be held in Seattle in May, would transform into a digital event. This digital-only focus is now extending to far more events over the next year. 
In light of the challenges presented by COVID-19, Microsoft has been closely monitoring the developing global situation and re-assessing the overall company-wide in-person event strategy, explains a recent email to Microsoft MVPs. As a company, Microsoft has made the decision to transition all external and internal events to a digital-first experience through July 2021.
Lots of Microsoft events will be impacted over the next year
This means Microsoft Ignite will be held as a digital event in September this year, and Microsofts presence at Computex 2020, which has been optimistically rescheduled to September, wont involve an in-person event. It will also impact any plans Microsoft had for CES 2021, and the companys Build 2021 event. Build is typically held in April or May, which would mean next years event will also be digital-only.
Microsoft also canceled its in-person Inspire event for partners that was due to be held in July. The company is still working out whether this will also become a digital event or not. ZDNet reports that Build typically has around 5,000 attendees, inspire as many as 40,000, and Ignite around 25,000, so the impact of the decision is significant. Dont expect to see any in-person Surface hardware events this year, either.
Microsoft will now be relying on its own digital events team and increasingly Microsoft Teams to allow the company to hold events like Build 2020 remotely while the majority of employees are still sheltering at home."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Following in the footsteps of Netflix and YouTube, Amazon has announced that it will also reduce streaming quality in order to lessen the strain being put on broadband networks. 
We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to Covid-19, a spokesperson told The Guardian. Prime Video is working with local authorities and internet service providers where needed to help mitigate any network congestion. 
Unlike Netflix and YouTube, Amazons statement suggests that it will reduce stream speeds in various territories where Amazon Prime Video operates, not just Europe. The Verge has reached out to the company for more information. Amazon Prime has more than 150 million subscribers around the world, and Prime Video is available in more than 200 countries. Amazons spokesperson told The Guardian that this includes Europe, where weve already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience for our customers. 
Broadband strain will continue to be a concern as more people are required to stay at home to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Nielsen is estimating that people staying home can lead to almost a 60 percent increase in the amount of content we watch in some cases and potentially more depending on the reasons. That means streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, other video platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and online gaming will all affect broadband speeds. Thats on top of the strain that comes from people working from home and students using video conferencing tools like Zoom to participate in online classes."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Verizon is launching a new tool to help customers troubleshoot issues remotely, the company announced on Monday. The tool should allow Verizon to support customers without requiring a field technician to step inside their home. Verizon told The Verge it was piloting a virtual assistant tech tool last week, and now its sharing more information about it.
This new tool gives us the ability to provide the excellent service our customers deserve while keeping them and our technicians safe in these unprecedented times, said Kyle Malady, Verizons chief technology officer, in a statement.
The tool is intended to help with in-home service calls
The tool is intended to be used for service calls that need to be completed in your home, such as troubleshooting your router. To use it, Verizon will send you a text with a link, and youll have to tap that to open the tool in a web browser. From there, youll be able to share pictures or live video with a Verizon technician who will remain outside your house during the call so they can see the issue youre trying to fix and give you recommendations. The Verizon technician can even draw or circle things on the images you send to suggest ways to fix the problem. 
The tool is made by a company called TechSee, which provides a similar service for Vodafone, and you can see how that works in this promotional video:
Verizon says it will still be dispatching technicians for needed repairs that take place outside, but it told The Vergelast week that its making every attempt to perform work without going inside homes or small businesses to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. As part of those efforts, it has been canceling scheduled appointments for internet installation and repairs, though self-install options are available for qualified service orders."

Now companies are closing down their offices and asking employees to work from home. If you have been affected, chances are most of your in-person meetings have been changed to conference calls.
Working from home might sound great at first, but having to do all your own IT work can be a hassle. After all, the last thing you want is to have a technical issue right when its time to dial in; theres no one to help troubleshoot your connection, and it can really get in the way of a productive afternoon.
Make sure everything is right before the call begins. Here's how to prepare for video conference calls from home, or wherever you might be working from.
Be Aware of Your Surroundings
If you need to appear on camera during your call, make sure you know what's going on around you. Close that window if you're on a noisy street and flip on a light.  PCMag's lead camera analyst Jim Fisher stresses that Soft fill on your face is all that matters. Using a desk lamp with a shade should work, as long as you can avoid harsh, direct light. If youve got big windows, face the windows so they light you up; otherwise the camera is going to struggle with exposure.  
Get Creative With How You Connect
Most companies have a favorite service they use, like Skype, Google Hangouts, or Zoom. If youre working on a personal computer, all you have to do is download the appropriate desktop app or click a link and log into your account. 
However, if you have to think fast and find the right video call service that fits your needs, remember that most mobile messaging apps have video capabilities. Apps like Facebook Messenger, Signal, Android Messages, and Google Hangouts, among others, allow for limited video calling. Many of these services also have web and desktop apps. FaceTime also allows group chats and supports receiving phone calls on your computer.
Clear Out the Bandwidth Hogs
One of the downsides of video chats are the pixelated screens and choppy audio that comes with lackluster bandwidth. If youre expecting a video call or three, make sure the smart devices in your home aren't hogging the connection.
If the kids are streaming video games or Disney+, the robot vacuum is mapping your home, or hefty software programs are running on your PC, all that activity could disrupt your video call at an inopportune time. 
To start, check your internet speed to know what you're working with and whether youre getting what you pay for. If youre worried about someone else using up your connections resources, here's how to see if someone is stealing your Wi-Fi. 
Log In Early
Dont wait for the meeting to start to find out your connection is bad or your software doesnt work properly; test it before the conference starts. You can do this in Zoom by using the programs test feature. WebEx also has a Personal Room that can be used for testing.   
In Skype, click your profile picture and select Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video Settings, and there should be a camera preview under the Video section. You can also look for Sound Test Service in your Skype contacts to test audio quality.
If Wi-Fi is still giving you trouble, fish out that dusty Ethernet cable for a direct connection, which should hopefully cut down on any potential speed issues or sudden dropouts while video conferencing. If your laptop doesn't have an Ethernet port, pick up a cheap USB to Ethernet or Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter.
Avoid Feedback
Don't rely on your computers iffy built-in microphone and speakers. Find yourself a nice Bluetooth headset or even gaming headphones to use when youre on a call. They connect easily to your computer while also offering comfortable over-ear fits with a strong microphone.
Dont Forget a Charger
Long conference calls can drain a laptop battery pretty quick. And you don't want to have to step away from the meeting to find your charger as battery warnings blink on your screen. Make sure your laptop is plugged in and powering up.  There are also some portable chargers powerful enough to recharge your laptop in a pinch. Our Editors' Choice is the iMuto Portable Charger X6 Pro, which has a 30,000mAh capacity in a 1.5-pound body.
Have a Backup Plan
No matter what program you use, have a backup plan in case something goes awry, whether that's switching to an audio-only call or throwing in the towel and realizing you're in a meeting that could've been an email.

On Tuesday morning, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah attempted to follow the lead of all the quarantined people in Italy who've been flocking to their balconies to make music together and pass the time, but he didn't manage to create a heartwarming moment like they've been having in Italy.
Italy has been put on total lockdown in an attempt to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, which results in the respiratory disease COVID-19. So to entertain themselves and foster a sense of community, many residents have started singing, dancing, and playing instruments out on their balconies.
Inspired by Italy's response to the coronavirus isolation, Noah went out on a balcony and started to sing ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin, Disney's 1992 animated movie. Before he could finish his song, however, a man can be heard furiously screaming, ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""
A discouraged Noah walked back inside and tweeted, ""Nothing can break the human spirit. Except that guy. That kinda hurt."" Though it's unclear if the video was real or staged, there's no denying it has extremely believable New York Energy.
While things didn't go smoothly on Noah's first attempt to bring the city together through song, he vowed he'll try again tomorrow. Don't let the haters get you down, dude."

The change is likely due to the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus outbreak, which is the reason behind the closures. As the number of cases rise in the U.S. and throughout Europe, local authorities are implementing stricter and stricter measures by the day, which in some areas mean closures of non-essential retail stores. And while some of the measures are temporary, in reality no one can say when the outbreak will be contained to a degree when it's safe to go back to normal again.

I know countless others are desperate for an answer to this question. We're waiting for Congress to pass a stimulus package that might save us from the worst recession America has seen in decades. We're wondering when tests, masks, and ventilators will arrive at hospitals, so we might be a little less fearful of COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus. 
Panic and anxiety threaten to overwhelm us and our body politic. As the map showing the spread of COVID-19 turns redder and redder, it might be easy to focus only on what helps your family and loved ones survive this nightmare. Paid leave for your spouse or partner but no one who works at a company with more than 500 employees? Ugh but OK. A billion-dollar slush fund for ""distressed"" industries but few protections that would keep workers from getting laid off? Not cool, but if it keeps the economy afloat, fine. 
Our lives would indeed be far more convenient if we could distance ourselves from the complexity of solving the coronavirus problem. But now is a time for reflection. The world we live in once we emerge from the pandemic, in months or even years, must look radically different from the one we inhabit now. Every solution must consider the most vulnerable among us and be built with equality and equity in mind, not just expediency. 
Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.
 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 21, 2020
If we cannot, for example, account for how incarcerated people, undocumented immigrants, and people experiencing homelessness will get tested and receive treatment, our efforts to ""flatten the curve"" will be in vain. The same will be true if the rich and famous can easily get tests while average sick people have to wait on hold or in long lines, arguing with bureaucrats and administrators about their potential exposure. 
If federal, state, and local measures to stave off a long, painful recession offer little relief for small businesses led by women and people of color, we will leave them behind with disastrous effects. Should we ultimately neglect to redesign the health care system so that every American has access to quality, free or affordable health care, we'll lose a critical opportunity to ensure a pandemic like this never happens again.

""There is a moral imperative that we are all in this together,"" says Sandro Galea, a physician, epidemiologist, and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. ""It is no longer good enough to say my health is separate from your health. If any of us are sick, we are all sick."" 
""It is no longer good enough to say my health is separate from your health. If any of us are sick, we are all sick."" 
Galea is co-chairing an emergency task force on coronavirus and equity. The group, which is based in Massachusetts, argues that the outbreak of COVID-19 isn't impacting the state's residents equally: The most marginalized communities are being hit hardest by the disease and economic fallout. 
The group's initial demands of the governor and legislature are four-fold: ensure safe access to testing and treatment for immigrants who may fear deportation if they seek medical care; guarantee safe quarantine for everyone, particularly people living in homeless shelters, where it's difficult to practice social distancing; pass emergency paid sick time for everyone; and, enact a moratorium on all evictions, foreclosures, and termination of public benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, and disability payments. 
Plenty of liberalactivists and politicians have made similar demands while sounding the alarm over responses to the pandemic that could concentrate more wealth and power in the hands of the few. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, along with other Democrats, are pushing Congress to tie corporate bailouts to worker protections, and proposing that the government cancel student loan debt to ease monthly costs for millions of people, increase Social Security and disability payments, and offer unemployment coverage to gig and part-time workers. 
The Senate needs to pass a stimulus that doesnt just go to no-strings-attached bailouts for giant corporations.

 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 23, 2020
In order to beat the catastrophic social and economic effects of coronavirus, we must find the political means and willpower to ensure that our response is an equitable one. As COVID-19 spreads, it exacerbates existing inequality, and the most vulnerable Americans our friends, family, neighbors will suffer the worst. 
""I dont feel like we have a lot of time to figure this out,"" says Galea. ""We are at a time when we need to mitigate the consequences for the most marginalized people now."" 
Galea says people who want to make that difference should contact their elected officials and urge them to support prevention efforts and relief measures that benefit and protect those most at risk.

He tweeted through it. 
Arizona congressman Gosar and Texas senator Ted Cruz both attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) about two weeks ago. A man who also attended tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease officially known as COVID-19. Both Gosar and Cruz had ""brief contact"" with the man, the Los Angeles Timesreports, and have self-quarantined in their homes to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. In severe cases, it can cause kidney failure, pneumonia, and death. Since the outbreak began, health officials have confirmed 110,029 cases of coronavirus infections. As of Monday, 213 of those have been in the United States, a number that continues to rise as municipalities struggle to contain the outbreak. 
In response, stores nationwide are selling out of face masks and hand sanitizer.
And despite being asymptomatic, Gosar is clearly feeling the panic. In a tweet on Monday, he wrote that he'd ""been thinking about life and mortality today."" 
""I'd rather die gloriously in battle than from a virus,"" Gosar tweeted, accompanying it with a dramatic image of knights at war. ""In a way it doesn't matter. But it kinda does."" 
OK, um. Well.

As one Twitter user pointed out, before being elected into the House of Representatives, Gosar was a dentist. He has never served in the armed forces. 
Within minutes, Gosar's tweet was turned into a copypasta, as other Twitter users mocked his melodramatic sentiments with some lighter images.

Naturally, the copypasta was added to another meme born from the coronavirus panic.

According to Netflix, the company is moving
 to reduce its video bitrates in Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic. The goal is to cut Netflixs bandwidth across the EU by around 25 percent to ensure internet traffic continues to run smoothly during this global outbreak.
With people around the world being urged to stay home, streaming services are expected to be a major source of entertainment for those practicing social distancing in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
The reduction in streaming quality in the EU is expected to last at least 30 days.
European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services Thierry Breton previously
 requested that Netflix help reduce strain on the EUs internet infrastructure. According to Breton, he spoke over the phone with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to share his concerns. He also urged consumers to switch from HD to standard definition to help alleviate possible internet issues.
Concerns regarding internet bandwidth issues are certainly well founded, especially when a mass number of users are streaming HD-quality Netflix content. The video streaming company alone consumes
 a whopping 15 percent of the worlds internet traffic, according to a study conducted in late 2018. And thats under normal circumstances when people are able to go about their lives and attend offline, outdoor activities.
As more people turn to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and other streaming services during this pandemic, it wouldnt be surprising to see a broader call to reduce stream quality to save bandwidth in other areas around the globe."

The dating app, which prides itself on being exclusive, is ""known for its selective admissions-based model and high achieving community of users,"" according to its press kit. The video chat feature, tested out by my Mashable colleague Brenda Stolyar, seemed odd at the time but now it seems like The League may have predicted how singles would connect during the coronavirus pandemic.
Seeing as people all around the world are being encouraged or forced to stay inside, dating has shifted into unprecedented territory. We should not stop dating under quarantine (if we don't want to), according to Match's chief dating expert Rachel DeAlto, but instead adapt. 
SEE ALSO: Don't despair about being single while social distancing. Here's why.
""I honestly do believe that it's an opportunity to slow down to get to know each other,"" DeAlto said in an interview with Mashable. She suggested phone calls and video chats as a way to connect.
Dating apps have started to capitalize on this, and are now offering video chat services. This week, The League announced new video dating features as well as two-week free memberships. By messaging ""#isoDate"" in the in-app Concierge, The League will provide the user with Member status for two weeks. The offer is valid as long as social distancing is encouraged. 
Image: the league
The membership grants users the ability to use League Live, a video speed-dating feature. Users go on three video call dates lasting two minutes each. Additionally, the app launched a video chat feature that allows calls without exchanging phone numbers. Users can also add 10-second videos to their profile.
The League is not the only app implementing these features. Plenty of Fish just announced a livestreaming feature, dubbed LIVE! Users in areas most impacted from the coronavirus like Washington, New York, and California can begin using it today, while it will be rolled out to over 80 percent of US users next week, and available to all global users by the end of April. 
Similarly to League Live!, Plenty of Fish users can play a game called NextDate that's akin to speed dating. Users can chat to potential matches for 90 seconds, then decide if they want to move to a one-on-one call. 
Image: plenty of fish
""I'm excited to offer this free feature to our members in the hopes it allows people to have fun and build meaningful relationships virtually, while face-to-face interaction is temporarily limited,"" said Plenty of Fish CEO c Green in a press release. 
At this point, we don't know when exactly social distancing will end; it could well take months. This means that dating apps need to retool their offers to fit our new dating landscape. People cannot just send a few messages and meet up in person anymore. While it's not certain, it will not be surprising if more apps follow The League and Plenty of Fish's lead.
""There is so much technology,"" said DeAlto, ""so whatever you are planning on doing... going for drinks or going for dinner, you can do all that virtually."" Apps should prepare for ""dating in the time of corona."" (Sorry.)"

Well, sort of. While Walmart, Best Buy, and Target are all completely sold out, Amazon still has a bunch of digital oral thermometers and a handful of those fancy infrared/""no-touch"" ones in stock as of March 20. (The only type of thermometer that *wasn't* widely available on the site the last time we checked was the traditional glass variety, but you probably don't want one of those, anyway they're super fragile.) 
The only catch is that most of the models Amazon's still got up for grabs aren't scheduled to ship until mid-April or May at the earliest, and some brands are dabbling in price-gouging
 given the current consumer demand. Such are the times we live in, unfortunately.

In addition to advising people to properly and frequently wash their hands and refrain from touching their faces, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also urged anyone who feels ill or exhibits coronavirus symptoms to stay home from work in hopes of preventing potentially deadly germs from spreading.
With more than 95,000 confirmed coronavirus cases around the world and more than 3,200 coronavirus-related deaths, Trump's comments which seemed to downplay the severity of the global situation were criticized to the extent that he felt the need to issue a tweet.
""I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. While it's true he didn't outright say that people with the coronavirus should go to work, he essentially implied that if you're exhibiting symptoms of the disease you don't have to take them seriously because there's a chance you'll heal on your own.
I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible &amp; successful effort being made!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2020
Trump also said that some people with symptoms go to work and ""get better"" but did not condemn that choice or echo the concerns of healthcare professionals and public officials. His comments come a day after he said he hadn't touched his face in weeks, which was clearly a lie.
FYI Trump didnt say people SHOULD go to work if they have Coronavirus. He said they DO go to work. 
Though it certainly sounded like he was endorsing the idea. 
In this case, its his carelessness with words thats the problem. And we cant afford carelessness right now.

As coronavirus cases continue to spread some companies are advising employees to work from home, and several have cancelled non-essential business travel, including pulling out of conferences and events such as SXSW.

It felt wrong.
I was washing my hands, as I've done approximately 50 times over the past two days, because I've now joined the masses of paranoid people worried about contracting the new coronavirus (which results in the disease that's been officially named COVID-19). As I was lathering up, I remembered that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised people to scrub for at least 20 seconds, which is about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice.
I decided to try the musical self-timing method and began singing ""Happy Birthday to You"" in my head while washing my hands. When it came time to insert the name of the person celebrating a birthday, however, I froze. Who was I supposed to be singing to?
SEE ALSO: 14 ways to greet someone that don't involve shaking hands
After a few seconds of blankly staring at myself in the mirror wondering why the CDC failed to tell people who to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to, I decided I had to pick a name. Any name. I naturally chose myself and started singing the song all over again. But upon hearing myself think words, ""Happy birthday dear Nicole,"" while standing alone in a bathroom two months before my actual birthday, I cringed.  
My next thought was that I should dedicate my hand washing song to someone else. ""Do I sing to like, John Krasinski?"" I wondered. But before I could restart the song a third time I realized that all of these setbacks had likely brought my hand washing time to more than 20 seconds, so I simply stopped washing and turned off the water. 
Ultimately, I wouldn't say my first run at singing while scrubbing my hands went well. I was left feeling confused and annoyed, and decided to ask the internet who they sang to during their own hand washing parties.
Honestly? To myself!
 Kally Lavoie (@MissKallyLavoie) March 6, 2020
It's clear that some people feel comfortable singing to themselves or simply humming the tune without thinking of any lyrics. But for anyone like myself unable to comfortably complete either of those tasks, here's what I suggest: If you don't personally know someone celebrating a birthday while you're washing your hands, sing to a celebrity.
There are a bunch of online resources for learning celebrity birthdays, and though these people will never know you're celebrating their day in a restroom while washing your hands, at least you'll be singing with purpose. When I wash my hands before lunch today, I'll be singing ""Happy Birthday"" to actress and activist Connie Britton, who turns 53 today. In addition to the Friday Night Lights star, Shaquille O'Neal was born on March 6, so I may dedicate my pre-dinner hand wash to him.
If you can't find a celebrity you feel like celebrating, you can always sing to Creed Bratton, like Michael Scott did during that one episode of The Office. And if you want to be extra cautious, you can tack on a few extra seconds to your wash by adding ""cha-cha-chas.""
Now that I have some clearer hand washing direction, I feel fully equipped to properly kill germs. My only remaining fear is that the song ""Happy Birthday"" can get pretty annoying after a while. So for those who grow tired of singing it, or simply refuse to ever sing it in the first place, here are some alternative 20-second tunes you can wash to instead.
Helpful Twitter threads, like this one from @JenMonnier, list several songs with catchy 20-second choruses from Beyoncé's ""Love On Top"" and Toto's ""Africa"" to Lizzo's ""Truth Hurts.""
You're supposed to wash your hands for 20 sec, which is the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. But I'm tired of singing Happy Birthday and you probably are too, so I've done the very important public service of compiling other songs with roughly 20 sec choruses to sing:
 Jen Monnier (@JenMonnier) March 2, 2020
People are sharing a slew of other ways to pass the 20 seconds it takes to submerge your hands in soap and water, too. And if all else fails, you can always sing the pizza bagel jingle. Or, you know, just count to 20.
Apparently, to minimise risk of coronavirus, you should wash hands for at least 20 secs, which is approximately how long it takes to sing Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.
Neither tune appeals to me, but Ive found that humming the Imperial March quite quickly works a treat. pic.twitter.com/uOwWCSzAik

 Maureen Beat (@artxltd) March 4, 2020
A Reddit post called ""Samples suspended until further notice!"" was shared by someone who claimed their mother-in-law is a sample server for Club Demonstration Services (CDS) at Costco in Santa Maria, California. Per the website, CDS is the ""in-house marketing provider to Costco"" known for using face-to-face interaction to engage and inform customers about products.
""Today [she] was told they will not be serving samples for the foreseeable future. Costco is allowing CDS workers to work at the warehouse in various other capacities until samples are resumed,"" the Reddit post continued.
An Instagram post from @costcodeals also claimed that another sample server from CDS confirmed that samples are suspended at the moment.
While the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that there's no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted through food, it's still a problem because customers have to interact with the people handing out the food. 
Coronaviruses are reportedly spread from person to person by close contact, respiratory droplets, or touching an infected surface. That's why washing your hands and refraining from touching your face are such important preventative measures, and it's also why free samples are being viewed as a bit of a risk.
Costco isn't the only grocery chain reevaluating its sample procedures. A recent Trader Joes memo to employees, which was viewed by Business Insider, reportedly calls for changes in the way free samples are handed out in stores. 
""Serve samples with a fork or spoon, so customers do not need to use their hands to eat the sample,"" the memo instructs.
While it's sad to see free samples go, with more than 101,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, it's clear why extra caution is being taken.

Britons are only permitted to leave their homes for food, health reasons, or work (if it's not possible to be done from home) in a bid to slow the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
Abortion services in the UK are under considerable strain as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Women with severe health issues who've been advised to self-isolate say they're being forced to choose between risking their health by leaving their house and continuing with an unwanted pregnancy that could imperil their health, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). 
A quarter of abortion clinics run by BPAS closed on Tuesday as a result of staff sickness and self-isolation, per a statement emailed to Mashable. BPAS sees 100,000 women per year for reproductive healthcare services. It estimates that at least 44,000 women will need access to abortion services over the next 13 weeks as the pandemic reaches its peak. 
Currently, those seeking abortion services will need to leave their homes and travel to a clinic. For those living in areas affected by clinic closures, BPAS warns that women might need to travel ""across the country for care and to mix in cramped NHS waiting rooms where distancing is impossible."" Earlier this week, the UK government published and later inexplicably retracted changes to abortion law permitting women to take both pills for early medical abortions in their own homes without needing to attend a clinic or hospital. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) initially published a new guidance, stating: ""The secretary of state for health and social care has approved two temporary measures in England to limit the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) and ensure continued access to early medical abortion services."" Five hours later, the published guidance permitting telemedicine for abortion was deleted. 
Telemedicine for abortion has been recommended by evidence-based bodies such as NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Under English law, women must take the first of two pills required for abortion in an abortion clinic. The second pill can be taken at home between 48 and 72 hours after the first pill was taken. In Scotland and Wales, women can take both pills at home. 
SEE ALSO: Abortion and same-sex marriage are now legal in Northern Ireland
Dr Jonathan Lord, medical director for Marie Stopes UK, said the organisation is ""horrified by the governments U-turn, which was made with no explanation or regard for the advice of clinical experts."" 
""Women are already bearing the brunt of this cruel, reckless, and irresponsible decision and being forced out of self-isolation to mix unnecessarily with others, endangering both their health and that of frontline NHS staff, at the same time as putting more pressure on a health service already stretched to the limit,"" said Lord. 
""We have already heard widespread reports across the NHS of women being unable to access services, leaving them extremely distressed at a time when they need care the most. If the regulations are not changed urgently, women may be left with no option but to seek care illegally and will be denied the standards of care they deserve.""
For women and girls who are immunocompromised, leaving their home to go to an abortion clinic presents a very real risk to their health. One woman told BPAS she is in a ""dire situation"" as she has an underlying health condition and needs to access abortion services. ""Im a high risk individual due to my previous medical history and asthma. This has left me in a dire situation and when the temporary measures came about [to enable telemedicine] I definitely saw light at the end of the tunnel,"" she told BPAS. ""Without provision of measures like this, I will either risk myself to COVID-19 while attempting to make my way to an appointment, have to resort to illegal practices outside of the healthcare system or keep the pregnancy for longer which is harmful both to me and the child as it grows and develops.""
Another woman told BPAS that her child has underlying health conditions and that travelling to an abortion clinic would endanger her child's health as well as her own. ""My daughter is at risk of life-threatening complications from this virus. We have been advised for some time to practice social distancing to minimise risk, it is unfair to be put in this type of position,"" she told BPAS. ""Given the severity of the situation and the current health advice there must be some type of provision for accessing the treatment without the need to physically attend the clinic.""
""Women are not getting the care they need""
Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, told Mashable we need clarity from the government at this moment of national crisis. ""With the NHS under increased pressure and social distancing a priority, it's time to do everything we can to ensure that women's reproductive rights are not undermined during this crisis,"" said Creasy. ""44,000 women will need access to abortion services in the next 13 weeks and we need to make sure they can do so during lockdown.
""We need women to be able to take both sets of early medical abortion medication at home so that they do not need to take an unnecessary journey during lockdown, putting further strain on the NHS,"" Creasy added, urging The Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock to change his mind on the matter. 
Ann Furedi, chief executive of BPAS, said in a statement that abortion services are already buckling and at risk of collapse.
""Women are not getting the care they need,"" Furedi said. ""The prime minister needs to listen and act on the scientific evidence. With the entire country shut down, why on earth are we forcing women who could safely be treated at home to travel considerable distances including women with severe health problems who have been told to self-isolate? It is absurd, its reckless and its easily fixed.""
Reproductive healthcare professionals are calling on Boris Johnson to intervene and allow women access to telemedicine for abortion. 
Dr Kate Guthrie, spokeswoman for Women on Web which helps women who want to buy the tablets online  said they are being contacted by women who cannot leave their homes due to the pandemic. ""They are desperate, and their emails are heartbreaking,"" said Guthrie. ""We call on the prime minister to do the right thing by women in the most desperate of circumstances and approve telemedical abortion services as a matter of urgency.""
Dr Jonathan Lord said he was concerned that the government, in backtracking on its decision, had moved away from acting on science and evidence.""We implore the government to act on science, evidence and expert clinical advice to limit the spread of COVID-19 as well as ensure continued access to abortion care, instead of reacting to extreme pressure groups who have a strong anti-woman agenda,"" he said in a statement. 
Access to reproductive services are being affected in other parts of the world due to the coronavirus outbreak. In the U.S. the states of Ohio and Texas have categorised abortions among non-essential surgical procedures that are being temporarily delayed due to coronavirus, thus limiting access to reproductive healthcare. 
Mashable reached out to the DHSC for clarity but did not hear back immediately."

And it's unlikely that the weeks and months to come will bring an end to both the pandemic, and the difficulties faced by students navigating a dramatically different campus (and world).  
Amid all the problems exacerbated by school closures, mental health support for LGBTQ students remains crucial, but potentially harder to access, according to experts consulted by Mashable. 
Everyone's mental health should be a priority right now: The isolation necessary to flatten the curve, the process in which protective measures are taken in order to ensure the number of cases doesn't overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system, takes a psychic toll on those obeying mandated social distancing as well as those in states with stay-at-home orders, a toll that may last after the pandemic gets under control. 
For LGBTQ youth, there are increased risks associated with campus closures and the isolation that comes with it, which can cut them off from key mental health resources, according to Dr. Tia Dole, the chief clinical operations officer at the Trevor Project, a LGBTQ crisis intervention support network. 
In addition to lacking the support provided by peers and campus LGBTQ centers, some students, if they attend school away from home, might be returning to unwelcoming home environments. This can have a disastrous impact on mental health: According to recent research from the Trevor Project, over 25 percent of LGBTQ youth who lacked an accepting adult in their life reported attempting suicide in the previous year. LGBTQ youth who did have at least one accepting adult in their life were 40 percent less likely to report a suicide attempt in the previous year. Additionally, Dole notes that many students first embrace their LGBTQ identity in college, whether by finally getting others to use their proper pronouns or by first sharing this identity with others. As such, returning home on such short notice and being physically cut off from the campus community can halt a natural developmental process where young people form their identities within a supportive community. 
COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, is already impacting the way LGBTQ youth engage with mental health resources: A Trevor Project representative told Mashable via email that nearly 20 percent of its crisis contacts from LGBTQ youth in the last week have mentioned COVID-19. 
Mashable talked to Dr. Dole, and Ellen Kahn, the senior director of programs and partnerships at LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign to get insight on how to give LGBTQ college students the mental health support they need right now. We also spoke with Grant Gebetsbergerand Marley Hillman, two students at Tufts University, to determine what worked best for them and the LGBTQ community at their school. They organized a mutual aid system on their campus as it shut down in order to help connect students to housing, food, storage, and transportation. They then faced their own mental health struggles when they had to leave. For everyone engaging with LGBTQ college students today, here's how they recommended helping out. 
Fellow LGBTQ students 
If you're currently socially distancing, you've probably already noticed one thing: It can be incredibly isolating. Some LGBTQ students with closed campuses might be feeling this isolation on two additional fronts, Kahn notes. Students returning home to unsupportive households can feel socially isolated within their family unit, while students who stayed on or near campus and are now alone, can feel isolated from their family, friends, and school community. 
On top of that, HRC notes that some students might not have anywhere to turn. Their only alternative housing might be a potentially unsafe or abusive home. Or they could be facing job loss, which exacerbates housing insecurity for an already vulnerable population. The organization provided resources for students in this situation in a Twitter thread. HRC recommends talking with your student affairs department to arrange temporary housing, which some colleges are allowing on a case-by-case basis, as well as looking to your local LGBTQ center for other resources and housing support. 
For all LGBTQ youth facing compounded mental health struggles right now, Dole, Kahn, Gebetsberger, and Hillman stressed a similar message: Make sure you're still maintaining a sense of community that you found while on campus with others. 
To that end, Dole and Kahn suggest moving your on-campus support systems online. Dole recommends that campus LGBTQ centers hold Google hangouts, group phone calls, and Zoom meetings, and that students connect with their friends regularly through video and phone calls.
Hillman and Gebetsberger, the Tufts students, have found these efforts effective. 
""I think one thing that has been really heartening is that everybody has been virtually checking on each other,"" Hillman said. ""It shows the strength and importance of community care."" 
Gebetsberger says calling friends on FaceTime or sending Snapchats at particularly mundane times, like when eating lunch, has really helped him retain a sense of normalcy. It feels like casually hanging out with friends at school, he explains. And, of course, there are always memes. 
""Meme pages that I'm in have been blowing up,"" Gebetsberger said. ""It really helps to laugh."" 
For all the support that LGBTQ students might be giving to each other through sharing memes and sending Snapchats, Kahn, Dole, Gebetsberger, and Hillman also encourage students to take some time to focus on their own wellbeing as well, arguing that this can matter just as much as helping others. 
Dole points out that LGBTQ students used to community reliance, and aware of the mental health burden caused by the pandemic, might be tempted to overextend themselves while offering mental health support to their friends and peers. 
Instead of doing this, she encourages students to find a healthy balance that works for them. 
""Make sure that you're setting appropriate boundaries with your friends,"" Dole said. ""Don't overextend yourself. It's okay to say that you don't have the bandwidth for something. Do things for yourself: Find even 20 minutes to not be online. Take a walk outside. You need space to center yourself."" 
Parents 
No matter what your relationship was like with your LGBTQ teen when they were still in the house, Kahn and Dole stress that this can be a beneficial time to bolster your kid's mental health by engaging in thoughtful discussions about their past experiences (and current needs). 
When Gebetsberger returned to his native Ohio, where he has a supportive family and plenty of happy memories, he still found his mental health plunging. It was unclear how long he would be away from the community he had found both at school, where he had lots of queer friends, and during summers spent doing internships in Washington, D.C., where he enjoyed LGBTQ nightlife.
In Kahn and Dole's experience, this is hardly a rare occurrence. LGBTQ students returning home, whether to hospitable families or not, are going to be working through a host of personal issues, not only because of their identity but also simply because they were once adolescents in the homes they're returning to: For some students, like Gebetsberger, the last time they were in their family home for an extended period was back in high school. 
""That's a time when you're hyperaware of how your peers perceive you, and you look to your family for a sense of belonging and safety,"" Kahn said.  
Kahn and Dole encourage parents to intentionally reevaluate how welcoming their home was in the past, particularly parents of kids who first embraced their LGBTQ identity after going to college. Although you may not have previously known your child's sexual orientation or gender identity, now that you do, you're given an opportunity to be a resource and rethink how you've discussed LGBTQ issues in the past. They suggest working to un-learn some of the harmful lessons that may have been taught, wittingly or unwittingly, over the years. 
Kahn recommends taking stock of language specifically. She notes this is important to do even when you're not all stuck at home together while social distancing because ""your kids are listening from an early age to the way you talk about sexuality, gender, and LGBTQ people."" 
She suggests reflecting on potential past usage of phrases that establish straight and cisgender people as the norm, like, ""Someday your wife will say..."" Instead, think of more inclusive options to use, and discuss these options with your kids to see if they have insights or preferences.
Dole notes that, from a developmental process, a parent's relationship to their children will be changing as kids leave (and now return) home, so reflecting on the past can also open up new conversations. This can help give them new avenues to talk about their identity. 
""Take this time to rethink your relationships a bit,"" Dole said. ""We're all stuck inside together, and this is a great opportunity to change your behavior."" 
Dole suggests asking questions that reflect your changing relationship, like about what kind of emotional support your young adult needs now, particularly with respect to their identity and identity formation. 
Overall, working to ensure that your household is currently welcoming, regardless of past mistakes, can help the overall mental health of LGBTQ students returning home, Kahn and Dole said.

It might be tempting, Kahn notes, for allies to the LGBTQ community, whether within a school community or not, to instantly reach out directly to all the college-going LGBTQ folks they know, offering support. 
This is surely well-intentioned, but Kahn encourages allies to first equip themselves with proper mental health resources. She says it's important to understand what services are currently out there, and how they can be utilized in this era of social distancing. For general support, Kahn recommends resources like this one from HRC, which helps LGBTQ youth find direct online and phone support. 
Additionally, Dole points out that lots of therapy practices have moved online. School counseling might be available online or via phone as well, so a good first step is simply being aware of the changes to commonly accessed mental health resources like these. That said, it's important to note that rules for receiving mental health treatment on the phone or by video can vary depending on your insurance or where you live. As Mashable reported earlier this month, it's possible that Medicaid and private insurance may not reimburse this kind of treatment. 
Rather than directly sending resources to LGBTQ youth that you know, which might embarrass some students if you don't know them that well (and would not reach those who haven't revealed their sexual or gender identity to you), Kahn suggests posting about them on your own social media accounts. (If you're a professor, she notes you can include them in email blasts to students.) By doing so, you'll achieve two things: In the short term, you'll be connecting youth with helpful information; in the long term, you'll also be making clear (especially for those who have yet to share their sexual orientation or gender identity) that you're someone who can serve as a resource down the road. 
On top of that, methods for continuing your allyship that you already practice throughout the year will prove helpful now and when this current crisis eventually subsides.
A representative from the Trevor Project shared a few key tips with Mashable via email. First, just as you're presumably checking in with loved ones right now, the Trevor Project recommends checking in with LGBTQ friends and family year-round. In interactions with LGBTQ youth, the representative encourages practicing empathy, and listening without judgment, which can help to foster a safe and accepting environment wherever you are. Additionally, try sharing mental health and self-care resources specifically geared towards LGBTQ youth. And finally, if you know of any LGBTQ young person who feels hopeless or suicidal, you should connect them with the Trevor Project's crisis resources.
At this unprecedented time, making it clear that you're there for LGBTQ youth is crucial, due to the isolation and intense stress they might be feeling but Kahn wants everyone to understand that this should continue year-round. 
""You're making it clear you're a safe person,"" Kahn said. ""You can do that now, or at any point in their life."" 
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing suicidal thoughts, the TrevorLifeline provides free, confidential counseling. To reach a counselor, call 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678678. You can also talk to a crisis counselor at Crisis Text Line by testing HOME to 741741. Here is alistof international resources."

The New York state government announced a partnership with a handful of tech companies in a press release on Thursday. Most notably, Google Cloud infrastructure has been used to improve and reinforce the state's online unemployment benefits application page. It had to go offline for a couple hours on Thursday evening, but should now theoretically be able to handle a higher load than before.
Performance wasn't the only thing that got enhanced. The unemployment website also got the ability to save incomplete applications, in case a user needs to step away and come back later. It should also work better on a variety of devices like smartphones and tablets. Finally, the press release promised a streamlined experience with fewer questions to answer.
SEE ALSO: Those optimistic coronavirus numbers expect you to keep hardcore social distancing
To say New York's previous unemployment infrastructure wasn't up to the task would be a massive understatement. Hundreds of thousands of freshly let go New Yorkers have tried to apply for unemployment in the past few weeks, but many applicants experienced system crashes that left them empty-handed. 
Though the Empire State has been by far the hardest hit by the pandemic, the entire country has seen a surge of unemployment claims that have put enormous pressure on the systems in place to handle them. There were 6.6 million unemployment claims filed nationwide last week alone. 
Google isn't the only company partnering with New York in this endeavor. Deloitte is opening a large-scale call center, while Verizon is helping increase the Department of Labor call center's capacity. Of course, Google also launched a dedicated coronavirus help site in late March, though it didn't exactly do what the president said it would do."

Still, the U.S. president evidently thinks the media should be more complimentary of his alleged efforts.

""But yeah, next time we can bring out a cake that says 'Congratulations on only 17 million unemployed.' Seriously we could, because in the last month or so we've all gotten pretty good at baking.""
Millions are confined to their homes due to the pandemic, doing what they can to slow the spread and stave off cabin fever. Still, it's better than being outside right now. As of today, the U.S. has confirmed over 524,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 20,000 deaths the highest number in the world. That's almost 358,000 more cases and 3,500 more deaths than Spain, the next most infected country."

Then, she was paid a little visit.

On Tuesday, Facebook's chat app WhatsApp announced it will start limiting the way viral messages can spread on its network.
WhatsApp already marks messages that were forwarded many times with a double arrow, so that the recipient can tell the message did not originate from a close contact. Now, WhatsApp will limit these messages so that they can only be forwarded to one chat at a time. 
""Weve seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. We believe its important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation,"" the company said in a blog post.

WhatsApp also says it's working with the World Health Organization and over 20 national health ministries to make sure its users have access to accurate information. 
WhatsApp first started limiting viral content in January 2019, when it limited the number of chats where a forwarded message can be shared to five, down from 256. The company says that the move led to a 25 percent decrease in message forwards globally, but it helped keep conversations on the platform ""intimate.""

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, people are uploading helpful videos on YouTube to show everyone how to make their own masks at home. Whether you're showing COVID-19 symptoms or not, you could be infected with the virus and be spreading it to others without knowing. That's where the masks come in. Covering your face can help slow the spread of the virus by protecting people around you from breathing in your germs. 
While you can still buy masks online, it's also quite easy to craft your own basic version. We've compiled the best videos to help you make a mask at home and slow the spread of this deadly virus.
Put your bandanas to use
This video shows you how to make a mask with just a bandana and two hair ties. By folding up the bandana properly, you can make a face covering that fits snuggly over your mouth and nose and keep it up with two hair ties that wrap around your ears.
The CDC-approved version
The CDC's video, starring U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, takes a similar approach but shows how you can use a towel or part of a T-shirt with two rubber bands to make a competent face mask. It takes under a minute to achieve.
A more advanced mask
This tutorial from JOANN Fabric and Craft is a much more involved process and requires some materials that many people don't have readily available in their homes, but it sure makes a nice-looking mask if you can find everything you need. Their process involves elastic straps, ironing, and some light sewing to make a comfortable face covering.
The most comfortable mask 
If you're really feeling creative and have the right materials, this tutorial will show you how to create a fitted face mask with a printable pattern. If you have a sewing machine, plenty of materials (including some wire), and lots of time, this will probably give you the most comfortable face mask possible from home.
Play it safe
No matter which option you choose, keep in mind that the masks you can make at home are not on the same level as medical-grade surgical masks or N-95 respirators. But cloth masks will help you to not spread your germs around to other people in public places. By making a mask at home instead of buying a medical mask, you'll free up those more effective masks for medical professionals who are putting their own health at risk to help people who are most affected by the coronavirus.
And just because you have a mask doesn't mean you don't have to worry about social distancing. For everyone's safety, stay home whenever possible and make sure you maintain a six-foot distance from people you see out in the world."

Captain Tom Moore, a 99-year-old veteran, has raised £14 million ($17.3 million) for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) by completing 100 laps around his back garden. 
Ahead of his 100th birthday, the World War Two veteran decided he'd mark that rather significant milestone with a fundraiser for healthcare workers facing the coronavirus pandemic.
Moore originally aimed to raise £1,000 for NHS Charities Together, the collection of charities supporting staff and volunteers caring for COVID-19 patients, by walking around his garden. Now, he's not only completed his 100th lap before his birthday, he also raised an incredible £14 million. 
Moore completed 10 laps per day of his garden in Bedfordshire, UK, so he could achieve his target of 100. His back garden is 25 metres in length. His 100th birthday falls at the end of April. On Thursday morning, ahead of schedule, Moore completed the final 25 lengths of his garden with a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment by his side.
According to the JustGiving fundraising page, Moore is from Keighley in Yorkshire, UK. He served in the eighth battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (DWR) at the beginning of the Second World War, and in 1940 he was selected for officer training. 
""He was later posted to 9DWR in India, and served and fought on the Arakan, went to Regiment to Sumatra after the Japanese surrender and returned to be Instructor at Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Bovington,"" reads Moore's bio on JustGiving. He now lives in Bedfordshire with his daughter and two grandchildren.

Videos of Moore's walks were posted on YouTube throughout his fundraising effort. 
The money will go to NHS Charities Together, a charity which is currently supporting frontline NHS staff and volunteers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Its intelligent recognition function ensures it won't unnecessarily flip on the wireless charger when you place something other than your phone on it.
UV-C is used to decontaminate surgical tools and hospital rooms, and has even been proven effective in destroying viruses and bacteria. So it's not just some novelty device that looks cool it actively does its part in kicking the gross stuff out of your life.
When was the last time you cleaned your phone, let alone sanitized it? Exactly. Get this 2-in-1 Wireless Charger and UV Sanitizer and fix that. Stat. It's usually $45, but you can slash 15% off and get it for $37.99 during this weekend sale."

Once the novelty of staying inside wears off, the social distancing lifestyle can start to feel a bit lonely, boring, and monotonous. If you're looking for a cheap, simple way to make your living space more exciting, we have a somewhat unconventional suggestion: Buy a new shower curtain.
I know you're probably thinking that buying a new shower curtain sounds even more dull than the idea of staying home for another month. But I'm not talking about a sensible, neutral shower curtain that you'd buy to tie your whole bathroom together. I'm suggesting you order a fun, colorful, wacky, patterned, perhaps even slightly chaotic shower curtain. 
A new shower curtain has the power to transform the look and feel of your entire bathroom, not to mention, glancing at it in the mirror when you're washing your hands 20 times a day can help cheer you up.
SEE ALSO: Who are you supposed to sing 'Happy Birthday' to when washing your hands?
I've always favored extremely tame shower curtains that seamlessly blend with surrounding bathroom decor, but after recently coming across a Wayfair ad for a few wacky-looking shower curtains I did a little research and stumbled into the weird and wonderful world of online shower curtain shopping. 
Was everyone aware of just how many shower curtains there are in this world? There are curtains with gorgeous flowers, colorful stripes, maps, tassels, animals, sports logos, travel scenes, and more printed onto them. If you can imagine it, it's on a shower curtain. And if not, you can personalize your own curtain with a favorite quote, photograph, or design.
The online shower curtain selection is honestly a bit overwhelming, so if you need some inspiration I suggest filtering search results by seeking out curtains that reflect your interests. Do you love the color orange? Are a you a huge fan of Star Wars? Are you obsessed with dogs, vinyl, or traveling? If so, you're in luck. The perfect shower curtain is out there for you.
After a few initial searches I was able to find these serious contenders for my own shower, but the possibilities are truly endless.

Wayfair, Amazon, Etsy, Redbubble, and more have delightful selections of shower curtains including both whimsically unhinged and tastefully simple options that I highly recommend browsing. But some custom curtains online can be a bit pricey, so remember that you can always search for discounts at stores like Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, or Marshalls and TJ Maxx when stores re-open. 
Most people don't usually change their shower curtains very often, but it sounds like a nice idea to have several options on-hand that you can swap out depending on your mood. They even sell festive shower curtains for the holidays that are hilariously extra. And if you really feel like an upgrade you can also shop for new shower curtain hooks and rings.
Just be sure to keep the height of your shower/tub in mind when shopping for your new shower curtain,  remember to buy a plastic liner if needed, and your bathroom glow-up will be good to go."

A new report from Reuters painted a potentially grim picture for those who rely on the bubbly nature of soda, seltzer, and beer to get through their socially distant routines. Beverage makers rely on carbon dioxide to get the fizz in their products, but that could be thwarted by, of all things, a lack of demand for gasoline.
SEE ALSO: Everyone's regretting their '2020 will be better' tweets now
According to Reuters, gas demand is down 30 percent in the U.S. as people have been encouraged or forced to stay inside. That has reduced the incentive for some plants to produce ethanol because it's tied to the gasoline industry. It turns out that ethanol producers like to capture and sell the CO2 that comes as a byproduct of ethanol production, but if they aren't making ethanol, they aren't making CO2, either.
Without the usual supply of CO2, brewers and other drink makers have to pay more for the gas that is available. While bigger manufacturers might be able to take the hit in the short term, smaller brewers could struggle to meet demand and suffer as a result. 
In the case of beer, at least, there are ways to carbonate the drink without using CO2. Beverage Factory has a good explanation of ""natural carbonation,"" an old-fashioned process popular with home brewers. It does apparently produce a different mouthfeel for the beer, but the more pertinent issue might be that it's much more time consuming than forcing carbonation with gas.
These are unprecedented times and there's no certainty about what the next day carries, much less what the coming weeks and months will bring. Maybe beer and soda production will suffer, but maybe other carbonation methods can be used to keep the supply lines running. All we know is that, if beer stops being readily available, it's about to be a problem."

For Donald Trump, this means everything on the orange sphere above his neck but below his white-blonde swoop of hair.
It feels silly to be describing what a face is in 2020, but it seems the president is confused. At a meeting on Wednesday, when discussing the highly contagious new coronavirus (which results in the disease that's been officially named COVID-19), with airline executives, Trump said, ""I havent touched my face in weeks. Been weeks. I miss it.""
To stop the spread of the new coronavirus, it's been suggested that people refrain from touching their faces, but going weeks without touching your own face seems nearly impossible, right?
If a general sense of doubt that Trump hadn't so much as scratched his nose or rested his head in his hands in literal wasn't enough to discredit his claim, there are photos that show the president clearly made contact between his hands and his face in recent days. In other words, Trump lied.

Germs are everywhere!
More than 90,000 cases of the highly contagious new coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, have been confirmed, and panicked people are stocking up on supplies like hand sanitizer and face masks.
By now, hopefully you know the importance of properly and frequently washing your hands, and have likely been told ad nauseam not to touch your face. But before you get too worried, it's worth noting that there are a bunch of myths associated with the virus as well. If you're still especially concerned about the spread of germs, there is another simple preventative measure you can take: Stop making unnecessary physical contact with others.
Next time you go in to shake an acquaintance's hand, kiss a pal on the cheek, or greet someone with a friendly hug, don't! Instead, try using one of these 14 greetings that don't require any touching. And remember, pandemic or no pandemic, some people simply don't like to be touched, so feel free to say no to a handshake or physical greeting at any point time.
1. Literally just say hello
Greetings don't have to involve physical contact. There's nothing wrong with verbally saying hello to someone and not taking things any further.Say hi and quickly present a follow up question, like ""how have you been?"" to keep the conversation going. No time for hugs here.
2. Touch feet
The hip new greeting to emerge out of coronavirus paranoia is a foot tap dubbed the ""Wuhan Shake."" Videos of the unique greeting taken in China and Iran have gone viral, and it honestly looks kind of cool.If you want to make things even more fun you can channel Beyoncé at 4:34 of the ""Get Me Bodied"" video and do a little foot dance.
3. Wave at the person
What happened to waving? Who decided waving is only OK when there's significant distance in between people? I say waving at a friend who's right in front of you is totally acceptable. Bring back the wave.
4. Do the live long and prosper sign
Andrew Yang, the former Democratic presidential candidate turned CNN political commentator isn't much of a germaphobe, but he recently suggested that perhaps we should come up with a personal greeting that doesn't involve physical contact. His thought? The Vulcan salute from Star Trek, a perfect way to say ""live long and prosper.""
I hate to say this - Im not much of a germophobe myself - but we might want to work on a personal greeting that doesnt involve physical contact. pic.twitter.com/GTCgTBZENX
 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) March 2, 2020
5. Make a peace sign
If all else fails, throw a peace sign in the air. It's not very exciting, but it'll get your message across in a pinch. (Note: Peace signs are better for goodbyes in my opinion.) 
6. Tip your hat
This one requires wearing a hat at all times so that if you ever run into anyone you can tip it. It's not the most convenient option, but it's nice to switch it up every once in a while.
7. Give a nod
A nice head nod in someone's general direction can be a cool way to greet. Maybe practice in the mirror a few times to really perfect your execution.
8. Do the Jim and Pam high five
One of the best television high fives of all time didn't involve touching, and that's the level of high five you should all aspire to. Remember when Jim and Pam air-fived from across the room on The Office? Absolute germ-free perfection. 
9. Mime a fist bump
Fist bumps are a classic and easy greeting, so if you're a fan, keep doing them... just don't follow through all the way. Go in for the bump, but pull away before you actually touch skin. Maybe ""blow it up"" to make things less awkward. Or more. Who knows.
10. Do a salute of some sort
Get creative with it! Make it your own! Though this Zach Woods GIF makes the opposite case, salutes don't have to be awkward.
11. Do some air kisses
Real cheek kisses might be too risky at a time like this, but those fancy, pretentious air kisses? Now's the time to break those babies out with friends close enough for such a gesture.
12. Say ""raincheck""
Once the coronavirus scare is over we can hopefully resume casual physical contact, so just take a raincheck on that handshake or overly personal greeting. Everyone will understand!
13. Send a GIF while standing in front of someone
If you really want to high five or shake a hand but don't want to touch, send them a GIF of the action instead. To be clear, this is a bit strange and has big ""texting I'm here instead of ringing the doorbell"" energy, but you do you.
14. Share a welcoming squirt of hand sanitizer
What better way to bond with someone than by offering them a friendly squirt of hand sanitizer? In 2020 hand sanitizer is the new gum. By that I mean everyone wants some, not that people eat it. Do not eat it.
Be safe out there, everyone. Good luck not touching."

CVS and Walgreens have warned they could run out of hand sanitizer if you visit a local store, you may find empty shelves and options on Amazon are limited and, in some cases, seemingly pretty expensive. 
But as some folks online have pointed out, it's possible to make your own hand sanitizer. There've been lots of posts about it as people grapple with gaining some semblance of control over the outbreak on COVID-19, the official name of the new coronavirus. 
Even Stephen Colbert's The Late Show had a joking segment about making hand sanitizer using the notoriously potent liquor Everclear.

 Kaitlyn Pratt (@Fox5Kaitlyn) March 3, 2020
But making your own hand sanitizer is possible and it's not really even that hard. Recipes typically call for combining rubbing alcohol and aloe vera gel in the right proportions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water, but has said that as long as a hand sanitizer is at least 60 percent alcohol it can be effective at killing germs. That's key: You've got to have enough alcohol in the mixture. 
Combine in a bowl:-cup rubbing alcohol (99% isopropyl alcohol)-cup aloe vera gel.Stir. Decant into a clean soap or pump bottle.
That's it, that's the recipe. Originates with a 2019 post by biomedical PhD @azareal: https://t.co/nmxCOfqojL
 Maryn McKenna (@marynmck) March 2, 2020
Dr. Philip Tierno, professor of microbiology and pathology at the New York University School of Medicine, told Mashable in a phone conversation that as long as your mixture was 60 percent alcohol or higher, it would get the job done. 
""As far as effectiveness, any alcohol over 60 percent or higher would kill the coronavirus,"" Tierno said. ""The coronavirus has an outer shell that makes it a bit easier to kill [vs. other 'naked' viruses].
But if you're going to make your own sanitizer, as CNN points out, it's really important you do it correctly.  
And, in case you were wondering, ""You dont need scents or perfumes,"" Tierno said. 
But better yet, wash your hands. Just make sure you do it correctly. The CDC recommends you wet your hands, lather soap in your hands (all over) for at least 20 seconds, then rinse and dry with clean towel. Washing your hands is typically considered the best option, since hand sanitizers might not work as well on visibly soiled or greasy hands.

Would Dwight have a safety drill prepared? Would Michael be in a fetal position under his desk? Would Creed be coughing hysterically? The possibilities are endless, but Twitter user @the_real_bnell tried to imagine what a coronavirus-themed episode of the show might look like.
The first tweet in the hilariously on-point ""The Office: Coronavirus"" thread now has more than 200,000 likes. It imagines Michael ignoring any ""work from home"" memo in favor of being with his work fam, Dwight claiming immunity to the virus, Angela donning a full-on hazmat suit, and Kevin casually saying he already has the virus.

Michael ignores the work from home memo because he thinks that everyone should be together at a time like this

SEE ALSO: John Krasinski couldn't stop laughing when filming this episode of 'The Office' with Steve Carell
The thread goes on to imagine Creed as ""Patient Zero,"" outlines Stanley using his remote work opportunity to go on vacation, and Andy heavily panicking after reading a WebMD page.
""The episode ends with Michael shopping alone at Costco on a Saturday. He's excited because he usually 'can't even get in the door,'"" the tweet concludes.
Creed is somehow Patient Zero

 Daniel Burnell (@the_real_bnell) March 10, 2020
@the_real_bnell then went on to share a link to a r/DunderMifflin post on Reddit, where you can see a bunch of other brilliant fan predictions about how characters would react in to the coronavirus.
One fan imagined a scenario in which Michael would ""insist that everyone comes into work"" amidst coronavirus fears, but after learning there have been thousands of coronavirus-related deaths around the world he'd quarantine himself in his office and refuse to leave. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam would to try convince Dwight that Jim had contracted COVID-19 as a prank.
Other fans thought that Meredith would drink the office's remaining hand sanitizer, Stanley would leave work after hearing a single cough, and if Oscar tried to escape quarantine through the ceiling Angela would ask him to save her cat. All very believable!
At the very least we know Michael's aware that it's ""polite"" to wash your hands, and Dwight once wished for a new plague, so maybe the gang would do alright. But I imagine the episode would be absolute chaos.
At the end of the day, the coronavirus is a serious matter, and you should be frequently washing your hands, refraining from touching your faces, and staying informed on updates and guidelines. But when you need a lighthearted break from all the coronavirus concern, we highly suggest thinking about The Office."

At any rate, having an air fryer in your arsenal of kitchen appliances can be extremely useful for two reasons: For one thing, they give foods that crispiness you so crave without leaving them drenched in oil. They also make cooking with frozen foods even more convenient, since there's no thawing required when you go the air-frying route.

On Wednesday night, Hanks posted a statement to Twitter that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease known officially as COVID-19. The two are in Australia doing pre-production for Baz Luhrmanns Elvis Presley film.
He wrote in his usual down-to-earth tone, ""Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.""
Hanks is, of course, just one of many to be confronting this diagnosis. So far the World Health Organization reports there are more than 118,000 cases worldwide, and more than 4,200 people have died from it. 
It is so far affecting people in 114 countries and was today officially declared a pandemic by the WHO. While the majority of people with the virus only experience mild symptoms, but for 15% of people the symptoms are severe. 
It seems fortunate for them that they were a country where tests for the virus were readily available. The situation in the U.S. is quite different, where delays in making tests available have been the source of much controversy.
As for the health of Hanks and Wilson, it seems so far that both of them are faring well. He wrote, ""The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

The Betoota Advocate tweeted a photo of Hanks holding a Cast Away-inspired volleyball on Thursday. In it, they claim that staff at Australia's Gold Coast University Hospital, where the two are being treated, rolled the ball into Hanks' quarantine room to keep him company.
What most people don't know, however, is that the Betoota Advocate is a satirical site, kind of like Australia's version of The Onion.
SEE ALSO: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson test positive for coronavirus
The widely shared tweet links out to an article that states, ""the thoughtful and overworked staff at the Gold Coast hospital have brought Hanks in a Wilson volleyball to keep him company for the duration of his stay.""
Again, because the Betoota Advocate publishes satire, that is not true. The image in the story was also Photoshopped. (It was taken from footage of a 2015 Rangers game at which Hanks was thrown the ball.)
Several trusted reporters and people with high follower counts on social media have shared the false story as though it were real, which unfortunately helps elevate the spread of misinformation. It's unclear if they knew if they were sharing satire. 
As the coronavirus continues to spark concern it's important to be aware of the myths surrounding the pandemic and be extra vigilant when reading related tweets."

Many of them contain useful tips: avoid the 24-7 news cycle, reframe negative thoughts, practice mindfulness, and connect with loved ones. 
These coping skills will undoubtedly help many weather coronavirus anxiety, particularly if everything else in their life is going well. 
But COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, is forcing people to isolate, distance, and quarantine themselves, all of which can exacerbate stress, anxiety, and sadness. For those already dealing with mental illness, financial and relationship strain, unreliable support from family and friends, and limited access to physical and mental health care, reminders about coping skills are stop-gaps that can't fix a larger problem: a broken system that often leaves people one emergency away from a mental health care crisis. 
Coronavirus anxiety is showing up at Crisis Text Line, where users of the free mental health support service are mentioning words like scared, terrified, overwhelmed, panicking, and paranoid to describe their feelings. One-third of the service's conversations are normally about anxiety; that increased to more than 40 percent in March. Volume for the online therapy service Talkspace has risen by 25 percent since mid-February. 
The helpline operated by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is seeing a similar trend and recently took a call from someone so alarmed by the impact of coronavirus on their income that they expressed suicidal thoughts. The nonprofit has since posted an 11-page document that outlines coronavirus information and resources, including where to get mental health help if you've been quarantined and how to access care without insurance or regular doctor. 
There's no question that people are seeking help, but the nation's mental health care system is woefully unprepared to meet that need. Of the 60 million people with mental health conditions, nearly half go without any treatment. In 2018, one in four Americans reported choosing between paying for mental health care and purchasing household essentials, according to a survey of 5,000 Americans, commissioned by the National Council for Behavioral Health and Cohen Veterans Network. People reported long waits to see therapists, high costs, and poor insurance coverage. 
Mental health care is inaccessible to millions of people who are left to suffer in silence or rely on a patchwork of free services.

SEE ALSO: Here are some ways to ease your coronavirus anxieties
Though helplines and pay-based telemental health services can make a life-saving difference right now, we need a much more aggressive response as coronavirus anxiety spikes. 
Joe Parks, a psychiatrist and medical director at the National Council for Behavioral Health, says many changes could happen through regulatory measures. 
The rules for delivering mental health treatment via phone or video, for example, vary significantly depending on who's paying and where the patient lives. Medicare, government insurance for seniors and people with disabilities, will only cover telemedicine in high-need areas, like rural locations experiencing a provider shortage. Medicaid, state-based insurance for low-income people, children, and others who qualify, may not reimburse telemental health treatment in certain states. And some private insurers may cover remote therapy while others don't. 
Parks says that the federal government should consider temporary changes to their own policies and encourage insurance companies to do the same so that patients can receive mental health care from afar. This solution could deliver treatment safely and efficiently at a time when neither patients or therapists will be eager to see each other. 
Similarly, federal regulations require face-to-face visits to prescribe medications often used to treat anxiety. But with coronavirus, the rules of self-isolating, socialdistancing, and quarantine mean a patient in severe distress might find it difficult to get a prescription that relieves their symptoms. Parks says that's another regulation the government could temporarily relax. 
Neil Leibowitz, a psychiatrist and chief medical officer of Talkspace, says insurers could accept out-of-network claims for all members. Even when insurance plans offer coverage for therapy, it's difficult to find therapists who accept those plans because of low reimbursement rates. As a result, patients end up paying out of pocket. They may delay appointments, particularly when facing economic uncertainty, or abandon the idea of starting therapy altogether. 
Leibowitz also suggests temporarily waiving interstate licensure requirements, which would allow therapists to give care across state lines. In other words, a New York resident who wants to take advantage of telemental health can only interact with a therapist licensed by the state of New York. Leibowitz says relaxing this rule would lower barriers to access, particularly for people in states where provider shortages are high.  
""If we have a huge surge today, were going to struggle."" 
""Were going to want as much as capacity as we can have,"" says Leibowitz. ""If we have a huge surge today, were going to struggle."" 
People who experience mental illness may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus, says Dawn Brown, director of NAMI's HelpLine. Smokers, who may use nicotine to cope with mental health conditions, are prone to worse COVID-19 outcomes. Mental illness is disproportionately experienced by people who are homeless, and that population is at greater risk of developing COVID-19 because they may live in close quarters and lack medical care. Incarcerated people, who also experience high rates of mental illness, are vulnerable thanks to a lack of resources to stop widespread infection. 
Efforts to prevent and treat coronavirus must take into account people's physical and mental health, particularly in high-risk groups where specialized treatment for mental illness is critical. 
Brown says the federal government should respond to coronavirus anxiety by making long-term, substantial investments in the country's mental health care system with the aim of lowering barriers to care and providing equitable access to all.
""My hope would be that this is a huge wake up call to America that we have serious deficiencies in our health and mental health systems,"" says Brown. ""It will shine a glaring spotlight on them as this thing evolves.""

FCC chairman Ajit Pai launched the ""Keep Americans Connected Pledge"" on Friday, per an FCC press release. The FCC asked telecoms to sign the pledge, which guarantees that services will not be shut off if bills aren't paid, any incurred late fees will be waived, and WiFi hotspots will be open to the public for the next 60 days. This is in explicit anticipation of people not being able to pay bills because they can't work due to COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus.
Just about every major telecom in the U.S. has apparently agreed to sign the pledge  including AlticeUSA, Cox, AT&amp;T, Comcast, and many more. (You can see the full list in the FCC's news release.) So, hopefully, nobody who uses those services will be unfairly charged or disconnected over the next two months. 
SEE ALSO: What the coronavirus has done to the porn industry so far
As the coronavirus outbreak spreads and causes a series of disruptions to the economic, educational, medical, and civic life of our country, it is imperative that Americans stay connected,"" Pai said in a statement. ""Broadband will enable them to communicate with their loved ones and doctors, telework, ensure their children can engage in remote learning, and importantly take part in the social distancing that will be so critical to limiting the spread of this novel coronavirus.""
Interestingly, Pai also wants ISPs to ""relax"" their data cap policies, per the announcement, even though that wasn't part of the pledge itself. Many ISPs in the U.S. impose artificial monthly limits on how much data customers can use. If you go over, you don't necessarily lose service, but you do have to pay extra.
So far, AT&amp;T is the biggest domino to fall in that regard. Motherboard reported on Thursday that AT&amp;T would suspend data cap overage fees during the pandemic. Mediacom also told Motherboard in a separate piece that it would give its customers some extra data for the month of March. Comcast doesn't appear to be suspending data cap fees right now, but it is offering internet to low-income families.
It's obviously a net good that ISPs are signing this pledge not to overcharge customers, but the detail about data caps is just one example of how all of this could be handled a little better by everyone involved. If there are any other helpful internet policy changes made in response to coronavirus, we'll let you know."

Some people will make it through the crisis thanks to telecommuting and paid leave, but many can't afford to stop working, even if that's what public health experts recommend. 
Domestic workers are among those who are most at-risk for contracting COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, and who are also unlikely to have access to paid time off. They're forced to make a difficult choice: stay home to prevent becoming ill while helping to ""flatten the curve,"" or report to a job that potentially puts themselves and their community in danger. 
That's why the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), an advocacy organization, launched an emergency relief fund to help support nannies, house cleaners, and in-home care workers during the pandemic. The NDWA hopes to raise $4 million to aid 10,000 workers. 
Financial support will be distributed through NDWA's Alia platform, which pools paid time off and insurance benefits for its members. NDWA expects to provide money for paid leave so that workers can care for themselves or loved ones. Funding will also provide house cleaners, who've reported trouble purchasing supplies , gain access to cleaning agents.

""Domestic workers are being forced to navigate this crisis alone and without a safety net,"" Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said in a statement.
""Donations to the Coronavirus Care Fund will provide emergency assistance to nannies, house cleaners, and home care workers who need help right now, giving them the stability they need to stay home and be a part of the solution to this crisis."" 
The NDWA said that many nannies have still been expected to work. House cleaners have reported numerous last-minute cancelations, with some saying their income has been halved. Home care aides, who often tend to elderly patients and those with chronic health conditions, continue to work despite their constant risk of exposure to coronavirus.  
""Our own health depends on the health of the person next to us, and the person next to them,"" said Poo. ""Times like these remind us how connected we all are. We believe people will appreciate the opportunity to show care for the people who care for us."""

Supercomputers owned by tech companies, the government, and research institutions are capable of running complex experiments much more quickly than a traditional computer, let alone a puny human brain. 
These things are physically huge, too: a supercomputer called Frontier, housed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, is set to be the world's most powerful supercomputer when it's completed in 2021. It will weigh over 1 million pounds and is the size of two basketball courts.

Researchers whose proposals are accepted by the consortium will get access to the computing power of 16 supercomputers located across the United States. 
Coronavirus research initiatives that use supercomputers are already underway. IBM shared that its Summit machine, which it calls ""the most powerful supercomputer on the planet,"" has been used to help researchers identify the molecular compounds that have the best chance of binding to, and therefore neutralizing, the spikes used by the coronavirus to infect healthy cells. 
""They were able to recommend the 77 promising small-molecule drug compounds that could now be experimentally tested,"" IBM's announcement of the initiative reads. ""This is the power of accelerating discovery through computation.""
Other consortium members include MIT and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a host of Department of Energy national laboratories (where many of the supercomputers are actually housed), and NASA and the National Science Foundation.
Even as the citizens of cities and countries stay at home to fight coronavirus, it's good to know the biggest brains in the world human and machine are on the case, too."

Famous tourist destinations in Italy and New York City are ghost towns right now as people have been told to stay indoors. This has led to an onslaught of viral posts claiming things like dolphins are swimming in the Venetian canals because humans are effectively MIA.
Amazing, right? It would be if it were true. The alleged Venice dolphins make up just one example of fake, viral posts centered around animals supposedly reclaiming nature in the absence of humans, as National Geographic pointed out. One tweet about the false phenomenon has close to 40,000 likes, for example. 
The only problem is that a quick trip to Snopes reveals the truth, which is much less exciting than what these viral posts would have you believe. Dolphins have, indeed, shown up in Italian canals, but not in Venice; instead, those dolphins were seen in Sardinia, nearly 500 miles away. More noteworthy is the fact that dolphins show up in Sardinia from time to time, with plenty of dolphin-themed boat trips offered to tourists and nearly three-year-old videos to prove it.

The same goes for claims that swans ""returned"" to Venice after some undefined absence. That's not a new occurrence, nor is the idea of elephants showing up in Chinese villages. These things have happened before coronavirus took hold on the global news cycle, and they'll happen again. Chinese news sources, for instance, have debunked the elephant post, per National Geographic.
While sharing seemingly harmless videos of dolphins under the belief that the pandemic brought them back to Venetian waterways isn't the same as sharing fake health information, you should still use an abundance of caution before hitting retweet. It's easy to find comfort in evidence that good things are happening in the midst of tragedy. We get it. That said, we all need to be more vigilant than usual.
A time of crisis like this can also be prime lying season for people who want attention. Twitter, in particular, makes it easy to embed a couple of photos, claim something that's not happening is happening, and watch tens of thousands of people validate you for it. Everyone on Twitter has fallen prey to this at some point because retweeting is faster and easier than googling something. 
Please just exercise some caution before spreading things that feel unreal. If something seems unbelievable, try and figure out if it's true before sharing it. The last thing we need while tens of thousands of people are dying and millions more are isolated is to propagate the idea that their absence is a net positive."

In the single day since Animal Crossing: New Horizons released on Friday, it's done the world a great public service by not only making social distancing more manageable for players, but also cleansing our timelines with wholesomeness. Even if you don't play, all are invited to enjoy the healthy break from pandemic panic with the occasional drop of pure, mundane, slightly baffling joy.
The feature allowing players to visit their friends' islands has also been a perfect antidote to social-distancing loneliness.
Can't sleep at night due to anxiety related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus? No problem. Just invite hoards of your friends over in the game at 11:55 p.m. to reign utter chaos onto your humble abode.
Couples are even finding ways to go on virtual dates, since IRL dates have been strictly postponed until further notice.
There's a bit of dark humor, because in the face of a public health crisis, laughter is the best medicine. (Editor's Note: A vaccine and social distancing are, in fact, the best medicine but we'll allow this.)
Some are adding a little edge to the wholesomeness, since we wouldn't be adults playing a kids video game if we didn't do our damndest to make its PG content illicit. (Author's Note: I named my island Tiddy City lol).
So folks, in conclusion, Tom Nook is our savior, Animal Crossing is heaven, and also don't feel bad about finding much-needed morale-boosting distractions. Both you and your timeline deserve it."

To mark Safer Internet Day earlier this year, Snapchat had revealed the upcoming feature intended to direct users to mental health resources when needed.
""Here For You, which will roll out in the coming months, will show safety resources from local experts when Snapchatters search for certain topics, including those related to anxiety, depression, stress, grief, suicidal thoughts, and bullying,"" the company wrote in a February blog post.
The world already wasn't in the best state a month ago, but things have since taken a dramatic turn south and everyone's mental health has been impacted as a result. The possibility that our communal coronavirus nightmare could drag on for another 18 months won't have helped, either.
Therefore, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Snapchat announced on Thursday that it has pushed out Here For You earlier than its originally intended April launch date. 
Here For You has also been expanded to surface mental health resources when users search Snapchat for terms such as ""coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19."" Currently the only Here For You result for these search terms is the generic Here For You Snapchat profile, but this will soon change.
""In addition, we are building out a customized search section of Here For You related to coronavirus that will provide Snapchatters from the Ad Council, World Health Organization, the CDC, Crisis Text Line, NHS and other partners who are creating content on anxiety specifically related to coronavirus,"" a Snap spokesperson said in an email to Mashable. ""We expect this section to start rolling out to Snapchatters next week.""
SEE ALSO: Want to share viral coronavirus content? Consider these expert tips first.
Considering the amount of misinformation and fear circulating due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, any efforts to set the record straight or help people manage their anxiety  are welcome.
However, despite the addition of ""coronavirus"" to Here For You's key search terms, there remains a significant gap in the feature. According to Mashable's testing, Here for You does not appear when searching Snapchat for terms related to eating disorders, including ""anorexia,"" ""bulimia,"" ""thinspiration,"" ""thinspo,"" and ""pro ana.""
This is a notable oversight, particularly considering the criticism Snapchat has previously received concerning its relationship to body image. In December 2019, researchers found adolescents who use image-heavy social media platforms such as Snapchat are more prone to disordered eating than children on other platforms. 
""Social media seems to encourage young people to focus strongly on their appearance and the way it is judged or perceived by others,"" said Dr. Simon Wilksch, a Senior Research Fellow in Psychology at Australia's Flinders University.
Still, it's possible Here For You will add content addressing eating disorders at a later date, as the feature seems to have been rushed out the door. Mashable has reached out to Snap and will update if we hear back.
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing suicidal thoughts, text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. For international resources, this list is a good place to start.

At the time of writing, Italy has seen 24,747 total cases of the virus, a number which has doubled within the last five days. A total of 1,809 people have died.
As part of the lockdown, the Italian government has rolled out national restrictions on public gatherings, a form of social distancing which is our best weapon to fight the spread of the virus. Travel is also restricted, with only special circumstances allowed. People in Venice appear to be heeding these restrictions and staying indoors, transforming the buzzing tourist-populated city on the water into a picture of relative stillness.

Images of Venice's iconic canals in particular, usually afloat with its signature gondolas, heaped delivery boats, and other vessels, show a city withdrawn to the indoors. Usually a location dealing with overtourism, Venice has been described by the New York Times as ""ghastly empty.""
In fact, as CNN reports, the city's canal water has appeared more clear than usual, with people uploading photos to a Facebook group called Venezia Pulita
 (Clean Venice). But the Venice mayor's office told the news outlet that the water quality hasn't improved, rather that it ""now looks clearer because there is less traffic on the canals, allowing the sediment to stay at the bottom.""
Either way, it's weird to see one of Italy's biggest tourist destinations ground to a halt like much of the country.

But medical experts emphasize the procedure which is a common test for respiratory infections is absolutely normal. 
Though testing is still limited in places, if you have symptoms of COVID-19 the respiratory disease caused by this vigorously spreading coronavirus there's no reason to avoid the test. Testing is critical to help contain the spread of the contagious microbe. Called a ""nasopharyngeal swab,"" it requires a health professional to insert a cotton swab (like a long Q-tip, but thinner) through your nasal passage, reaching all the way to the back of your throat.
At worst, it's a bit uncomfortable.
""It is perfectly normal, maybe uncomfortable, but perfectly normal,"" said Mark Cameron, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University who helped contain the 2003 SARS outbreak. ""It's an uncomfortable test, but it's the gold standard of testing.""
""It's not scary,"" Cameron added, noting the same test is used to see if someone has strep throat.
""Its a little uncomfortable,"" agreed Dr. David Alland, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. ""It's on the level of getting your blood taken or getting a shot. It's on that order of anxiety.""
The deep nasopharyngeal swab is the standard, most reliable known test for the virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, to differentiate it from other types of coronavirus. ""It's the most logical place to test for SARS-CoV-2,"" said Alland. Later this year, other testing methods, such as swabbing different parts of the throat or nose, might prove just as effective, or not, he explained.
This virus infects our airways, so the long, thin swab reaches an area that is reliably infected, said Cameron. It's also an area with a lot of secretions (like from coughing), which reflects the virus growing in the lungs, he added. 
For those still uncomfortable with a test, the nurses taking swabs know what they're doing. 
""It actually is quite common and while unpleasant, not overly painful for most individuals,"" said Jessica L. Peck, a clinical professor of nursing at Baylor University. ""Nurses are well versed at making uncomfortable procedures tolerable.""
""It gets done and is over quickly,"" added Alland. 
Tests are a critical element of curbing the spread of the virus. They can identify infected people who need to isolate, as this coronavirus easily passes between individuals who are close together.  That's why the CDC recommends staying at least six feet from others.
""We do need to get everyone tested who needs to be tested,"" said Cameron.
SEE ALSO: You can't kill the coronavirus. That's OK.
That said, not everyone can easily get a test. The U.S. has been woefully slow in testing though testing is now ramping up. So if a doctor says you're a good candidate for a test and they're available, it's critical to get tested. That's how South Korea stymied the spread of coronavirus.
Testing innovations could make testing faster and more widespread. For example, the medical-device maker Abbott Laboratories says it will make 50,000 five-minute tests a day, starting on April 1. But you'll still need the swabs.
""[Abbott's test] may go a long way to ensure there are easy ways to test any specimens that are taken,"" said Cameron.
Yet, beyond testing, there's another powerful weapon to significantly slow the spread of coronavirus. You know it well: 
social distancing
. It's all the more critical to avoid contact with others because a whopping one in four people may have no symptoms at all, according to CDC director Robert Redfield.You could be completely well and infecting others. 
So social distance. And if you need to get tested, don't be deterred by the long Q-tip or unnerving swab graphics. ""Its normal this is a normal procedure,"" said Cameron."

In fact, because so much television is being watched during unconventional daytime hours and streaming services offer viewers the ability to watch whenever they want traditional primetime TV viewing is being completely altered.
A new study
 by streaming analytics company Conviva found that streaming TV viewing between the hours of 10am and 5pm is growing as people stay home to combat the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The biggest increase in streaming TV consumption is during the 11am to noon block where viewing time has risen by 43 percent.
Conviva found that more people are watching TV during the hours of 10am and 5pm.
Image: conviva
Streaming watch hours during that daytime period were up almost 40 percent between March 17 and March 23 as compared to the two-week span right before it when most people, who are now home, were still going to work or attending classes.
Traditionally, primetime television hours have been between 8pm and 11pm in the U.S. Networks have historically aired their biggest TV series and events during this timeframe as most people are home from work or school and sitting in front of the TV screen.
But due to the coronavirus pandemic, thats not the case right now. 
Streaming services provide consumers with the ability to watch practically anything they want, whenever they want. Now that these consumers are stuck at home, theyre shifting the hours where most people are watching TV.
Interestingly, the study found that the only time period to see a drop in viewership is what's traditionally considered the primetime TV hours of 8pm to 11pm, which saw a decrease of about 2 percent. 
Overall, streaming hours in the U.S. have now increased by more than 25 percent as compared to the beginning of March. Streaming hours are also up around the world by more than 20 percent.
Earlier this month, companies like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube committed
 to temporarily lowering stream quality to free up bandwidth because so many people were using their platforms. This new study is just the latest confirmation that people are increasingly turning to streaming services to keep themselves busy during the pandemic."

If you don't want people seeing how messy your bedroom is, for example, you can just enable a virtual Zoom background that makes it look like you're in Hawaii, or perhaps the red room from Twin Peaks, which is what my hooligan friends have been doing.
The key to success is customizing your Zoom background.
Image: zoom
Here's how:
<ol><li>Click on the little arrow next to the ""Stop Video"" button in the lower left 
</li><li>Then click ""Choose Virtual Background"" 
</li><li>Once you're in there, click the little plus sign to add an image or, no joke, a video. 
</li></ol>Yes, you can make your background a looping video of your choosing, so long as you have the file on hand. 
It's a deeply stupid and possibly annoying thing to do to your friends. That said, all of our brains are melting, and there's something mildly comforting now about watching a 25-year-old episode of Dragon Ball Z with no audio and your friend in an office chair superimposed in front of it. 
This isn't a hack so much as it's a basic feature of Zoom, but I've had to explain it to enough people over the last couple of weeks that it belongs here anyway.
Know your Zoom hotkeys
Using your computer's mouse or trackpad is so 20th century. Who has time to click through menus to try to make anything work? Luckily, Zoom has a bundle of built-in hotkeys you can use to do pretty much anything.
They're obviously going to be different between Mac and Windows, but the principle is the same. 
On Mac, you can quickly shut off your camera by pressing Command+Shift+V. You know, V for Video! The same rule applies for most hotkeys: Command+Shift+M for mute, Command+Shift+S for screen share, so on and so forth.
You can also change them to whatever you want in the ""Keyboard Shortcuts"" section of the settings menu, for what it's worth.
Copy that Zoom meeting link
While digging through Zoom's preferences menu for ideas for this piece, I found a fun little box you can check to save yourself a few seconds every time you start a Zoom call for your friends. Behold, one of the first choices in the ""General"" area of the settings menu:
Image: zoom
That's turned off by default, but those of us who like to take initiative and start Zoom calls for our friends will appreciate it. Instead of having to click through the invite menu to find a link to post in the group chat, turning that option on will copy it to your clipboard as soon as you start the meeting.
Think of everything you can do with the 10 seconds you just saved!
No Zoom time limits
Every video chat service has its limitations, and Zoom isn't some exception to that rule. The biggest problem new Zoom users might face as they try to stay in touch with friends and family is the 40-minute time limit on free video calls. That just won't work for most of us.
The good news is there are a few ways to get around this, and you don't have to pay any money for most of them. This is purely anecdotal, but I've hosted multiple two to four-hour calls recently that never ended, despite the fact that I don't pay for Zoom. The company has lifted the restriction entirely in China and for schools in the U.S., but regular folks in the states might be able to get away with long calls if they take a chance.
If you do get kicked off, the easiest thing to do is just start another call and invite all the same people back to it. If this is too much work for you, $15 gets you a month of calls with no limits. Regardless of how you choose to do it, circumventing the 40-minute limit is pretty easy.
Look nice and smooth on Zoom
Image: zoom
Our last Zoom tip is maybe the strangest. If you don't have time or the will to moisturize before a call, though, you might be thankful for it.
In the ""Video"" section of the settings menu, you might notice something called ""Touch Up My Appearance."" According to Zoom's support website, this puts a soft focus over the image you output to other users to make your skin look better. Uh, neat!
Seriously, though, I assume at least one person out there will find this useful. As a person who is frequently not thrilled with the way they look over a webcam, I totally get it, and will be using this feature until further notice.
This is by no means an exhaustive list of every Zoom hack, but taking advantage of everything on it is an easy and quick way to make the experience better. Nobody wants teleconferencing to be the only way to interact with their friends, but we're here and we have to do the best with what we have."

From students who rely on free and reduced meals in schools (and whose schools are now closed), to  seniorcitizens who are staying indoors, making it hard for them to buy groceries, to service workers who are being laid off and may live paycheck to paycheck already, to single motherswho struggled to afford food pre-coronavirus and now must contend with feeding their children during school closings, the coronavirus is making it difficult for many people to eat. 
COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, doesn't affect everyone equally and, even before the  pandemic, 5.6 million households in the U.S. were experiencing very low food security. 
""People who are the most vulnerable, depending on your race, your class, your zip code, and the type of work you do are really the ones that are hit the hardest,"" said Noreen Springstead, CEO of WhyHunger, which supports grassroots organizations in the U.S. and around the world that are providing food to people. ""It [coronavirus] really shows the deeper inequities in our society and those are the people who will be coming en masse to food banks and food pantries."" 
The virus complicates matters further because it's so widespread. 
""This is the equivalent of a Sandy or Katrina happening but not in a few states, but in all states at once, combined with an economic collapse,"" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America which helps low-income people sign up for food assistance through the federal programs SNAP and WIC, said. 
So, while you're social distancing, here are six organizations you can support that are working to ensure people can eat while the coronavirus rages on. Each nonprofit has a three or four star rating on Charity Navigator, which evaluates charitable organizations in the U.S.  
Feeding America
Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 meal pantries serving over 40 million Americans every year, set up a COVID-19 Response Fund with an initial $2.65 million, a Feeding America spokesperson told Mashable in an email. The fund will help support food banks respond to the pandemic in their communities, including building an inventory of emergency food boxes and distributing them to member food banks across the nation as needed. 
If you can make a donation to the fund, it will help Feeding America continue its work to supply its network of food banks around the country with the resources it needs to feed people during the coronavirus crisis. But if you can't, there are still ways you can help. You can raise awareness about the work food banks are doing during this pandemic by re-sharing their social media content. If you're healthy and feel safe doing so, you can volunteer at your local food bank, which are facing a shortage of volunteers across the country. Some food banks  are implementing drive-through distributions in hopes of limiting the spread of the virus and equipping volunteers with gloves and hand sanitizer to safeguard their health. To find a food bank near you, you can use Feeding America's food bank locator. 
Hunger Free America
In addition to helping low-income people sign up for food assistance, the national advocacy and direct service organization Hunger Free America runs the National USDA Hunger Hotline, which connects people with emergency food. 
Like Feeding America, Hunger Free America also has a coronavirus fund. The money you give will allow the organization to sign up even more Americans for benefits to help them get nutrition assistance. The process to sign up for these benefits, Berg said, can be arduous and his staff assists eligible people (sometimes in multiple languages) and submits the paperwork for them.
Berg believes the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which President Trump signed into law Wednesday night, is an important tool in the fight against coronavirus, calling it the ""most progressive disaster relief bill in modern American history."" It provides $500 million in funding for WIC, $400 million to assist local food banks, and temporarily suspends the requirement during the coronavirus crisis thatmandates most SNAP beneficiaries must be registered for work. Hunger Free America spoke with congressional staff about the bill, telling them what they thought should be included in it. It also advocated to encourage public support for the bill, published a press release on Monday, calling for the Senate to immediately pass it, and tweeted a video of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraging the same. 
Now the organization plans to work with governments to help them roll out the law quickly and efficiently and also help sign up people for these food assistance benefits. 
""Our top response to this crisis is to get government to do its job because the most important thing your readers need to understand is all the charity in the world is only going to marginally dent this problem,"" Berg said. 
No Kid Hungry 
No Kid Hungry
, a national campaign run by the nonprofit Share Our Strength, which works to end hunger and poverty in the U.S. and abroad, is offering emergency grants to school districts and community organizations during the COVID-19 outbreak. These grants will provide funds to feed kids who are missing out on school meals due to school closures. 
In its first granting round, No Kid Hungry will immediately provide $1 million in grants, targeting some of the first places that announced school closures due to coronavirus, including California, Washington, D.C., and Maryland. The organization will continue to fund these grants after it has surpassed the $1 million mark, a spokesperson for No Kid Hungry told Mashable. 
Your money will go toward the organization's support of school and community organizations to address child hunger throughout the nation during the COVID-19 crisis, provide funding for the emergency grants, and continue No Kid Hungry's work to ensure communities can support children's access to three healthy meals a day. As needs change, the organization will keep people up to date on its response and ways you can help here. 
No Kid Hungry also urged the House to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act last week with a statement on its website and provided readers with a call script to help push it through the U.S. senate. Now that the bill is law, No Kid Hungry wants a nationwide increase to SNAP benefits ""because we know that in addition to that program being an effective and efficient way to feed children, its also shown to be a very effective stimulus to the economy. Most people dont know that every new SNAP dollar generates up to $1.50 in economic activity, every $1 billion invested in SNAP supports 13,600 jobs,"" a spokesperson wrote to Mashable.   
WhyHunger
WhyHunger supports grassroots organizations in the U.S. and globally that are providing food to people but also works on the root causes of hunger from racial inequality to low wages that can act as barriers for people to access food, Springstead, its CEO, told Mashable. 
WhyHunger refers people in the U.S. to food pantries, soup kitchens, summer meal sites, government nutrition programs, and grassroots organizations through its national Find Food online database, hotline (1-800-548-6479), and texting service. Its database is home to about 30,000 food agencies in the U.S. Hotline volunteers also refer people to statewide SNAP benefit enrollment (the texting service can't connect people with SNAP benefits). Even during the coronavirus pandemic, the hotline is staffed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT, Monday through Friday, Springstead said. 
WhyHunger set up a Rapid Response Fund to provide immediate economic relief and direct support to the people most impacted by hunger and poverty during the COVID-19 crisis. The money will be used to support food banks and pantries struggling to meet increased demand and adapt distribution to protect their staff and communities they serve, small farmers who are facing lost income due to local markets closing, restaurant and food chain workers who are dealing with economic hardship because of coronavirus, and WhyHunger's Find Food database, texting service, and hotline. 
""Our bedrock principle is that we believe nutritious food is the most fundamental human right and having access to it is critical,"" Springstead said.
Meals on Wheels America
Meals on Wheels America delivers food to seniors across the country. The organization's website states that almost 9.5 million seniors in the U.S. are threatened by hunger and 7.1 million seniors live in poverty, which means they only have $234 or less to spend each week. 
During the pandemic, Meals on Wheels is adjusting how it gets meals to seniors to reduce the chances of person-to-person contact. Volunteers can't enter seniors' homes anymore, a spokesperson for Meals on Wheels wrote in an email to Mashable. In addition to food, visits provide needed socialization that many seniors lack and home-delivered meals can help alleviate seniors' loneliness. This benefit will likely be challenged by coronavirus. 
Its COVID-19 Response Fund will help ""local communities across the country meet the increased demand for nutritious meals that can keep our seniors safe and healthy,"" according to the Meals on Wheels website. Funds will also subsidize additional transportation and personnel costs and enable the organization to check in on isolated seniors electronically. 
Meals on Wheels is pleased that Congress passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which includes $250 million for programs like Meals on Wheels. The law underscores the importance of this action, stating ""nearly two-thirds of recipients of home-delivered meals report these meals as more than half of their food intake for the day.
""As the impact of the coronavirus continues to change and the need for senior nutrition services grows, its essential that seniors and the community-based organizations that serve them are represented and protected in future emergency packages that are being considered in Washington. Were assessing and engaging in that legislative process now,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable.

Mazon
Mazon, a national Jewish organization that mobilizes the Jewish-American community to advocate for anti-hunger policy, focuses on populations that are often overlooked. This include military families, veterans, seniors (especially LGBTQ seniors who face unique food insecurity challenges), college students, rural, and Indigenous communities. Mazon also supports the work of agencies in some of the most food-insecure states to make sure the needs of low-income individuals and families are heard on both the state and local level. 
Though Mazon doesn't have a separate coronavirus fund, it is directing much of its efforts to its coronavirus response by advocating on behalf of the distinct nutritional needs of the above groups during COVID-19, Josh Protas, Mazon's vice-president of public policy, told Mashable. You can donate here, although your money may not go specifically to coronavirus efforts."

It was. 
SEE ALSO: Inside the red zone: Photos show dramatic impact of Italy's coronavirus lockdown
The video, which has 95,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes as of now, is fake. It does show isolated Italians singing together on their balconies, but the audio was dubbed on top from another source. 
Everyone's flawless American accents should have been the first clue that something was up. And the fact that all those people knew every word to ""Bitch Better Have My Money,"" which is more likely to happen at an actual Rihanna concert.
Fear not though, the real audio is almost as delightful as the fake. In a plot twist that seems to indicate we can have nice things, those isolated Italians are actually...doing the Macarena. 
Yup. They're having a throwback dance-off in isolation. The original video was included in a collection of videos compiled by Leonardo Carella, an Italian doctoral candidate at Oxford, who identified the city as Turin in a longer thread showing people playing music in Naples, Siena, Florence, and a number of other cities. 
SEE ALSO: How Italy is fighting its coronavirus isolation with music
A close look at the Turin video does indeed show people doing the Macarena's unmistakable dance moves, booty-shakes and all, which is the third clue that something was up with the Rihanna audio. 
Seriously, there are like five songs that require extremely distinctive dances and this is one of them. Any other video would have been easier to fake. 
Still, the Rihanna clip did its job in spreading joy and Fenty fever, and no one is under any obligation to stop sharing it. Just know that coronavirus can't stop the internet from being the internet and to take even the benign things with a grain of salt."

Entrance fees are suspended indeterminately at parks that remain open. As former Park Service director Jon Jarvis told Mashable on Monday, it's critical to keep parks open right now, to provide us the open space we need to escape increasingly necessary, but severe, social distancing guidance which often means staying inside when we're in our communities.
Importantly, the agency has given parks the ability to close down their crowded, problematic areas namely, visitor centers where people congregate. Social distancing means staying six feet away from people, according to the CDC. The health agency now recommends canceling all mass gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus infection, which leads to the respiratory disease COVID-19.
What's more, suspending entrance fees means the public doesn't need to interact and exchange money with a park employee.
Every national park site (of which there are 419) is, of course, different, meaning not all parks can stay open. For example, Pearl Harbor National Memorial, where a boat ferries visitors to a floating memorial over the sunken USS Arizona, prudently closed.
But many parks can stay open (like Point Reyes National Seashore), while certain visitor centers and fee stations close, because these open-air parks are mostly conserved swathes of the great outdoors. As Jarvis said, unless there's a severe local outbreak near a park or local restrictions on traveling, these open places can be an asset during these unsettling times.

It's unknown how long parks will remain free. But infectious disease experts expect coronavirus to continue spreading, and for society to likely be dramatically disrupted for at least months. A vaccine is still, at minimum, a year away."

""For weeks now, Trump's been acting like coronavirus is no big deal,"" says Colbert. ""Even as cases mounted, he said it was under control. He told us to relax. He said warnings about it were a Democratic hoax. He said the infection rate would go to zero. He said it would miraculously go away on its own.

According to Schultz, his talented pup, who was literally named Odafin (after the Law &amp; Order character Odafin Tutuola,) howls along to the catchy theme song every single time he hears it. Like, truly. Every. Time. Schultz shared a few more videos to prove Odafin's love for the series, and said he has recorded so many of the hilarious moments that the footage takes up most of his phone's memory.
Though Odafin clearly has a special place in his heart for Law &amp; Order (or should we say Paw &amp; Order?) he's not the only one to get down to the theme song. Apparently, dogs just love it.

While Zoom's popularity skyrocketed, a slew of privacy and security issues with various aspects of the software emerged, some of them quite dangerous. 
Now, Zoom is taking the steps to remedy this. In a lengthy blog post, Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan apologized for the issues and said the company will now direct its efforts into fixing them. 
""We recognize that we have fallen short of the communitys and our own privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry,"" he wrote.
In the post, Yuan explained that the app's maximum daily number of users went from 10 million in December to 200 million in March, putting tremendous strain on the company to scale the service up in order to accommodate the new users. Additionally, Zoom's user base expanded from primarily institutional customers to a ""much broader set of users,"" which presented Zoom with ""challenges"" the company ""did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.""
He outlines some of the steps the company has already undertaken to fix the mounting security and privacy problems, including preventing Zoom iOS client from sending data to Facebook for no good reason, fixing a bug which allowed an attacker to retrieve other users' Windows login credentials, clarifying the nature of encryption on its platform and updating its privacy policy.
Perhaps even more importantly, Zoom has committed to spend the next 90 days proactively working on potential security issues. The company won't release any new features during this period, instead directing all its efforts into strengthening security, and it will work with third party experts to identify potential issues. Furthermore, Zoom the company will release a transparency report, detailing ""information related to requests for data, records or content.""

Forget the lamb  March went in like a lion and out like a raging, toilet paper-hoarding chimera as the spread of the novel coronavirus reshaped life as we know it. In just the past month, we've seen offices, schools, and businesses shuttered; concerts, weddings, festivals, and major sporting events postponed; and sweeping stay-at-home orders enacted, turning major cities into veritable ghost towns. (Has it really only been a month? It feels like a few decades.)
Given these developments, it should come as no surprise that everyone's starting to feel shaken up: In a new Pew Research Center survey published March 30, nearly nine out of ten U.S. adults say their personal life has changed at least a little because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 44 percent saying it's changed the way they live ""in a major way.""
In these increasingly dire times, a new ""normal"" has emerged and with it comes new essentials for dealing with our ever-evolving reality. Whether you have the privilege to work from home, are  dealing with childcare challenges, or are simply bored, there are a few things out there that can help make this time a bit better. And as a way to give back, we'll be donating 100% of the affiliate commission earned here to NY Presbyterian and Feeding America.
Here's what you need and where to find it:
1. Streaming services
Image: netflix
There's been no better time to tackle your entire queue (or start that series you've been meaning to watch forever) than when you're stuck at home social distancing. If you haven't already, be sure to take advantage of popular streaming services' free trials: CBS All Access recently extended its trial period from seven days to 60 when you use the codes GIFT and ENJOY at checkout, while Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and Amazon Prime Video will all let you watch for free for 30 days (no codes required). Sling TV, meanwhile, is free for your first two weeks, and Disney+, HBO Now, and Apple TV+ won't charge you for your first week of watching.
While you're at it, be sure to grab a media player or streaming stick it'll put all of your streaming content in one place for easy access. Best Buy has several Roku models in stock (starting at $29).
If you're looking to upgrade your entire TV setup, you've got a few shopping options: Dell's website features all sorts of deals on Vizio, LG, Sony, and Samsung 4K smart displays, many of which come with e-gift cards worth up to $250.
2. Work-from-home gear
Image: flexispot
If you're fortunate enough to be working from home amid the spread of COVID-19, you'll need a few things to stay productive. 
We highly recommend getting a standing desk (like the FlexiSpot) or a well-made gaming chair with ample back support for the sake of your posture, as well as some quality blue-light-blocking glasses from Felix Gray or Warby Parker to combat digital eyestrain.
Finally, if you need a new laptop for your WFH setup, Best Buy had plenty of notebooks in stock the last time we checked (and many come with free security software). You might also consider buying a refurbished device to save a couple bucks if so, you can find lots of good deals on ebay, where we recently saw a 13-inch, 256GB Apple MacBook Air on sale for $449.97. (For context, it originally retailed for $1,099.) 
3. Teleconference services
C'mon and Zoom: With more people seeking ways to stay in touch (and celebrate milestones) with coworkers, friends, family, and former Victorious costars amid social distancing, the easy-to-use video conferencing platform saw a gigantic increase in its daily user numbers in March. Plans start at $14.99 for small teams and businesses, but if you're just using it for personal calls up to 40 minutes long, it's totally free to use. (FWIW, FaceTime is also an option so long as you're an iOS user.)
Don't have a webcam yet? Grab one before they sell out everywhere Dell still has some Logitech models in stock starting at $39.99.
4. Video games
Image: nintendo
Social distancing is turning a lot of people into gamers as we look for new ways to keep ourselves entertained at home. The Nintendo Switch is still sold out everywhere, unfortunately everyone and their grandma wants to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons but Xbox One and Playstation 4 consoles, bundles, and games remain aplenty at Best Buy. You can also download The Sims 4 to your computer for just $5 right now, so there's that.
A special note for Xbox users: Don't miss Microsoft's ongoing sale on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate plans, which include Xbox Live Gold (for multiplayer gaming) and access to the Game Pass's huge library of games if you sign up ASAP, you'll get your first month for just $1. Click here to learn more.
5. Online classes
Image: skillshare
Along those same lines, being forced to stay at home because of a global pandemic means we've got *plenty* of time on our hands to learn something new, whether for personal or professional development. Udemy, SkillShare, and Coursera are three great options for traditional online learning, whereas MasterClass features some fun celebrity-taught courses that might inspire you to pick up a new hobby. (Ever wanted to take cooking lessons from Gordon Ramsay? Now's your chance.) 
6. Telemedicine
Image: talkspace
Health anxiety is a real bitch but what if your therapist's office is closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus? Luckily, you can always reach out for (virtual) help: Online mental health support from licensed professionals is available via apps like BetterHelp ($160 to $280 per week) and Talkspace ($260 to $396 per month), the latter of which now has a dedicated COVID-19 anxiety management program. 
Swapping your dire Twitter feed for a mindfulness/meditation app can also work wonders for your stress levels in times like these. Give Calm or HeadSpace a download both apps are currently offering free trials for new users. (And if you're a U.S. healthcare professional who's working in a public health setting, you can use Headspace Plus for free through 2020.)
7. Meal kit delivery services
Image: hellofresh
Grocery stores are essential businesses, meaning they can stay open during stay-at-home orders, but proper social distancing means you should try to limit your errand runs as much as possible. 
You can always have your groceries delivered by a service like Instacart, but if you don't want to bother with insanely long delivery times (or cross picket lines), meal kit services like Blue Apron, Home Chef, Green Chef, Hungryroot, HelloFresh, and Purple Carrot are another convenient option for all of us hermits. (Psst click here to find out how Mashable readers can get $30 off their first Purple Carrot box.)
8. Alcohol delivery services
Image: saucey
Bars and some liquor stores may be closed for the foreseeable future, but all is not lost: Alcohol delivery services like Saucey, Drizly, WSJWine, Boxed, Maivino, and Winc are still up and running. Click here to find out how you can save on select orders.
9. Home workout equipment (and online workout classes)
Image: unsplash
Since most gyms are shuttered, too, and since laying on the couch all day is an invitation for crippling lower back pain, at-home workouts have become the move lately. If you've got the space for cardio equipment, you can save hundreds of dollars on a ProForm treadmill, a ProForm elliptical, or a NordicTrack exercise bike right now at Best Buy. Otherwise, services like Aaptiv, ClassPass, BodyBoss, and Crunch Live are all offering free trials or access to video and audio exercise content so you can stay in shape while stuck at home.

As things currently stand, LELO, MysteryVibe, and Babeland are all running promotions on select toys, and Dame Products is donating 1% of its sales to the Food Bank for New York City. Doesn't that just make you feel all warm and tingly inside?"

On Sunday, the Bronx Zoo announced that one of its majestic Malayan tigers tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, three other tigers and three lions (who were not tested) were also sick and hacking. The zoo said an infected zookeeper transmitted the virus to the exotic cats, which became a well-publicized instance of the insidious microbe jumping between animal species. 
Though it might sound strange that large, dominant cats have fallen ill to the same parasite that has severely sickened and killed people around the globe, infectious disease experts aren't surprised. Animals often pass diseases to other animals. And some 75 percent of emerging infectious diseases in humans come from other animals species, known as ""zoonotic diseases."" 
For example, the SARS outbreak in 2003 (also a coronavirus) spread from bats, to another animal, to humans. MERS jumped from camels to humans. The dog flu that swept through greyhounds in 2004 came from horses. This latest coronavirus likely originated in bats. There are untold numbers of viruses living in wild animals that could potentially jump from species to species. It's just a matter of time.
""Jumps between species are often the reason why we get pandemics,"" said Rebecca Dutch, a virologist and chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. (The grim Bubonic Plague, for instance, comes from a bacterial pathogen transferred by fleas).
""The next ones are out there,"" Dutch added, noting that we already know of many bat coronaviruses. Another one, at some unknown point, may again jump to another species, perhaps eventually to humans.
Of course, zoonotic viruses can't jump to all species. The virus has to be able to match with the proteins on an animals' cells, somewhat like a key fitting a lock. For example, mice cannot currently catch this new coronavirus, officially called SARS-CoV-2. ""There are species that aren't infected, but some species that are,"" said Dutch. Some viruses can only live in one species and can't jump to other animals, like smallpox (which was eradicated) and measles in humans.
Unfortunately for humans, SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to people, likely having first hopped between an intermediary creature, perhaps a pangolin. And now the virus has jumped to big cats in the Bronx, if not elsewhere. But, critically, it's unknown if the microbe can jump from cats back to humans. 
""We have no evidence that a cat can infect a human right now,"" said Siobain Duffy who researches the evolution of viruses at Rutgers University. Though, there's some evidence cats can spread the virus to other cats. (It's also unknown how easy it is for a cat to catch coronavirus from people, but if it were easy, epidemiologists would have probably picked up on this source of infection by now.)
From Dr. Paul Calle, Bronx Zoo chief veterinarian; ""The COVID-19 testing that was performed on our Malayan tiger Nadia was performed in a veterinary school laboratory and is not the same test as is used for people.

Once a virus, like a coronavirus, gets in humans, then there's good potential for an epidemic, or, at worst, a pandemic. That's because the virus isn't just infecting an isolated population of animals in a forest somewhere. Now it's hopping on 600-mph commercial airliners.
""Theyre getting around the world,"" said Dan Janies, a professor of bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who researches the genetics of zoonotic viruses.
In the 2003 SARS outbreak, for example, the virus first likely jumped from bats to another unknown animal to humans, but eventually started passing between civets cats and humans in Guangdong, China. The virus was discovered in cages in a restaurant where raccoon-like civets were served. Infected people then traveled. ""Then it went to humans around the world,"" said Janies, who found the SARS virus originated in bats.
""Lots of viruses are out there.""
""We rapidly spread [viruses] because we travel so well,"" added Dutch. ""We give them all sorts of chances for new places to go."" 
Although scientists know many infectious diseases in humans come from other animals, like bats, we're not vigilantly researching all the coronaviruses in bats and where they could potentially jump. It's not a research priority until it is. ""Its not a medical problem when it's hanging out in bats,"" said Janies. 
As for now, the new coronavirus that likely jumped from bats, to another animal, to humans, and now Bronx Zoo cats has resulted in lions and tigers that are sick, but doing alright. 
""All of our tigers and lions are doing well and continue to improve daily,"" said Dr. Paul Calle, the Bronx Zoo Chief Veterinarian.
The same can't be said for humans, where U.S. hospitals are filled with severely sick people, many who need machines to breathe.
This coronavirus with a vaccine a year or so away at best already foreshadows the next inevitable viral leap from animals to humans. So society must prepare, emphasized Dutch. ""We need to be more forward-thinking,"" she said. This means preparing to rapidly test and then isolate infected people which the U.S. failed to do for this pathogen. It also means preparing potential antiviral drugs that can be tested and rapidly deployed when the next epidemic, or pandemic, hits.
It will.
""Lots of viruses are out there,"" said Dutch. ""The question is, when will it enter the human population?"""

Conan O'Brien and Stephen Colbert compared notes on how home recording has been working for them on Tuesday, and it's fair to say both are feeling the social distance.

""Well what about your show, do you miss that?"" quipped Colbert. 
Even so, the Late Night host admitted he feels the same.

, a survivor of domestic violence. She described what current victims might be going through: ""You just never know what little thing that you do that might set them off or even what might set them off, even if you don't do it."" 
For many people, social distancing is a boring slog. Take one look at social media and you'll find people binge-watching shows and taking care of their sourdough starter.
For those in abusive relationships, however, staying at home is a nightmare. As Voss described, these people may feel trapped, frightened, or scared for themselves and their children if they're parents. 
SEE ALSO: How to live with anxiety disorders and not develop one during coronavirus lockdown
The ramifications of social distancing on domestic violence are already being seen: Police departments around the country have reported an increase in domestic violence-related calls in March
. Even though dips in calls have also been reported
, that can be a bad sign as well: These victims may not ever feel safe enough to call. 
External factors like stress and financial strain can negatively impact victims and create circumstances where their safety is further compromised according to Christina So, Communications Director at the National Domestic Violence Hotline
 (NDVH). ""Our experience informs us that in homes where abuse is already occurring, and there is a negative financial impact or added stress in the home, we typically see a higher frequency of incidents of abuse and increased severity of abuse,"" said Katie Ray-Jones, Chief Executive Officer of NDVH and loveisrespect
, an inclusive space for young people to learn about healthy relationships. As Anita Bhatia, the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Women, told TIME last month, ""the very technique we are using to protect people
 from the virus can perversely impact victims of domestic violence."" 
So what can people who are not personally impacted by domestic violence do? How can we help?
A huge way to help, according to So, is to support the National Domestic Violence Hotline
. The entire staff is currently remote, and they serve as a backup for other hotlines and providers from local and regional organizations who may have had to suspend their services due to the pandemic. 
""We're completely prepared to support anyone who needs our help, and to help them find the best resources possible,"" said So.
It's likely that your hometown has resources as well that could benefit from financial donations, such as Safe Horizon
, which provides advocacy and support to domestic violence victims and survivors in New York City. For those in the US, the US Department of Health and Human Services has a list of resources
 available by state. In the UK, for example, Solace Women's Aid
 is raising £150,000 in what they're calling the #StaySafeAtHome Covid-19 Emergency Appeal. Do your research, and if you're able to donate to a non-profit or hotline in your area.
Another way to help is to build community around victims and survivors. Isolation is one of the strongest tactics an abuser can use, So emphasized, so supporting them in a time like this is essential. Isolation from loved ones, constant surveillance, strict rules, and restrictions on basic necessities, are all tools for abusers and can flourish during social distancing. Indeed, NDVH has seen an increase in calls about how abusive partners are using COVID-19 to further isolate, coerce, or insert fear into the relationship according to Ray-Jones.
""I'm already hearing from survivors about how COVID-19 is being used by abusive partners to further control and abuse,"" So said similarly.
""By checking in with people regularly, you can keep an eye out for warning signs of abuse by an intimate partner or family member.""
Pamela Zaballa, Global Executive Editor of NO MORE
, encouraged people to reach out to victim/survivors
 in a blog post. ""If you know or suspect that somebody suffers from domestic violence, please contact them, and keep that vital line of support open,"" Zaballa wrote. ""This is one disease where washing our hands amounts to indifference."" 
Knowing about a controlling or abusive relationship is different than suspecting one, of course, but heed to Zaballa's advice for both. If you know a friend is generally isolated and you believe their partner could be abusive, now's an important time to stay connected. 
Here's what you can do:  talk to them by phone or video call, or be a part of their safety plan
. Are there people in their space who are safe and can act as a buffer (someone whose presence would reduce the risk of interactions between the victim and abuser)? Can they take walks outside while maintaining social distancing? Ask them and find out. Voss offered a tip of having a word or phrase as a signal that they need help. 
""By checking in with people regularly, you can keep an eye out for warning signs
 of abuse by an intimate partner
 or family member,"" Erinn Robinson, press secretary at RAINN, told Mashable over email. ""If you think someone may be experiencing abuse, let them know that you are a part of their support network and that they can reach out, either on the phone or via video chat.""
If you're unsure of what to say or how to go about speaking with a victim/survivor, RAINN has a friends and family toolkit
 to support a loved one, which breaks down and expands the TALK acronym: thank them for telling you; ask how you can help; listen without judgment; and keep supporting. 
Zaballa urged people to not ignore shouting neighbors, and Voss emphasized to be aware of small signs as well. If you think someone is suffering from domestic violence in your building or nearby, but do not want to get law enforcement involved, So recommended visiting the hotline's website
 or giving them a call at 1-800-799-7233. There are also chat or text services you can reach either through the website or by texting LOVEIS to 222522, should you not be able to speak safely. 
SEE ALSO: The most important thing to know about social distancing
The hotline is able to help anyone create a safety plan, whether they themselves are a victim/survivor or someone concerned about one. ""If somebody is uncomfortable working with law enforcement or doesn't want to make that call, that's absolutely fine,"" said So. ""We just empower people to make the decisions that they know are best for them.""
RAINN's National Sexual Assault Hotline is also available at 1-800-656-HOPE or online.rainn.org
 24/7. It's free and confidential for both victim/survivors of sexual violence and their loved ones, and they can also help with brainstorming safety planning
. 
Ultimately: donate if you can, and look out for others. Whether you're a victim/survivor or a supporter, you're not alone and help is available. ""It's really important that we're helping survivors know that even in times like these there's still hope,"" So said, ""and we're here for them not just as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, but as individuals."" 
If you've experienced domestic or intimate partner violence, you can call the National Domestic Violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233. Additional resources are available on its website
.
If you have experienced sexual abuse, call the free, confidential National Sexual Assault hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), or access the 24-7 help online by visiting online.rainn.org

Your elaborate Nest Cam surveillance setup that's perfect for spying on your neighbors as you shelter in place is a bit grainier than normal. 
The Google-owned service emailed customers today to let them know that, as a result of lifestyle changes made necessary by the coronavirus (i.e., an increase in working from home and corresponding internet usage), it will reduce the default video quality setting for some of its customers. 
""In response to community issues caused by COVID-19, we're temporarily adjusting your camera quality and bandwidth in an effort to conserve internet resources,"" reads the email in part. ""During this time, it's critical for us to work together to ensure we find ways to help the community at large.""
That coming together, apparently, requires a sacrifice of precious camera quality. 
Now, it's important to note that not only is this temporary, but it's also reversible. That's because Google is only lowering the default setting. In other words, if someone absolutely, positively must see their neighborhood raccoons in HD, then they can switch the setting right back. 
That hasn't stopped some customers from voicing their displeasure, however. 
""You have NO RIGHT to adjust the settings on my personal property for any reason!"" wrote one presumed customer. 
""Don't downgrade my service in the name of 'saving the internet' unless you're going to also downgrade your pricing structure,"" wrote another.

While over 23,000 Americans have already died from COVID-19, the president's focus has been on the effects that life-saving measures like social distancing and shutdowns are having on the economy. More specifically, he's been pushing back on the wild idea that it's more important to protect American lives right now than the American economy.
""Now, some people say that Trump values the economy over human life just to help his reelection, but I'm sure he's not thinking about himself here!"" joked Colbert. ""Remember, all his buildings are branded 'OTHER PEOPLE.'""
Trump is also trying to push for the U.S. to be reopened well before experts recommend. The president is now insisting that the same state governors who were on their own when they needed national leadership on shutdowns must now be overruled if they won't end those (again, life-saving) measures. All for the sake of getting the economy going again.
""Opening the country is not up to you, because you did not have the balls to shut the country down in the first place,"" said Colbert pointedly. ""You were the one who said you were just a cheerleader you put yourself on the sidelines."""

 and some Americans are pivoting to bidets
.
But there is another sanitary product that could see the same empty-shelf fate as toilet paper: pads and tampons. As the reality of how long we will need to self-isolate hits us, those who menstruate may feel it necessary to stockpile these products. In fact, it has already started to happen:

 Shumi (@shvmii) March 14, 2020
Given the potential for a shortage, now is a great time to make the switch to a menstrual cup.
Menstrual cups
 are made of silicone or latex rubber and inserted into the vagina. Rather than absorb blood (and other fluids) like a tampon, cups collect blood. Some cups, like the DivaCup, are shaped almost like a wine glass with a stem at the bottom. Nixit, which claims to be a revolutionary menstrual cup, is bowl-shaped. 
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus anxiety has exes sliding into the DMs
Unlike pads and tampons, cups can last for years if cared for properly. Though how many years depends on who you ask. Lunette recommends replacing every 1-2 years
, while Nixit is more vague, though says multiple years
.
Rachael Newton, founder of Nixit, said that customers have been describing pads and tampon shortages and tagging the brand to let their followers know about the alternative. 
""My understanding, from what we've been tagged in, is that they [pads and tampons] are going and shelves are clear in some places,"" Newton said in an interview with Mashable. 
A pad and tampon shortage is just one reason to invest in a cup. In a statement to Mashable, Procter &amp; Gamble, the parent company of sanitary product brands Always, Just, Tampax, and L., said they are committed to serving their millions of customers as well as the health and safety of their employees: 
We are taking the right steps to safeguard our workplaces through appropriate social distancing and work-from-home protocols. These protocols are in line with WHO and CDC recommendations, were developed with our team of in-house medical experts, and are continually refined as we learn more about the epidemic. For our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, where work from home is not an option for most of our employees, we are taking preventive measures that allow these facilities to continue to operate safely, protecting the health and safety of our employees while effectively delivering the business need to serve our consumers and customers.
We have thousands of P&amp;G employees working around the clock to continue serving consumers as many of our products play an important role in maintaining healthy habits and a healthy home environment, both critically important at this time. We are maximizing production and distribution capacity where possible to ensure we can get products to as many consumers as quickly as possible.
In this unprecedented time, having employees ""working around the clock"" may not be enough to quell fears.
What's more, transitioning to a cup can be easier now that we have to stay at home. In month one of the three-month Nixit Plan
, the company recommends using the cup on lighter days and overnight the idea being that you'll be in your own bathroom. ""The more comfortable you become and the more you go know your cycle,"" Newton said, ""the more confident you are to use it out in public."" 
SEE ALSO: Too-real video captures the awkwardness of all your glitchy FaceTime calls
Because of social distancing, it's likely you're using your own bathroom now more than ever. That makes it an ideal time to learn how to use a menstrual cup. ""You are home all the time. You've got your own bathroom. If there's anytime you're going to try one, now's a great time,"" said Newton.
Not to mention that cups have other non-pandemic benefits
 as well: They are better for the environment, your wallet, and your body. They can also last 12 hours at a time as opposed to four to eight hours for a tampon. 
While it's too soon to know exactly how long we will have to self-isolate, it's become more clear that it will take at least several months
. This means several menstruation cycles. Rather than worry about whether stores have sanitary products in stock, buying a cup may give a slight peace of mind and right now, any peace of mind is priceless."

Koalas are slowly being released back into the wild following the unprecedented fires that devastated more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of the country over the summer.
Four adult koalas and one brand new joey have been released in the Kanangra-Boyd National Park in the state of New South Wales. They're the first of 12 koalas rescued from the Blue Mountains area during the bushfires, which have been sheltering at Sydney's Taronga Zoo since January. The others will be fast-tracked due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19), which means there will be 13 in total released back to the wild.
A shocking 10,000 koalas (a third of the total koala population of NSW) are estimated to have died from the bushfires, as well as drought over the summer. Koala hospitals saw an unprecedented increase in admissions during this time, with many being treated for burns and dehydration.
The four (well, five) lucky koalas have been returned to the wild by Sydney-based not-for-profit wildlife conservation organisation Science for Wildlife, with the help of San Diego Zoo Global, the U.S. zoo's nonprofit that works with partners on international conservation projects. 
""While they have coped well in care we are delighted to finally send our koalas home,"" said Dr. Kellie Leigh, executive director of Science for Wildlife in a press statement. ""We have been busy assessing the burnt area that we rescued them from, to establish when the conditions have improved enough that the trees can support them again. The recent rains have helped and there is now plenty of new growth for them to eat, so the time is right. We will be radio-tracking them and keeping a close eye on them to make sure that they settle in OK.""
San Diego Zoo Global and Science for Wildlife have been working together on what's known as the Blue Mountains Koala Project for five years, and they're committed to putting resources toward increasing the koala population in the area. As the bushfires raged across the state of New South Wales, the team made the smart decision to remove as many koalas as they could from the area before the fires engulfed their habitats. While it was only a few koalas, it was something.
""During the massive fires, as 80 percent of the World Heritage Area burnt, we were at risk of losing the entire koala population at this site and so thats what drove us to try something so radical and pull these koalas out before the fire hit,"" said Dr. Leigh. 
The team used previously-installed radio tracking devices to locate the koalas for removal, and it's this technology that will allow them to study how the marsupials adapt during what will be a lengthy reintroduction to the area. ""The radio-tracking devices that enabled us to find the koalas quickly and move them from in front of the fire will now allow us to follow them and find out more about how koalas use the landscape after fire, including where else we might find pockets of surviving koalas,"" said Dr. Leigh. ""That will help us to plan a future for koalas under climate change, where we expect more frequent and intense fires.""
The 12 rescued koalas were given emergency housing and care by Taronga Zoo after their removal. They were some of the lucky ones, as many koalas across the country suffered horrific and often fatal burns, and other injuries due to the fires. Others had their food and water restricted following habitat destruction.
Taronga Zoo vets and nurses treated over 100 koalas across their two hospitals and in the field during the summer of bushfires and drought, according to Nick Boyle, Tarongas director of welfare, conservation and science. ""We were so pleased to be able to assist Science for Wildlife on their mission to save these incredibly valuable koalas. Taronga is committed to ensuring the survival of koalas in Australia,"" said Boyle in a statement. ""Whilst we still have a number of koalas being cared for at Taronga Western Plains Zoo, our attention is also turning to the long-term recovery of koalas in the wild.""

While four koalas doesn't seem like a lot in the larger scheme of things, it's a crucial and positive step toward rehabilitating the area's population the Blue Mountains region is home to the most genetically diverse koalas in Australia, making them important for species conservation. ""There is still a lot of work to be done to assess what is left of koalas in this region and plan for population recovery,"" said Jen Tobey, population sustainability researcher at San Diego Zoo Global, in a statement. We are dedicated to continuing to support this critical work to conserve a significant koala population.""
It's important work, considering in May 2019, the Australia Koala Foundation estimated that there were ""no more than 80,000 koalas in Australia,"" making them ""functionally extinct."" Though this claim has been disputed by researchers, there's little doubt the population was already on the decline before the fires. With up to an estimated 10,000 killed in NSW alone, the future of the koala needs every win it can get from its human helpers."

Now, it's getting increasingly likely that Apple's WWDC 2020 conference isn't going to happen at least not at its usual time, or in its regular format. 
The Santa Clara Public Health Department issued an order on Monday (via Appleinsider) banning mass gatherings with more than 1,000 people due to the increasing rates of the coronavirus. 
This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County. The strong measures we are taking today are designed to slow the spread of disease, said Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody in a statement. 
Since the WWDC typically takes place in San Jose, which is in Santa Clara County, with an attendance of 5,000 or more, it would be forbidden under the terms of the ban, which goes into effect on March 11. 
SEE ALSO: The wheels on Apples $400 Mac Pro dont have a lock. Cool.
This does not automatically mean the WWDC won't take place this year. The event hasn't even officially been announced yet, but it typically takes place in early June, and the mass gatherings ban will initially remain in place for three weeks. 
However, should the coronavirus outbreak worsen, it's safe to assume the mass gatherings ban will remain in place longer, and even if the ban doesn't last until June, Apple surely won't wait that long to announce it (the company typically announces WWDC dates in mid-March). 
Still, there are several possibilities in play for Apple. The company could postpone WWDC for a later date, which is unlikely, or it could turn it into an online-only event, similar to what Google and Facebook have done with I/O and F8, respectively. 
The coronavirus has so far killed more than 4,000 and infected more than 113,000 people. The outbreak has been worsening in the U.S. in recent weeks, with 423 total confirmed cases and 19 deaths."

The Daily Show turned the current crisis into what we all deserve: a disaster thriller. But the disaster isn't the highly contagious coronavirus, it's Trump's complete lack of preparation. From promising vaccines that don't exist yet to shaking hands despite the Centers for Disease Control's warnings to avoid touching, our president is clearly equipped to forge the way through what the World Health Organization just classified as a pandemic. 
""It's going to disappear one day,"" Trump is quoted saying. ""It's like a miracle, it will disappear."" 
Experts worry that without effective action from the government, the disease COVID-19 won't be contained any time soon. And unlike Trump's claims, the coronavirus is not like the flu so far there is no vaccine. 
Until then, you can wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and try to limit social interactions."

Trust the UK weather to bring out the most sun weve seen in 2020 during Quarantine and lock down. #Coronavirus

I understand the absolute necessity of social distancing. I encourage it. Unless things change drastically, I should not be doing my favorite activities. We need to do everything we can to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. 
But beyond the looming fear of the virus a scary, anxiety-inducing thing the small losses in our lives have begun to sting. The thought of not being able to enjoy nice weather, to move freely in the sun with loved ones it is a real loss. And on the first beautiful day in quarantine, I felt that loss acutely. 
It's one of many small, sad realities we'll face amid the coronavirus crisis. We'll all feel these small losses that will accompany the other, large, world-shaking losses the virus is certain to bring. 
These small things will pile up. The birthdays uncelebrated. The laughs not had. The sunshine barely felt. 
When it's summer in New York, I love to ride the ferry out to Rockaway Beach in Queens. The line to get on the boat is always packed. (Nonstarter with the virus). The ferry is always wall-to-wall. (Ditto.) The sandy shoreline overflows with swimsuited bodies. (Sensing a pattern?) And my favorite bar down there, one that's right on the water, attracts more customers than you can imagine. 
The weather is turning. Soon enough, the heat will hit and my brain will think it's time to take the ferry to the beach. Maybe we'll be lucky and the worst of the crisis is past us by then. Most likely not. Even the Olympics, scheduled to kick-off in July, have been pushed backa year. 
But hey, at least we've got FaceTime and Zoom. Maybe a virtual barbecue? Maybe I can set my background to the shoreline. 
It's better than nothing. And it sure beats letting the virus spread unchecked."

And now that we're all stuck at home fighting an actual virus forcing us to avoid all human contact outside our virtual online relationships, it reads like a prescient hipster who knew social-distancing was cool way before everyone else did.
In the age of COVID-19, The Circle is the dumb, mindless, but somehow still heartwarming content we desperately need. And with no Season 2 release date in sight (especially in the wake of the delays sweeping the entertainment industry), there's a circle-shaped hole in our hearts that no other trash TV can fill.
But friends, do not despair, for there is a neon light at the end of this tunnel. There actually is a brand new full season of The Circle you can watch right now to keep you company while in self-quarantine. 
It's The Circle Brazil, and it's just as good (if not superior) of a hang as the American one.
Now, before you let the foreign language turn you off, let me overreach by paraphrasing the words of Parasite director Bong Joon Ho: Once you overcome the one-inch barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so much amazing trash reality TV.
Seriously, though!
The Circle Brazil strikes the perfect balance of familiarity with a satisfying side of wanderlust.
Full disclosure: I am half Brazilian and speak Portuguese, so the barrier is smaller for me to cross. But I also made sure to watch The Circle Brazil with my born-and-bred American, English-speaking partner, who was absolutely as hooked as I was the entire time. He even pointed out some unexpected benefits its foreignness brings to the experience.
A lot of us are in need of comfort food TV that's familiar, distracting, easygoing fun. But at the same time, we're cooped up inside, deprived of the outside world and any new stimuli. The familiar will get boring real quick.
The Circle Brazil strikes the perfect balance of familiarity with a satisfying side of wanderlust. It's the same format you fell in love with from the original, down to the similar archetypes of contestants.
And, hey, maybe you're one of the unfortunate folks who had their upcoming trip abroad suddenly canceled by the global pandemic. Well, now you can take a virtual tour (however warped and constrained) of one of the top tourist destinations in the world.
You'll be treated to a messy-ass caipirinha-fueled Carnival-themed party in episode one, then a virtual Brazilian dance-off guessing game in the next. To be clear, that competition entails a contestant putting on a full-body mo-cap suit that captures a virtual feed of their attempts to do a myriad of Brazilian dances, which the other contestants must then guess correctly.
I mean, could you imagine anything more beautifully batshit than the chaos I just described?
SEE ALSO: How Netflix reality just made streaming a lot less lonely
The cultural differences, rather than creating a barrier, add intrigue to The Circle Brazil and dare I say it even some timely lessons. Because as every gringo (particularly Americans) has told me over the years, no one in the world knows how to have as good a time as Brazilians in the face of crushing economic, social, and governmental crises.  
There's also a stark contrast in the way the two countries evidently view social media, as seen in how the contestants take vastly different approaches to playing The Circle.
While the Americans place a high premium on the notion of being your ""authentic"" self in The Circle, shedding many tears over the real connections they believe they've formed with one another, the Brazilian crowd does away with pretenses. Winning the game is not framed as who's the most loyal, most genuine, or most well-liked of them all.
No, for the Brazilians it's about boldness and charisma, bringing enough personality to the table to remain ""interesting,"" rather than people-pleasing to win over your fellow contestants. And interesting is exactly what they do best.
Truly not even close to the weirdest thing he does

There's little concern over seeming too aggro, calling people out, getting too flirty, or showing too much skin. Many even unabashedly admit to being vain narcissists, and everyone loves them for what is, when you think about it, actually a more honest reflection of who we all are on social media.  People are up front about their profiles being a part they play rather than who they really are. And honey, you bet your ass that means they're using everything they've got to strategize, whether that's catfishing or sparking a romance with ulterior motives.
Basically, The Circle Brazil came here to win (and have a good time), not to make friends. 
That doesn't necessarily mean it's an uglier version of the social media game. But it adds some delicious drama that, retrospectively, the original Circle lacked as everyone fretted over rocking the boat too much.
There are as many similarities between the two nation's versions of the show as there are differences. You still have the pretty girl who thinks she's disliked for being too pretty, the nerd who appears to hail from a different planet entirely, the catfish so wildly missing the mark that you can't believe they last as long as they do.
Ultimately what makes The Circle Brazil worth your time is that it reminds you that, regardless of language, place, or culture, we're all the same beautifully garbage humans underneath it all. And in this moment, many of us are seeking a sense of connection to the global ""we,"" this feeling of togetherness that should come from dealing with the same invisible enemy no matter who you are and where you come from.
On Wednesday, the famed Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking Rio de Janeiro was illuminated by all the flags of the world stitched together, along with uplifting messages of unity in the face of universal crisis. As this global pandemic brings out the worst xenophobia in some, we must insist upon seeing the beauty of our differences as only more evidence of our shared human experience.
Does The Circle Brazil present a whole, authentic picture of what Brazil is really like? Well, only in as much as the American version does which is to say, no, not really.
But in these trying times, what can at least unite In our common love for trash TV.
The Circle Brazil is streaming now on Netflix."

Mashable confirmed Apple's AirPods Pro are also limited to two at once, though you can still fill your shopping bag with as many standard AirPods as your wallet can manage.
There were reports back in January that Apple would face production problems due to the coronavirus, particularly as the company relies heavily on Chinese manufacturers. Even so, the impact has been worse than expected, causing Apple to miss its revenue goals for the quarter. 
The impact of the coronavirus on Apple's production hasn't been restricted to its supply chain in China, either. Numerous workplaces have temporarily shut down as the virus spread across the globe, including at least one of Apple's South Korean suppliers.

Mashable had reached out to Apple regarding the purchase restrictions and will update if we receive a response.
For most people, purchasing more than one iPhone at a time seems the sort of thing you do right before boarding your diamond-studded jet to your private tropical island. However, CNBC points out large families and people such as app developers may have legitimate need for multiple phones.
China's iPhone sales fell by over 60 percent in February as the coronavirus reduced both demand and supply. Apple only reopened its 42 stores in mainland China last week, having begun closing them in January due to the health crisis. All other Apple stores around the globe are closed ""until further notice."""

With most of the U.S. ordered to shelter in place or socially distance, drivers are nearly out of work.
The sudden change in demand is prompting creative thinking to get gig workers back to steady employment, or at the very least, paid.
The Hustle daily business newsletter spoke with 58 full-time U.S. Uber drivers last week and found that average rides per day had dropped from 23 to six and weekly pay from $1,072 to $348. Broken down hourly, pay went from $22 to $9.
During a call Tuesday with two San Francisco Board of Supervisors members and Uber drivers from the ride-share advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising, a resolution was unveiled to change driver employment status ASAP. This would kick in benefits like paid sick leave and unemployment insurance.
At Tuesday's board meeting, the resolution  which calls for an emergency enforcement of California's controversial bill AB 5, which would turn many contract workers into employees was officially introduced. The proposed change would affect only the city of San Francisco.
One Uber driver, Saori Okawa, said on the call that for the past year she's been driving for Uber up to 80 hours per week. But what used to be a three-minute wait to get a ride request is now taking 30 to 45 minutes. ""We drivers are in a state of emergency,"" she said. ""There is no business for us."" Earlier this week, she said she earned $75 (before expenses) after driving for a whole shift. ""I wish I could work from home like other workers,"" she lamented.
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus and work from home policies have messed with ride-sharing and public transit
There are efforts across the country to keep drivers working, or at least working in less risky situations.
In New York City, registered ride-share drivers were offered delivery work making $15 per hour to deliver goods for the city through the city's taxi and ride-share division. Lyft is offering similar delivery opportunities for healthcare services, government agencies, and businesses, along with more risky rides for Lyft's LyftUp Driver Community Task Force to get essential workers to places like grocery stores and hospitals, and caretakers to the homes of those who need them. 
Lyft told drivers it would post any temporary work opportunities Lyft finds from other companies in a weekly email to drivers. Uber Eats and other food delivery apps are a popular alternative for app-based work opportunities.
This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called for U.S. legislators to include Uber drivers in any stimulus packages. A deal on a $2 trillion federal package was struck early Wednesday. Lyft leadership had also promised to work with legislators to protect underworked drivers.
2/2 Ive also asked lawmakers to require companies like @Uber to provide new benefits and protections to independent contractors going forward. Together we can create a new standard for flexible work that benefits all who choose it and is available to as many people as possible.
 dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) March 23, 2020
While gig worker protections and employee classifications were a global issue long before pandemic struck  a case in France earlier this month ruled that one driver could be classified as an employee and not an independent contractor the crisis is now pushing companies and lawmakers to reconsider how they protect their employees. 
It's telling that in Lyft's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2019 it spells out how disastrous this very situation we're in could be.
Any unforeseen public health crises, such as epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability, or other catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.
Drivers are clinging to those disaster recovery plans."

The masks have become a common site not just in Japan but across the globe as the coronavirus, named COVID-19, has continued to spread. But with their popularity come shortages, so Sharp is stepping up its production.
Sharp, which is owned by Foxconn, typically produces displays at the factory. But the company now plans to start producing the masks by the end of March at a rate of 150,000 a day and eventually climbing to over 500,000 a day. 
As the Associated Press astutely notes, these display factories are often ""germ-free... for the sake of high quality."" This makes it a perfect factory for producing masks intended to prevent the spread of germs. 
As for whether or not the masks actually do much, the answer seems to be that if you're healthy, no. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that if you're healthy, you only need to wear one if ""you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection."" 
Additionally, they're only really effective if you're taking other steps like constantly washing your hands.
The WHO also recommends wearing a mask if you are showing any symptoms of the disease.
Additionally, the Center for Disease Control says in its coronavirus FAQ that it doesn't recommend ""people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms.""
Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams took to Twitter to call on people to stop panic-buying masks.
Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! 
They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers cant get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk! https://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9
 U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020

 U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020
Basically, if you don't need to wear a mask, don't hoard them, because that leaves fewer masks for the health care workers who need them. 
There are severe strains on protective equipment around the world,"" the WHO's Dr. Michael Ryan said last week. ""Our primary concern is to ensure that our front line health workers are protected and that they have the equipment they need to do their jobs.

In an effort to help everyone see just how critical social distancing can be during this tumultuous time, people are creating helpful visual aids using matches. 
SEE ALSO: It's time to get serious about coronavirus social distancing
A popular video shared to Instagram by artist @juan_delcan shows a row of matches burning. Once the first match is lit the flame quickly spreads to those nearby, but as soon as one of the matches (with legs) steps out of line the fire becomes contained.
The increased space between the matches helps stop the fire from spreading, just as social distancing will help stop germs from spreading. The visual representation is a stark and clear reminder of why it's so crucial for people even those who feel healthy and might not be experiencing any coronavirus symptoms to stay home when possible and limit exposure to groups.
A similar photo of matches is being shared on social media  often with the caption, ""This photo has been shared by doctors in Greece. 'The one who stayed away saved them all.'""
Again, there's a row of burnt matches, one match removed from the line, and all of the matches beyond it saved from the scorch.
The match concept has inspired a number of Instagram artists to create their own versions of the images. They're now being shared in an effort to encourage isolation and hopefully ""flatten the curve.""
Social distancing not only limits the spread of germs, but it also allows medical professionals to properly care for those already diagnosed with the virus (without an overwhelming influx of new cases).
For all you fans of match visuals out there, here's what social distancing should look like.

The practical implications? The upcoming Abra Community Day event which would likely have seen a surge of players out and about scooping up Abra spawns has been postponed. A number of features have also been tweaked to make it easier to play Pokémon Go from a home setting.
Here's a list of the features changes that are being made, per the official Pokémon Go site:
- A one-time purchase bundle of 30 Incense for 1 PokéCoin. Incense will also last for one hour.
- 1/2 Hatch Distance when Eggs are placed into Incubators during this time period
- PokéStops will now drop Gifts more frequently
- Pokémon habitats will increase and more Pokémon will be appearing in the wild
It's worth noting that while increased spawns and super-cheap Incense (which causes 'mons to spawn in your current location) will make it easier to play from home, you won't be able to do everything from one place. Eggs still require some walking, and PokéStops (unless you have one on your doorstep) still need to be visited to collect items like Pokéballs.

Travel is only permitted under certain special circumstances, including ""urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons."" Those found to be breaking quarantine rules face fines and up to three months in jail.
Checkpoints will be installed on motorways, toll booths, and at airports and train stations. Public transport will remain operational. 
These measures are an extension of strict travel restrictions the country introduced over the weekend for northern Italy, affecting 16 million people. People living in Lombardy and 14 central and northern provinces were informed they could not travel unless they had special permission. 
Popular tourist destinations including Milan, Venice, Padua, Parma, and Rimini were declared ""red zone"" quarantine areas under the weekend's lockdown.

""Social distancing"" measures were introduced across the country, with people being urged to stay one meter away from others in public areas like bars, cafes, and shops. 
Restaurants and cafes will now close at dusk throughout the country. 
Under the drastic new nationwide measures, all public events are banned, including attending cinemas, theatres, gyms, pubs, and discos. Weddings, funerals, and sporting events will be cancelled. All schools and universities will stay shut until April. 
Italian people have been using the Twitter hashtag #iostoacasa, which means ""I'm staying home"" to inform others they were abiding by the new restrictions, and to encourage others to follow suit.

While Abbott and Thermo Fisher are willing to work with Amazon, according to the notes, demand from the US government is apparently taking up all their available capacity. Amazon was nonetheless hopeful that other companies would follow in its path if testing went ahead.
Amazon has declined to comment, while Abbott and Thermo Fisher haven't addressed the report so far.
If accurate, the scoop suggests that Amazon is aware of how important it is to keep infected workers out of its warehouses, whether or not recent protests influenced its thinking. Amazon has increasingly become important during the pandemic as a way to shop for food, health supplies and other necessities without leaving home. Even one infection at a warehouse (19 warehouses have had incidents so far) could leave people without vital goods for a while if it prompts a temporary closure.
At the same time, this also hints that Amazon still has a long way to go before it has a complete defense against COVID-19. The outbreak has already been present in the US for weeks, and Amazon is only just implementing face masks and temperature checks. Even if test supplies weren't a factor, the pandemic could be at or past its peak before warehouse staff have assurances that their coworkers are healthy."

Users who surpassed those limits could be penalized $10 per additional 50 gigabytes, or more. It's unclear if those caps will come back when the pandemic settles down.
We may see more ISPs taking action to improve internet speeds, access and usage soon. Today, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called on the FCC to take aggressive action in response to COVID-19. We don't know yet what that will look like, but if AT&amp;T and Comcast are any indication, it could include a push to increase speeds and lift data caps.

Our FC operations are complex and varied, and with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high.

Amazon is facing increased pressure over employee safety during the coronavirus pandemic.

The United States needed to reopen the economy. To a non-expert, the argument sounded compelling. The author, Silicon Valley growth hacker Aaron Ginn, used Johns Hopkins data to make his point. On Medium, the piece blended in with fact-checked articles from doctors and epidemiologists, until it was debunked in an eviscerating tweet thread by an actual infectious disease expert, Carl T. Bergstrom, a biology professor at the University of Washington. Shortly after, it was taken down. In many ways, this was Medium working as intended. The company operates both as a blogging platform and as a media outlet. Some articles, written by professional journalists who work at one of Medium’s publications, are fact-checked. Others are written by conspiracy theorists and contain dangerous misinformation. After all, the company’s mission, according to CEO Ev Williams, is to level the playing field and encourage “ideas that come from anywhere.” As the pandemic disrupts life in the US, Medium has made strides to stop the spread of misleading health news. Its own publications, like OneZero and Elemental, have covered COVID-19 with the journalistic ethics, editing, and fact-checking you’d expect from a traditional outlet. Medium also started an official COVID-19 blog to promote articles from verified experts. It rolled out a coronavirus content policy and hired a team of science editors. But the decision to curate some content — to hire professional journalists and promote verified articles — has made it harder to tell fact from fiction on the platform. While user-generated pieces now have a warning at the top telling users the content isn’t fact-checked, they look otherwise identical to those written by medical experts or reporters. In some ways, this is the promise of Medium: to make the work of amateurs look professional. Reading a 2,000-word article that contains misinformation about COVID-19 also seems notably different than reading a few of the same ideas in a tweet. It might not have mattered when Medium was a home for productivity hacks. But coronavirus misinformation could put people’s lives at risk. The situation has forced Medium to wade deeper into the waters of content moderation, where big tech firms have been floundering for years. Now, the platform that was built as a home for the world’s “unique perspectives” is in the position of deciding which perspectives actually matter. One of the most prominent voices on Medium about COVID-19 belongs to Tomás Pueyo, another Silicon Valley growth hacker. Pueyo wrote “Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,” which has over 40 million views, making it one of the most widely read articles about the virus. This is the best-case scenario for Medium. Pueyo is a credible non-expert who has a lot to say but no clear place to say it. Also, he can make sense of data. He learned how to read complex academic papers while building social apps in Silicon Valley. When the virus started to spread in the US, he immersed himself in Johns Hopkins’ repository on GitHub to figure out what was going on. Pueyo’s insight, which now seems obvious, was that novel coronavirus cases were growing exponentially. It was a pattern he recognized from when one of his apps had gone viral, adding 7 million users in three months. This comparison — viral apps to viral disease — would normally sound too convenient. This time, it actually worked. Pueyo argued on Medium that the coronavirus problem was worse and more immediate than most people knew or expected. Overnight, his article exploded. Andrew Yang shared it, as did the psychologist Steven Pinker. It was quoted in The New York Times. BuzzFeed called it the “defining piece on the outbreak of COVID-19.” The attention brought with it criticism, mostly focused on Pueyo’s background. He doesn’t have experience in epidemiology, and, to date, he has mostly built apps. One of these, Zoo World, helps people build virtual zoos. Asked about this feedback, however, Pueyo seems delighted. “It’s great!” he says. “You need the checks and balances, especially in my case, because I’m nobody. I have no training in epidemiology.” When A.J. Kay, an essayist in Tempe, Arizona, began learning about COVID-19 cases in the US, she didn’t think the information added up. It seemed off that the disease was being called “highly transmissible,” but only one person in Arizona person had it. (Testing for COVID-19 has notoriously lagged in the US, meaning that many people who may be sick with the disease aren’t counted in the official numbers.) Kay isn’t an epidemiologist. Until last month, her most popular article on Medium was about having her breast implants removed. But she grew more suspicious when her ex-husband lost his job at a local hospital. If there was such a shortage of health care workers, why on earth was one being fired? Also, her child support payments were now at risk. Kay compared the number of known COVID-19 cases with flu data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and came to a surprising conclusion: the virus had come to the United States far earlier than was previously reported. What people were predicting would be the peak — the menacing time when COVID-19 cases would overwhelm hospitals in cities across the US — was likely already happening. If she was right, the draconian measures state governments were enacting, like shutting down nonessential businesses, seemed woefully out of proportion with the problem. In the article, Kay admitted the situation was personal. Last year, she’d discovered she had a tumor in her liver but was told it was too low-risk to remove. Recently, she’d begun developing symptoms that seemed to indicate the disease was spreading. She needed to get a scan but couldn’t because the procedure was considered elective. If Kay could convince people that the virus wasn’t as bad as they thought, she might be able to finally address the problem. She also knew that her entire family had been extremely ill in early January. The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona was reported at the end of January. “I started putting things together in my head and I was like wait a minute…” she says. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth.” Her article, “The Curve Is Already Flat,” got 275,000 views in the first 48 hours it was published. Like Ginn’s piece, it fed into the conservative narrative that the mainstream media had gotten this wrong. Kay says she didn’t intend to take a political stand, but she was happy to see the article go viral. Two days after publishing, Kay received an email from Medium. “Due to elevated risk of potential harm to persons or public health, Medium’s Trust and Safety team has removed the following content,” it said. Medium had concluded that her article contained “health claims or advice which, if acted on, are likely to have detrimental health effects on persons or public safety.” A screenshot of the email Medium sent to A.J. Kay. Kay had watched a similar situation play out with Ginn. She’d liked his article, calling it the “first coronavirus piece that made sense” and was surprised when Medium took it down. Now, she felt like she was also being censored for refusing to play into the popular narrative. “I was naive to think that couldn’t happen to me because I’m telling the truth,” she says. Kay’s piece was quickly republished on a conservative blog, after receiving support from libertarian thinkers who derided Medium for censorship. An editor’s note at the top now reads: “This piece originally appeared on Medium.com and was removed without explanation or warning.” (Ginn’s piece was republished on a different conservative blog.) Medium’s communications team wouldn’t say how, exactly, the company decides to take an article down. They also declined to comment on how they discover misinformation on the platform and wouldn’t say how many people are tasked with finding and regulating content. When asked why, specifically, Kay’s piece was taken down, a company spokesperson sent over the COVID-19 content policy, declining to comment on specifics. Medium did say that it takes into account the newsworthiness of the piece as well as the “context and nature of the posted information, the likelihood and severity of actual or potential harms, and applicable laws” when deciding whether to take action. When asked about Ginn’s piece, Sandee Roston, the company’s head of communications, sent the following statement: We’re giving careful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content on Medium to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety. The Ginn post was removed based on its violation of our Rules, specifically the risk analysis framework we use for ‘ Controversial, Suspect and Extreme content.’ We’ve clarified these rules with our Covid-19 Content Policy to address more specific concerns around the evolving public health crisis, and we are actively taking down Covid-19 stories that violate this, such as the Kay piece. Part of the problem Medium is facing is that the situation is changing so fast. Information that seems true one day can quickly look wrong or out of date by the next. In February, the surgeon general told everyone to stop buying masks. Now, the CDC is urging everyone to wear cloth masks all the time. Journalism, by its nature, is rarely predictive. It tells people what’s true at the moment, often with a bit of analysis. “What seems to be true today may be wrong tomorrow,” wrote Charlie Warzel in The New York Times. BuzzFeed’s late-January article urging people to worry about the flu rather than the novel coronavirus looks laughable today — as does Vox ’s January 31st tweet saying the situation would not become a deadly pandemic. At the time, however, these ideas were the prevailing wisdom. In this period of uncertainty, Medium is giving people a place to speculate and offer concrete solutions — even if those solutions are unverified. For the writers, the stakes are low. If they’re wrong, most of the time, no one will notice. If they’re right, as Pueyo was, they could suddenly become an “expert” overnight. From that lens, Medium’s mission seems like a relic from another era, one where people believed giving everyone a voice on the internet would make the world a better place. Williams admitted as such when he spoke to The New York Times in 2017 about why he thought the internet was broken. “I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,” he said. “I was wrong about that.” It’s unclear how Medium solves that, and its opaque policies surrounding COVID-19 allow the company to enable the spread of misinformation while absolving itself of responsibility. Even Pueyo is self-aware of the platform’s dangers. When asked about people criticizing his article, he was okay with it: “I have no training in epidemiology,” he said. “You should definitely not trust me.”"

No one has it easy during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Amazon has it particularly hard. Google, Facebook, and Netflix all deliver their services over the internet, and a healthy amount of that work can be done from home. Amazon, by contrast, has taken on the job of delivering physical goods to our homes. At a time when tens of millions of Americans are isolated in their homes, Amazon has become a critical lifeline delivering food and supplies. But over the past several days, Amazon has begun to struggle under the weight.
The most significant news so far came Sunday night, when Jason Del Rey broke the news that Amazons famous two-day shipping for Prime members would now be delayed up to a month for non-essential items. Del Rey writes:
An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Recode on Sunday evening that the new April 21 delivery dates are not the result of a technical bug or error; they accurately reflect Amazons current reality.
To serve our customers in need while also helping to ensure the safety of our associates, weve changed our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes to prioritize stocking and delivering items that are a higher priority for our customers, the spokesperson said in a statement. This has resulted in some of our delivery promises being longer than usual.
At least Americans can still get non-essential items. (Which is to say, items outside the following departments: baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; groceries; and industrial, scientific, and pet supplies.) Thats not true in France or Italy any more, Krystal Hu reported at Reuters. The company has temporarily stopped taking orders for non-essential items that are shipped through its fulfillment service while it focuses on getting more important items to customers.
The company also suspended Prime Pantry, a service for getting rapid delivery of discounted grocery and household items, amid a surge in demand. And at the request of local governments it downgraded the quality of streaming on Prime Video in Europe in an effort to reduce the strain on the internet.
To be clear, Amazon has nothing to be ashamed of here. The company is navigating an extremely difficult period fraught with unpleasant trade-offs, and for the most part its supply chain has held up. The crisis has also spurred the company to (finally) recognize the everyday heroism of the workers in its distribution and delivery networks, who continue to put themselves at risk to keep America stocked up with necessities. As of Saturday, the company increased wages by $2 an hour and is offering double pay to workers who spend more than 40 hours on the job each week. And on Monday, the company finally agreed to provide paid time off for tens of thousands of warehouse employees.
Amazon has also said it will hire 100,000 new workers to help with increased demand amid the crisis, offering an equally important lifeline to a nation staring down the barrel of double-digit unemployment for the first time in recent memory.
In a memo to employees made public on Saturday, CEO Jeff Bezos said he is fully committed to addressing the COVID-19 challenge:
My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role. I want you to know Amazon will continue to do its part, and we wont stop looking for new opportunities to help.
One thing that could be helpful in this time is for Amazon to regularly brief the public on the health of its distribution networks and its expectations for any service interruptions in the immediate future. The company has historically worked to keep the media at greater than arms length, communicating primarily by press release. 
But the current crisis is changing the companys service so frequently, and with such high stakes, that a different approach is needed. One model Amazon might consider is that of Facebook, which over the past couple years began hosting regular briefings on subjects in the news. (There have been a lot about Russia, misinformation, and election security, for example.) Last week, the company held a briefing on its coronavirus response, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg took questions from the press.
If it undertook similar measures, Amazon could build confidence in its services. The alternative a torturous drip of news about service disruptions, delivered at odds hours across various news outlets who manage to get a response back from the companys public relations team has made for a grim status quo. It is not an approach that bears the hallmarks of customer obsession.
If you pay for Amazon Web Services, the company sells you guaranteed uptime if the service fails more than 0.01 percent of the time, you get a discount on future service. Already, some are speculating that Amazon will offer similar discounts to those affected by the understandable disruptions caused by COVID-19.
But theres something else the company could do, and it has the virtue of being basically free. It could regularly tell all its customers whats happening today, and what to expect tomorrow. If Bezos is right that things are going to get worse before they get better, as he told his employees, then his customers could use as much time as possible to begin contemplating their alternatives.

Despite a series of decisive victories in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona, Joe Bidens presidential campaign is struggling to move forward. Campaigning online and staying relevant during the coronavirus pandemic are two major hurdles. Heres Marc Caputo at Politico:
Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also cant meet with donors at fundraisers which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy thats sinking into recession or perhaps worse.
Its a tough position, said Matt Littman, whos hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software.
Its harder to raise money when theres no face-to-face meeting and personal contact, Littman said. And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I cant count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.

Industry
Instagram has prototyped an unreleased ephemeral messaging feature that clears the chat thread whenever you leave it. It looks a lot like Snapchats most popular feature. Josh Constine at TechCrunch has the scoop:
Instagram Stories caused Snapchat to start shrinking at one point, but now its growing healthily again. That may signaled that Instagram still had more work to do to steal Snaps thunder. But Instagrams existing version of ephemeral messaging that is clunkier, Facebook scrapped a trial of a similar feature, and WhatsApps take that started testing in October hasnt rolled out yet.
Thats left teens to stick with Snapchat for fast-paced communication they dont have to worry about coming back to haunt them. If Instagram successfully copies this feature too, it could reduce the need for people to stay on Snapchat while making Instagram Direct more appealing to a critical audience. Every reply and subsequent alert draws users deeper into Facebooks web.

In a normal year, fourth-year medical students across the United States would have some downtime in April. They would have already found out where theyll be doing their residencies and should have the whole month or more to coast through to graduation and the start of their medical careers in the summer. 
But this isnt a normal year, and a handful of medical schools around the country are offering to let students graduate early so they can join the fight against COVID-19. The Grossman School of Medicine at New York University was the first to do so. Eligible students whod already met graduation requirements could become doctors a few months ahead of schedule if they agreed to join the emergency or internal medicine departments at NYUs hospital. 
Gaby Mayer is one of the dozens of NYU students who volunteered to graduate early. (Full disclosure: shes also my friend.) Shed first heard that early graduation might be an option a few weeks ago when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo mentioned the possibility at a press conference. We werent sure if it would really get there, but we knew that other countries that were getting hit hard by COVID-19 were entertaining similar plans, she says. 
Now that its official, she says shes relieved that she can help. 
This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
How did you feel when you were officially asked to graduate early?
Wed all been talking about it informally as medical students. We really felt like a lot of us were sitting around doing a lot of nothing between now and graduation. We were feeling really happy to have a skill set where we could go into the hospital and relieve some of the strain. The first response was relief and, in some ways, excitement.
I think Id be remiss to not say I was a little nervous. The prospect of becoming a doctor for the first time is always going to be overwhelming, and theres a big learning curve at the beginning. To be learning in this hectic environment is certainly an additional challenge, but I think were ready for it. 
What are you doing to prepare for COVID-19, specifically? 
Ive been keeping up with case reports and keeping an eye on the medical literature. Now, Ill dive in a bit more. Since the announcement, a lot of us have put together a plan for the next few weeks less about COVID-19, but more about how well be transitioning our role in the hospital. 
What will your role be in the hospital during the outbreak?
Im not sure how much of what Ill be doing will be different from what I would have been doing in my first year. But normally, wed be there to keep parts of patient care moving forward so they receive appropriate care. Were the first ones to see patients in the morning, we coordinate consults between the different areas of medicine, write notes on patients, and keep the closest eye on them. We do that so the senior medical staff, whos closely supervising us, can both teach us about things like diagnoses but also so they can have room to think about the higher-level plan. 
The dean mentioned that we wouldnt be seeing intubated or medically complex patients, so my guess is that theyll try to keep us out of COVID-19 areas. But its hard to say for sure. 
How does it feel to enter medicine and become a doctor right now?
I feel really prepared. I wouldnt have volunteered if I felt in any way that I wouldnt be able to serve my patients. I think Im going to have to adjust my expectations, but there wont be a lot of adjusting of the core things I need to be a good doctor. 
I think I am a little nervous, of course. A big part of [the first year of residency] is about having a strong team to walk you through this new identity and new role. I think Im a little bit nervous about whether well get the same attention. Well get the same supervision in terms of patient care, but this is all happening in a crazy environment. 
But the biggest feeling I have is one of gratitude that I can help. Im really committed to patient care. Its the reason I went to medical school, and it keeps me really grounded. To be able to come back to that is a gift in a time when things are so crazy.

Those mutations aren’t cause for concern, and so far, don’t appear to be making the virus any more or less dangerous. But scientists can use those slight changes to track the virus from person to person, and location to location. “If we identify a new outbreak cluster in one state, and there’s a question of whether it’s related to a previous cluster or not, the small mutational changes can help you figure out if they’re connected,” says Patrick Boyle, a synthetic biologist at Ginkgo Bioworks. The coronavirus is made up of around 29,000 building blocks of genetic material called nucleotides. Like other biotechnology companies and labs, Ginkgo has the technology to take a sample of the virus and read out the full sequence of those nucleotides. For the most part, the sequence will be the same in each sample. But the virus makes copies of itself within a human host, and sometimes, it can make mistakes — switching one or two nucleotides out for another. The version of the virus with those changes can then be passed on when that person infects someone else. Ginkgo is repurposing its systems, which normally don’t sequence viruses, to analyze as many samples of the coronavirus as possible. The goal is to help build out the maps that show how the virus jumped from one person to the next. They’re hoping to scale up to be able to publish the full genetic sequence of 10,000 virus samples a day. This is awesome. I know groups that currently have samples in need of sequencing. I'll let them know about @Ginkgo 's offer. — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 24, 2020 Despite the skyrocketing numbers of COVID-19 cases in the US, only a limited number of virus samples collected in the country have been sequenced in full. Scientists have more sequences from Washington state than other places. Consequently, they know more about the trajectory of the outbreak in Washington than they know about outbreaks in other states. Some of that genetic data is how Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was able to link a case of COVID-19 diagnosed on February 27 in Washington to a case that was diagnosed in late January in the state — indicating that the virus had been circulating locally, and undetected, for that entire time. It also showed that the January case sparked a cluster of illnesses that spread through the community. Other states are starting to do the same kind of detective work, using genetic sequences to help clarify their outbreaks. An analysis of nine virus samples collected in Connecticut showed that the some were related to viruses found in Washington state, which suggests that the coronavirus was spreading domestically, not being repeatedly brought in from other countries. The analysis has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. Other preliminary research examined virus samples from northern California, and found that the coronavirus was introduced to the area at multiple points. New preprint from the @NathanGrubaugh lab. Here we sequenced 9 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from early cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut. The majority of the genomes clustered with other sequences from the U.S., suggesting spread across the country (thread) https://t.co/jCeyC48ExS pic.twitter.com/WIauOEUenU — Joseph Fauver (@JosephFauver) March 28, 2020 One challenge in expanding the number of virus sequences available, Boyle says, is obtaining patient samples to analyze. Labs in the US and other countries that are running tests for the virus receive hundreds or thousands of patient samples each day. But the focus of those labs is checking a sample to see if the coronavirus is there — and the patient has COVID-19 — or if it isn’t. The emphasis on testing and diagnosing patients is critical to track the pandemic, Boyle says. “The problem is, it only gives you a positive or negative answer,” he says. Tests don’t provide any extra information about the particular virus in each patient. Ginkgo plans to partner with testing labs, so that they can take a closer look at the virus in a patient sample after the testing is done. Other labs and groups worldwide are embarking on similar projects: a research consortium in the United Kingdom, for example, has over $20 million in funding to sequence samples. Boyle says that Gingko is coordinating with some other labs interested in this work. They’re also making sure that they can access the chemicals and other supplies they need to run the genetic analysis, Boyle says. “We want to make sure that our supply stream is not competing with the supply stream that keeps the testing running.” Expanding the number of coronavirus sequences available will give scientists a picture of the outbreak, in the US and around the world. Along with testing, it’s one way scientists can keep track of the virus’s movements — and help to rein it in."

The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here.
Most days in this column I try to bring you one big story about the intersection of tech and democracy, but reading the news today I find I cant draw any real lessons for you. Instead I see a few clusters of stories that feel worth reading and thinking about. Lets take a look.
The big story of the week continues to be the (tentative, premature) plans to begin re-opening society as states manage to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections. Ive already linked Ed Yongs masterful piece in The Atlantic here once this week, but if youre new to the subject its where Id start. Its the frame around everything else youll read about what big tech companies are doing in response to the pandemic, from sophisticated contact tracing solutions to old-fashioned philanthropy. 
The most important thing to take away from that piece, as well as several others I have read this week, is that there is not a coordinated federal plan to manage the next phase of the crisis. Instead we have a president who says he wants to end lockdowns as soon as possible, despite lacking the authority to do so, and groups of governors on both coasts pledging to work together to manage the process on a regional basis. This seems likely to cause not a small degree of chaos, working against efforts to contain new outbreaks and undermining the well intentioned tech initiatives that are now percolating.
And we cant blame all of this on politics: even epidemiologists disagree on what the best path forward is. Heres Kai Kupferschmidt in Science:
What is the exit strategy? Weve managed to get to the life raft, says epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). But Im really unclear how we will get to the shore.
As they seek a path forward, governments around the world must triangulate the health of their citizens, the freedoms of their population, and economic constraints. Could schools be reopened? Restaurants? Bars? Can people go back to their offices? How to relax the lockdown is not something around which there is a scientific consensus, says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at HSPH. Most researchers agree that reopening society will be a long haul, marked by trial and error. Its going to have to be something that were going to have to take baby steps with, says Megan Coffee, an infectious disease researcher at New York University.
This uncertainty has huge implications for public health and the eventual recovery of the economy. And in the shorter term, it raises questions about how effective the Apple/Google collaboration on contact tracing will be, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman explores in The Verge today: 
The pandemic is moving at unprecedented speed, and public health experts are sprinting to build the tools they think might help bring it under control. Its a little bit of flying the plane while still building it, Dhillon says. Any automated contact tracing program would have to be carefully monitored to see how well it helps contain COVID-19, how people are interacting with it, and if its flagging more people than actually would be at risk from an exposure.
Whatever the systems eventually end up looking like, they have to be introduced alongside public health infrastructure to ensure they have as big an impact as possible. The tools cant be used in isolation, Liu says. You have to make sure you have the policies in place to support them. 
It seems likely that we will have those policies in place in California. But with President Trump framing the recovery as a partisan battle against Democratic governors, and people protesting stay-at-home orders already taking to the streets in Michigan, its hard to imagine an environment in which a coherent national response emerges.
A good question for tech giants right now is: what would you build in response to the pandemic if you knew there would never be a coordinated federal response? Are your interventions resilient to partisan warfare? Can they be?

A lesser concern: is Amazon getting stronger during the pandemic, or weaker?
On the stronger side, America is suddenly hugely dependent on the deliveries that Amazon provides. A huge number of local retail businesses may not survive the next several months, putting Amazon in an even stronger position to dominate e-commerce once the pandemic subsides. Jason Del Rey wrote about this possibility Friday at Recode: 
And then theres Amazon, which already accounted for nearly 40 percent of all US online retail sales thats around eight times more than its next competitor, Walmart. Before the pandemic, the US e-commerce industry only represented between 10 percent and 15 percent of overall retail. Now, that percentage seems likely to grow, setting up Amazon to have a bigger advantage over most other retailers, including Walmart.
With millions of Americans ordered to remain home, Amazon is now, more than ever, a lifeline for essentials for millions of people rather than just a convenient option for online shopping. Consumer spending on Amazon is up 35 percent from the same period last year, according to estimates from Facteus, a firm that analyzes more than 30 million daily payment card transactions to offer consumer spending insights to retailers and financial institutions. The labor numbers also reflect the companys growth; Amazon has hired 80,000 new workers in the past few weeks alone.
This seems to me to be a fairly airtight case that Amazon will come out of the pandemic stronger than before. At the same time, have you noticed how much of the company is in disarray? Each day brings a new story of COVID 19-related worker unrest, illness, or even death. Workers involved in organizing efforts have been fired in what they describe as retaliation. (Amazon denies they were fired for speaking out.) On Wednesday, France ordered the company to shutter its six warehouses in the country for several days to better assess the risk for contagion among its workforce there.
Its clear that these issues have had a significant effect on the quality of Amazons services during this time, as you may have noticed from the multi-week delays in receiving shipments of non-essential items and the nearly impossible task of ordering grocery delivery. (The company is currently adding new customers seeking grocery deliveries to a waitlist.)
I expect all those issues to get resolved in time, particularly as the company brings on board the tens of thousands of new workers it plans to hire. But I do wonder how the companys reputation for exploiting its workforce will haunt it as America re-opens. Theres already a significant swath of Americans who wont shop at Walmart over labor issues. I can imagine Amazon finding itself in a similar place among more wealthy and informed consumers assuming those consumers have any good alternatives to shop at.

Finally: Zoom is an amazing tool for the moment. But while its equal to many tasks, its not ideal for almost any of them. 
Women in business meetings on Zoom find that it can be impossible to get a word in edgewise with the men.

Attendees of Zoom parties stare dead-eyed at the screen wondering if or when to speak.
I dont blame Zoom for not building software to address these and other shortcomings of video-chat based socializing. But it sure would be great if someone else did.

Verily, the Google sister company that launched a COVID-19 screening and testing program last month, told US lawmakers that its user data wont be used for commercial purposes or sold to third parties. But it also admitted its screening site is not in compliance with the HIPAA privacy rule. Heres Hugh Langley at Business Insider:
Verily has focused on the protection of the security and privacy of personal health information since the inception of its Baseline COVID-19 Program, the company wrote. With respect to its Baseline COVID-19 Program, Verily is not acting as a covered entity or a business associate as defined by HIPAA. As the Program expands, we will continue to prioritize the protection of individual health data. However, in the future if we engage in a program where we do become a covered entity or we are required to sign a BAA we will take all the appropriate steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA.

The Pentagons inspector general could not definitively determine whether the White House interfered with the procurement process for the JEDI contract because senior Defense Department officials were barred from answering verbal questions on the subject. Amazon sued the Defense Department last year, alleging that the Pentagon made several mistakes in its evaluation of bids. Heres Politicos Jacqueline Feldscher:
Trump repeatedly inserted himself into the JEDI review process in ways that presidents traditionally dont. In July, Trump said he would be asking the Pentagon to look at it very closely to see whats going on because he heard complaints about the review process from companies and lawmakers. Shortly after, the Pentagon put a contract award on hold so Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had recently taken the job, could review allegations that Amazon had been unfairly given an advantage for the contract.

The company offered an update on its fight against harmful misinformation today, announcing the launch of a couple of new features for promoting accurate news. One of these is a box that will appear for people who liked, reacted to, or commented on a post that Facebook later removed, encouraging them to visit the World Health Organization’s site. Facebook is separately launching a “Get the Facts” section full of vetted news about the pandemic. Today’s update follows a scathing report by nonprofit group Avaaz, which called the site an “epicenter of coronavirus misinformation” and cited numerous posts containing dangerous health advice and fake cures. The company pushed back on this accusation, saying it’s removed “hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation” in the past weeks. For milder content that doesn’t merit full removal, it cited statistics suggesting warning labels have a real effect: when people see the warning, they don’t click through to the original content 95 percent of the time. (We don’t know precisely how that compares to the normal clickthrough rate.) Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran told Politico that “Facebook should be proud of this step” to add new features, “but the step doesn’t reflect the full gamut of what we would like to see them do.” I want to share an update on the work we're doing to connect people with accurate information and limit the spread of... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, April 16, 2020 Facebook has warned users that they’ve engaged with misinformation before, opening a portal for people to check if they’d liked or followed Russian propaganda pages. The pop-up strategy is more proactive, though. And the message that Facebook shared seems subtler and less judgmental. If anything, it seems designed to avoid even telling people they fell for a fake story. Instead, it urges them to “help friends and family avoid false information about COVID-19” by sharing a link to the World Health Organization’s website."

Goldenvoice added that the festival would be postponed until October 2020, and that any purchases for the original dates would be honored for the rescheduled weekend. Goldenvoice will notify purchasers by March 13 about refunds.

""There's a calendar to launch more 5G cities over the next quarter, [but] we're not doing marketing launches right now just because of everything that's going on,"" she says. ""We're on track for the additional 30 this year, and we continue to expand coverage in the 30 that we launched last year. In Chicago, we have three times the nodes we did a year ago.""
Verizon's 5G launched almost exactly a year ago in Chicago and Minneapolis. In Chicago at the time, coverage was restricted only to a few sites in the city center. If Verizon's current coverage map is to be believed, it now covers the entire Loop, West Loop, and River North areas, as well as major avenues in much of the rest of the city.
AT&amp;T last announced a 5G expansion about a month ago, just as the COVID lockdowns were beginning, saying that it was expanding its low-band 5G from 80 to 100 markets. T-Mobile's president of technology Neville Ray said on April 1 that his carrier was rolling out mid-band 5G in Philadelphia, although he stopped short of calling it a launch.
Because of its very short range, Verizon's millimeter-wave 5G system is harder to set up (but faster) than the low-band and mid-band systems the other carriers have been most recently touting. Verizon will also get mid-band 5G using dynamic spectrum sharing, splitting existing frequency bands with 4G, ""probably during the third quarter of this year,"" Hemmer says.
New ""intelligent beamforming"" software will help with range from the millimeter-wave base stations, Hemmer says. In early March, I estimated those have about an 800-foot radius right now. Fortunately, Verizon won't need to do any more hardware swaps to increase its range, but it's waiting on that software, she says, without giving a time frame for it to show up.
COVID-19 lockdowns present a unique challenge for wireless carriers and ISPs. Their work is considered essentialthese are the networks the rest of us rely on for work and school. It turns out that in cities where Verizon's crews can stay outside, laying fiber and planting millimeter-wave 5G hardware on lampposts and light poles, they're actually finding it easier going because of clear streets. That's the rollout style we've seen in Chicago and Providence.
""When we're outside and we're attaching to city furniture, for the most part we're able to continue that work,"" Hemmer says. ""In some cases we have cities where the streets don't have traffic on them ... and a couple of cities have given us wider construction hours.""
But cities where the carrier needs access to building rooftops, such as I've seen in New York and Dallas, are more on hold to keep Verizon's staff safe. Access to buildings can also be a problem when landlords are locked down or absent. ""Right now we're choosing not to put our employees inside multi-dwelling units,"" Hemmer says.
That caution extends to testing and development labs as well. Hemmer says Verizon is doing as much ""remote testing"" as it can with its equipment providers to minimize the number of engineers it needs to send into the office. ""We do have labs we own, and they go in every day, but we send in the minimum amount of people, we do deep cleaning, and we don't have anyone flying in,"" she says.
The most recent data from our sibling company Ookla Speedtest shows that US internet networks are, by and large, holding up under the strain of the COVID-19 period.

Chinese operatives helped amplify a viral text message that falsely claimed President Trump was going to instate a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, reports The New York Times. US officials said the operatives were engaging in disinformation tactics similar to the ones Russia used in 2016.
The rumor, which gained traction around mid-March, claimed to be coming from someone close to the White House. It said Trump was doing to lock down the country to stop the spread of COVID-19. Please be advised, one version of the text message began. Within 48 to 72 hours the President will evoke what is called the Stafford Act. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.
On March 15th, the White House National Security Council debunked the myth in a tweet, saying: Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.
Operatives created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it
While Chinese operatives did not create the message, intelligence agencies in the United States determined that they helped circulate it across different platforms, including on Facebook and over SMS. Those efforts enabled the messages to catch the attention of enough people that they then spread on their own, with little need for further work by foreign agents, the NYT reports.
In some cases, the agents created fake social media accounts to promote the message to people who were predisposed to believe it. Those people then sent it out to their networks, allowing the myth to gain traction.
The lockdown rumor isnt the first coronavirus myth that has been linked to China. Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, spread misinformation that the coronavirus may not have originated in Wuhan, and was instead brought by the US military. CDC was caught on the spot, he tweeted on March 12th. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied that they had anything to do with the viral text message, telling the NYT,The relevant statements are complete nonsense and not worth refuting."

Nuro, the autonomous vehicle startup founded by two ex-Google engineers, is using its small fleet of road-legal delivery robots to transport medical supplies around two California stadiums that have been converted into treatment facilities for people stricken with COVID-19. 
The coronavirus pandemic has forced self-driving car companies in California to temporarily shutdown their operations and ground their fleets, thanks to shelter-in-place orders that ban nonessential transportation. But Nuro realized it could still play a role in delivering goods for health care workers by using its R2 prototype vehicles. These lightweight electric vehicles are built from the ground up to be completely driverless and, with slight alterations, could also provide contactless delivery, said Dave Ferguson, CEO of Nuro. 
Robots are not solving this crisis
Robots are not solving this crisis, Ferguson said in an interview with The Verge. But by providing truly contactless delivery of goods Nuro can help provide essential supplies to frontline health care workers who are fighting the virus. Thats actually very beneficial for both parties [by] drastically reducing all possibility of contagion, he said. 
Nuros robots are ferrying food, personal protective equipment (PPE), clean linens, and other supplies to workers at two facilities in California: the Event Center in San Mateo and the Sleep Train Arena, which is typically home to the Sacramento Kings. Both facilities have been converted into field hospitals to handle the overflow of patients who have contracted COVID-19. 
Human workers load and unload the vehicles at either end of the route. Typically, Nuros vehicles require the delivery recipient to input a code on a touchscreen to make the doors open. But to make it truly contactless, workers are only required to give a thumbs-up to the vehicles camera and a Nuro operator monitoring the live feed will open the doors remotely. 
One of Nuros vehicles will be operating inside the Sleep Train Arena, making deliveries to workers at either end of the facility. The transport that were doing reduces the amount of transport that otherwise would need to be done by the healthcare staff, Ferguson said. This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area.
This is where all the COVID patients are, so this is effectively a very high risk exposure area
The vehicles at both locations are on fixed, preplanned routes on private roads, which minimizes the chance theyll encounter anything too complicated. While they are capable of traveling up to 25 mph, the R2 vehicles will be limited to 5 mph outdoors and 2.5 mph indoors. 
This represents a significant shift to Nuros typical operations, which are focused on grocery and food delivery in Arizona and Texas. In addition to a small number of R2 vehicles, the company also conducts deliveries using its fleet of retrofitted Toyota Priuses with two safety drivers in each. But due to social distancing rules, the company is only using one safety driver per vehicle for its delivery routes in Arizona and Texas, and is mostly operating its vehicle manually. Testing in California has been temporarily halted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place rules.
The company also has the distinction of being the first autonomous vehicle operator to receive a federal exemption to mass-produce driverless vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or sideview mirrors. Nuro also was recently approved to test its driverless delivery robots on public roads in California becoming only the second company to receive such a permit.
The pandemic has made it an extremely precarious time for self-driving car companies, especially those that have been unable to secure enough funding to sustain their operations through an extended shutdown. But Ferguson said that Nuro has so far been able to avoid layoffs and furloughs by developing tools that allow its operations team to contribute remotely from their homes, as well as investing in simulation that allows it to continue running its vehicle tests in a virtual world. (The companys nearly $1 billion from SoftBank probably didnt hurt to have either.)
Were feeling pretty good about this this being within our control, Ferguson said, and its sort of up to us to execute and make it happen."

 Amazon tech workers are calling out sick today in protest of the company’s treatment of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The action, which will consist of a live streamed series of speakers in lieu of a physical rally, is a sign that the protests at Amazon’s warehouses have galvanized portions of the company’s white-collar workforce. 
The protest is in part a result of Amazon’s aggressive response to worker organizing. In recent weeks, Amazon has fired six workers who have called for better safety precautions during the pandemic, including two long-time user experience designers. Both were prominent members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and had publicly voiced support for improving warehouse conditions. The two tech workers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, were fired shortly after a colleague sent an email inviting employees to an online event featuring warehouse workers speaking about their experience. (That employee had already given his two-weeks’ notice but had his network access terminated, Costa says.) More than 1,500 employees RSVP’d to the event, but it was quickly deleted from their calendars along with the email. 
“I was so shocked, I was shaking,” says Costa, who spent 15 years at the company and was fired in a brief video call. Costa says the HR representative told her she had violated the company’s non-solicitation policy, possibly referring to an email about warehouse working conditions she and Cunningham forwarded to colleagues in late March. She believes she was fired for speaking out, and that the firings show how threatened Amazon is by the prospect of its tech workforce collaborating with the warehouse employees from whom they are typically isolated. “They are absolutely siloed, and intentionally so,” Costa says. “Obviously, we tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”
In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company supports “every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies.” The spokesperson said Amazon terminated Cunningham and Costa for “repeatedly violating internal policies” but did not specify which ones. Amazon did not comment on the deleted emails and calendar events. 
“We tread on sacred ground when we had this brilliant idea to connect those two groups.”


The panel went forward and approximately 400 employees attended, along with warehouse workers from Minnesota, California, Poland, and elsewhere. But the firings prompted employees to organize a second event, this one a protest. “It’s like a walkout, but in the time of COVID, because we can’t really walk out together,” Costa says of the sick out. Instead, they will have a series of speakers — warehouse workers, as well as the writers Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben — discussing the pandemic, the climate crisis, racism, and Amazon’s retaliation against workers. It will be live streamed over the course of the day. “You can come for 10 minutes or stay for the day, or stay home and watch Friends reruns. We don’t care, but we actually have proper programming,” Costa says. 
“If they’re keeping everyone safe what do they have to hide?” 

The second event has also met with resistance from Amazon. Tuesday night, an employee emailed an invitation that was quickly deleted. A software engineer in Seattle who asked to remain anonymous “given Amazon’s recent history of retaliation” checked his email after receiving the invitation, only to have it vanish ten minutes later. He had found the earlier panel “eye opening,” particularly the disparity in how tech workers and warehouse workers are being treated during the pandemic: while he and his colleagues were sent home immediately after a coronavirus case was confirmed at Amazon’s headquarters, warehouse workers aren’t being informed when coworkers test positive and social distancing is haphazardly enforced. 
“Now that Amazon is firing tech workers for trying to connect with logistics workers, and going so far as to delete calendar invites to events where tech workers can hear directly about conditions from warehouse workers, it makes you wonder, if they’re keeping everyone safe, what do they have to hide?” the engineer says. 
Amazon has been vocal about the safety measures it has instituted over the course of the pandemic. In previous statements, the company has touted the “extreme measures” it has taken to keep its workers safe, including mandatory social distancing, increased cleaning, and more than a hundred other policy and operational changes. 
“It’s very clearly retaliation.” 

But workers say the safety measures have been far from adequate. Their jobs still frequently take them in close proximity to each other, and people are continuing to fall ill. Yesterday, workers at JFK8, the Staten Island fulfillment center that was the site of the first walkout, received a notification that seven employees had been newly diagnosed with COVID-19, bringing the total count to at least 27, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Amazon has declined to say how many workers at how many facilities have fallen ill, so workers and activists have been left to compile statistics from alerts and news reports. The group United for Respect says at least 130 facilities have confirmed coronavirus cases, some with more than 30 workers diagnosed with the virus. 
Amazon has a history of responding aggressively to worker organizing. Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that the company uses a heat map to predict which Whole Foods locations are most likely to unionize. Yet the company has never needed workers more, as it races to hire tens of thousands of people to meet surging demand and replace workers who have chosen to stay home. The result has been a dissonant public response. After workers at JFK8 walked out, Amazon fired the organizer, dismissed the protesters’ claims — and then made many of the changes they had called for. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed executives planning to smear the organizer, Christian Smalls, and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.” Throughout, Amazon has publicly referred to its workers as “heroes.” 
The company has fired outspoken workers at warehouses in Minnesota and Pennsylvania as well. Amazon denies these firings are connected to the workers’ activism, pointing instead to policy violations. But employees say policies are being selectively enforced to target organizers. After workers walked out in Chicago, several of them were given write-ups for violating a 6-foot social distancing rule, even though the impossibility of maintaining social distancing in the warehouse was part of the reason they were protesting. (Employees at the facility filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, which is looking into the claims.) “All the reasons they’re giving for write-ups are issues that occur daily, but they’re only targeting people who participated in the action,” a worker there says. “It’s very clearly retaliation.” 
“Have backbone; disagree and commit.”

That worker is optimistic about the sick out. “I think that’s great organizing to connect tech and warehouse workers. We all have the same employer, just different workplaces and conditions,” he says. “They’re broadening the perspective on how to organize and how to collaborate with warehouse workers, and Amazon sees that and is attacking them for that.”
In the past, Amazon has been more tolerant of dissent among its tech workers, opting for warnings rather than terminations. That appears to have changed in recent weeks, with the firing of Costa and Cunningham. But it’s unclear whether this will be a sustainable strategy for Amazon. The company’s warehouse system is highly regimented in a way that makes workers easy to replace, all the more so in a bad economy. The job market for engineers is far more competitive; they have more leverage, and can leave more easily. 
“I’ve also seen many co-workers respond with outrage and dismay at the company’s retaliation against workers who’ve tried to sound the alarm on safety,” says the Seattle engineer. “Amazon claims to value dissent, but they’ve tried to silence workers to protect their own image — that goes against everything tech workers are taught about leadership.” (One of the company’s fourteen leadership principles is “Have backbone; disagree and commit.”) 
“It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”

“Tech workers aren’t used to being threatened by their employer, emails and calendar invites deleted when Amazon wants to silence someone, firing long-time senior employees to save face,” the engineer says. “It shocked a lot of people. It’s going to make us all question whether or not we still want to work here.”
Costa plans to continue her activism from the outside, both on climate and workers’ rights, which she sees as intertwined. Despite her firing, she still thinks like a long-time employee — talking about Amazon, she kept referring to the company with “we,” before catching herself, and she expresses chagrin at what she sees as a squandered opportunity in Amazon’s coronavirus response. 
“No company is benefiting more than Amazon right now, the stock is hitting an all-time high, and they could have also been the hero in people’s hearts, they could have set the bar high for how you treat essential workers in the time of COVID,” she says. “I really was trying to make Amazon a better company, for my kids, and for the company I worked for for 15 years.”"

That's because, due to a woeful lack of testing in the nation, no one knows how many Americans are infected and the resulting respiratory disease (COVID-19) is 10times more lethal than the flu. Sunday morning, Marc Lipsitch, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard University, emphasized this point, noting that the true number of infections is certainly ""much higher"" than confirmed cases.
But, though some folks are social distancing, many still clearly aren't. Some are even actively bragging about not doing it. This weekend, journalists and others reported that bars across the nation were packed in Boston, Chicago, Nashville, and New York City.
For those eager to ignore the recommendations of scientists who have squelched deadly virus epidemics in the past like immunologist Mark Cameron who helped put SARS to rest consider this: Between 20 to 60 percent of adults globally are expected to become infected, and some 15 percent of cases are severe or critical. It is people over 60 who are most vulnerable. So stopping the virus' spread will help your older relatives or parents from falling extremely ill, or worse. 
""Social distancing is based on the principle of altruism,"" Jason Farley, a nurse practitioner for the Division of Infectious Diseases AIDS Service at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told Mashable last week. ""Treating everyone around you like its your 80-year-old grandmother is the circumstance we need to think about.""
Many people perhaps unaware they can walk around infected but without any symptoms for some five days or longer clearly aren't considering the societal notion of altruism during a pandemic:
I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I'm 30.
It was delicious, and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I'll do what I want.

Social distancing is not alarmist. In the words of Michael Leavitt, the former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:
""Everything we do before a pandemic will seem alarmist. Everything we do after a pandemic will seem inadequate. This is the dilemma we face, but it should not stop us from doing what we can to prepare.""
""Social distancing goes a long way to prevent the rapid spread of the virus,"" Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, told Mashable. 
""Social distancing is one of the most effective tools,"" agreed Suzanne Willard, a global health expert at Rutgers School of Nursing.

It's true that social distancing is not the only critical tool. A prompt and radical uptick in testing to isolate and treat infected people is paramount. But social distancing will limit the spread of coronavirus, a disease so infectious it has traveled the globe.
""It takes an unprecedented public health response to put a lid on this one,"" said Cameron, who researches infectious diseases at Case Western Reserve University.

And nowhere are things bleaker than in the toilet paper aisle.
As CNN reported, retailers are struggling to keep TP in stock as people across the country hoard the stuff to prepare for the possibility of quarantine due to the spread of COVID-19. (That's the World Health Organization's official term for the respiratory disease caused by the virus.) In some areas, this panic-buying has gotten so out of control that stores have begun limiting the number of packs customers can purchase at one time.
To be clear: Toilet paper can't protect you against the coronavirus, nor is the need for it expected to soar as people spend more time practicing social distancing at home. Nevertheless, ""stockpiling is not an uncommon reaction provoked by fear,"" points out Todd C. Frankel, a reporter on The Washington Post's Finance desk, citing interviews with social scientists. ""Fear of running out. Fear of the unknown and what is to come.""

If your home is feeling eerily quiet right now (mine certainly is), then there's one solution that can really help right now: podcasts. 
You can play chatty, cheerful podcasts either on a low volume as background noise, or louder if you want to give them your full attention. You don't need to feel like you're living in A Quiet Place, right now. And you don't need to fill that silence with rolling news coverage if it's having an adverse effect on your mental health.
Inject some positive vibes into your home with the following chatty podcasts. 
Each episode, singer Jessie Ware and her mum Lennie cook up a storm and host a dinner party with a celebrity, including the likes of Sam Smith, Nigella Lawson, Emilia Clarke, and HAIM. The format makes for absolutely delightful listening. It's basically like being a fly on the wall at an A-list dinner party where the food is absolutely top-notch. If you love food and a good natter, then this is right up your street. My fave episode features Alan Carr chatting about Adele hosting his wedding. 
If you're missing your friends right now, then The Receipts Podcast will make you feel like you're sitting with your mates. The Receipts is hosted by three women Tolani (Tolly) Shoneye, Audrey Indome, and Milena Sanchez  who chat about relationship dilemmas and dramas in a hilarious in a hilarious, unfiltered way. As Indome once put it, the podcast is ""an unfiltered girl chat, its a WhatsApp group chat come to life.""

This is a potent social distancing measure, which means keeping at least three feet away from someone, or avoiding crowds. Infectious disease experts, including those who have helped stamp out deadly epidemics before, say social distancing is imperative to slow the inevitable spread of coronavirus, which results in the respiratory disease COVID-19.
""We will be issuing an order closing all bars and restaurants in #Ohio beginning at 9:00 tonight,"" DeWine, a Republican, tweeted on Sunday afternoon. 
""Every day we delay, more people will die,"" DeWine continued. ""If we do not act and get some distance between people, our healthcare system in #Ohio will not hold up. The loss won't only be those impacted by #COVID19, but the danger is also to everyone else who needs hospital care for other issues.""
(Illinois, meanwhile, announced on Sunday that it will close ""inside dining"" for two weeks.)
DeWine's effort intends to reduce strain on hospitals which can't care for the coming rise in severely sick people, particularly folks over 60. Ohioans can still get their restaurant-fix via takeout, and buy beer from stores. 
Due to a woeful lack of testing in the U.S., it's still unknown how many people are infected with coronavirus, but top epidemiologists know the number is ""much higher"" than just the reported cases. There are over 3,200 confirmed cases so far in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, with 37 confirmed in Ohio. 
The glaring problem with bars is that coronavirus doesn't make people sick quickly. So people show up to socialize unaware they're infected. Around 80 percent of us experience milder symptoms or no symptoms at all. People might not even know they're sick for some five days.

Kathleen, a 25-year-old in Philadelphia, is having the same issue as Martinez only with her roommates. The digital marketing specialist, who requested to be referred to by her first name only for privacy concerns, said she started taking the crisis seriously before traveling to Ireland the first week of March. 
""She would make comments like 'it's just the flu' or 'the government is making a big deal out of this.'""
She returned stateside on March 15, and told me that her roommates have only begun to feel moderately concerned last week. As of March 30, Philadelphia has over 1,000 
confirmed cases of COVID-19, the official name for the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Even though her roommates are moderately concerned, Kathleen believes they are not taking precautions. One of them works at a grocery store and, according to Kathleen, does not take proper steps against bringing home germs. Her other roommate has not adhered to social distancing by going shopping more than necessary and visiting family and friends. 
Kathleen told Mashable that she does not leave the house aside for a few walks, and is growing increasingly nervous when it comes to her roommates. 
Similar to Kathleen, Erika, a 28-year-old woman in Florida, is living with people not taking coronavirus seriously. In her case, it's her in-laws, who go outside to shop three times a day according to Erika. 
Erika, who requested to go by another name to keep her privacy, and her husband, a coach in the NCAA, realized the situation was serious when sporting events were canceled. Her in-laws, who are over 75, as well as her husband's 93-year-old grandmother, were already visiting them from out-of-state. When the situation got worse in their home state, they decided to stay with Erika and her husband indefinitely. 
""We are not in a state on lockdown and most stores are still open,"" Erika told me, ""so we think this contributes to their reluctance to change their daily routines.""
There are a multitude of reasons why a loved one or roommate may not take the pandemic seriously, according to Dr. Katherine M. Hertlein
. Hertlein, a professor with the couple and family therapy program within the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' School of Medicine, told Mashable that past experiences, defensiveness, or an ability to be highly adaptable in many situations can be some reasons behind someone not taking extra precautions.

Furthermore, it may be hard for people to grasp something they cannot see. ""We're evolved to learn from personal experience, not from statistics and theory,"" Viktor Sander, counselor at SocialPro
, told Mashable. ""These individuals usually change their minds when they have a personal experience to draw conclusions from."" That means, unfortunately, they would change their mind if someone close to them or they themselves were diagnosed with coronavirus. 
Martinez does not understand his significant other's blasé attitude towards COVID-19, given that she works in a clinic that tests blood samples. ""I figured this would be something she would take more serious [sic],"" he said. 
""There are things she does that makes me take a step back and think if this is the hill I wanna die on when I notice something irresponsible,"" he continued. This includes washing her hands for only five seconds (the CDC recommends 20 seconds
) and not treating hand-washing as a priority after being in public, say at the grocery store. 
""It's hard because I notice these things and don't want to call her out on it each time because it's annoying for me and I'm sure she'll get annoyed with me,"" said Martinez. ""For now I have been biting my tongue for most of the time but if I feel the need to speak up, I will tell her straight up.""
While it's not possible to control someone's beliefs or actions, there are some steps one can take to try to convince or help convince them of the coronavirus's severity. 
""These individuals usually change their minds when they have a personal experience to draw conclusions from.""
A common mistake is to end up in an argument, according to Sander. This can make it seem like you and your partner or roommate or whomever are no longer on the same ""team."" Rather, Sander suggested that you bring empathy and understanding into the conversation. What do you agree with them on? Let them know. 
""Now that you are in the same camp so to speak, you can give factual arguments for why it can still be good to wash your hands, avoid contact, or self-isolate,"" said Sander. For example, you can tell your partner you know the risk of you yourself being in danger is low, but taking actions like thoroughly washing hands and social distancing can save other lives. 
This goes into another tactic that Dr. Hertlein suggested: appealing to their sense of being a responsible partner. ""Convince them that it is important to YOU and your well-being,"" Dr. Hertlein said, ""and that while the pandemic might not be important, the relationship and the partner who is cautious are certainly important."" 
Dr. Rebecca Cowan, core faculty member in Walden Universitys MS in clinical mental health counseling
 program, had similar advice: Have a discussion about your concerns, but don't point fingers. ""Attempt to come to a mutual agreement about how you plan to cohabitate throughout the coronavirus pandemic,"" Cowan told Mashable. ""It is best to have this conversation as soon as possible to reduce unnecessary stress and tension.""

It's difficult to upend one's life to begin with; add in the uncertainty of when we can ""return to normal"" (whatever normal may even be), and one may be empathetic to the hesitation and fear that goes into wanting to pretend everything is normal. As the pandemic and governmental responses unfold, however, those who did not take it seriously now may soon change their attitudes. 
Deep down, Erika believes her in-laws are scared and changing their routines is a scary concept admitting the problem is real. 
""Hard to say but we really wish theyd be more careful,"" Erika said. ""We want to stay safe and we want them healthy."""

The tweet, which quoted another tweet from right-wing personality Charlie Kirk, falsely claimed that the drug hydroxychloroquine, which is used to treat lupus, arthritis, and malaria, has ""a 100% effective rate treating COVID-19."" This is not true: Despite Donald Trump's enthusiasm for the drug, there is still only anecdotal evidence that it can effectively treat coronavirus.
The tweet also alleged that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer is ""the latest Democrat to ban doctors from prescribing the lifesaving drugs hydroxychloroquine and Z-Paks to save senior citizens in the state."" (Trump has specifically touted the combination of hydroxychloroquine and axythromycin which is sold as Zithromax, or a Z-Pak as a treatment; again, there is not clinical evidence to support his excitement.)

This is also misleading. Rather, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs is warning doctors not to hoard or prescribe hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine inappropriately, which could cause a shortage for people who need them for other conditions. 
Many lupus patients, for instance, have no other options for medication, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.
Twitter confirmed via email that Giuliani's account was temporarily locked for violating the platform's rules regarding Covid-19 misinformation. Those rules specifically prohibit ""content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information,"" including ""description of treatments or protective measures which ... are being shared with the intent to mislead others.""

This came after an extended beta period which saw the app slowly roll out in the UK and Australia. In case the name didn't make it clear, it's a special version of Spotify made for kids, specifically ages three and up.
We'll get the bad news out of the way first: You need a Spotify Premium Family subscription to access Spotify Kids. That's $15 per month, which will understandably be too much for some families.

Now for the good news. Assuming you use the North American version, you'll get access to 8,000 songs as well as audiobook and fairy tale content from the likes of Disney, among others. For bedtime, there's a selection of nighttime stories, lullabies, and ambient music to lull those restless kiddos to sleep at the end of another quarantined day.
Rounding out the list are educational songs, sponsored playlists from movies like Frozen 2, and special playlists for Spanish-language music and Christian music in the U.S. app. Before you ask, yes, it's all hand-selected by a team of curators. Spotify isn't trusting the sanity of you and your children to questionable algorithms.

This was just the beginning of a range of ""challenges""
 and chain messages that have popped up across different social media platforms, as everyone is as Tyga and Curtis Roach so eloquently put it bored in the house
. 
As social distancing drags on, some adults are coping with viral Instagram challenges, chain emails, and gossiping about who is quarantining with whom. And, as has been widely discussed in the media already, many of them are even going back to their childhood homes to ride out the pandemic with their parents. 
But there are reasons these challenges are popping up that go well beyond boredom. It feels like we're all in high school again, a time in our lives where we didn't have the autonomy to go where we want, when we want. 
It feels like we're all in high school again, a time in our lives where we didn't have the autonomy to go where we want, when we want. 
Another way of saying autonomy is control, and we're all experiencing a loss of control right now. That may be one reason why we're putting photos on Instagram ""until tomorrow.""
""It's important to have control over our lives,"" said Dr. Katherine M. Hertlein
, a professor with the couple and family therapy program within the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' School of Medicine. ""And when we don't, we have to find ways to have control."" In an interview with Mashable, Hertlein compared what adults could be feeling now to the lack of control one feels as an adolescent, a period of discovery and figuring out what you do and do not have control over. 
Hertlein believes these trending challenges and the like are ways that we can establish some control while maintaining being social in a time of isolation; rather than call it ""social distancing,"" she called it ""physical distancing"" because folks who are spending hours on social media are still being social.
Our pull to social media can also be a form of social contagion according to Chris Kearney
, a child psychologist and chair of University of Nevada, Las Vegas's psychology department. Social contagion, also known as behavioral contagion, refers to the inclination people feel to imitate other people's behavior and conform to the group. It's one reason behind the panic to buy toilet paper, and, in this instance, the urge to participate in viral challenges. 
SEE ALSO: How to celebrate your birthday while social distancing
Besides feeling compelled to copy others, there's an element of nostalgia that goes into these behaviors. It's akin to reaching out to exes
. People may find themselves interacting with others online who they haven't spoken to in years say friends from high school which can lead to relating them in those previous contexts. ""The dynamic hasn't necessarily changed you still kind of get caught up in some of the same things,"" said Hertlein. ""There is a dynamic that sort of brings us back to how we used to be."" Say, gossiping with the people you gossiped with years ago. 
It's common that adults feel like they ""revert"" back to an old personality when they're with old friends or their parents, said Viktor Sander, counselor at SocialPro
. ""It's possible that living a more restricted lifestyle that reminds us of our upbringing can affect our personality in a similar way.""
And many people are with their parents in the homes or at least towns they grew up in. When someone is in crisis and not only are many individuals in crisis right now, but nations as a whole they want to be around others who will support and protect them, said Kearney. ""You want to be around people that you trust,"" said Kearney, ""that are going to be able to provide for you and you're going to be able to provide for them sort of a natural instinctual urge for humans."" 
As a result, some adults find themselves in their childhood bedrooms and amid the boredom and anxiety, find themselves sending chain emails for poetry. 
An example of a chain email ""that serves as an uplifting exchange.""
Image: mashable
But changing your environment goes back to gaining a sense of control during a moment when some may feel hopeless. We're going to take back control ""whether we like it or not,"" according to Hertlein but ""we want to make sure that we're taking control in ways that are adaptive and helpful."" Learning a new TikTok dance? That could be helpful. Gossiping to the point of trolling, or scrolling through Twitter for hours to numb yourself? Not so helpful. 
Whether we're stuck in our childhood homes or elsewhere, we all may be reverting to our teenage years a little bit.  The challenges and emails are not inherently bad, but we have to look at the motivations behind them and behind our abundant social media usage, said Hertlein. 
SEE ALSO: Kids are losing their childhood to the coronavirus pandemic. This is what it feels like for them.
The behaviors may all look the same, but it's the reasoning behind it that matters. Using it as a form of escapism is problematic, according to Hertlein, because you are not dealing with your emotions. ""If you're tending to use technology because you're bored and want some social connection, that's a different story,"" she said. 
What's more, is that this will not last forever neither the pandemic nor our behavior related to it. ""When the quarantine ends,"" said Sander, ""it's likely that our personality goes back to normal, given that we take up our old habits."" 
For now, we have viral challenges and TikTok. Don't forget to tag your friends."

In the UK, we are currently under lockdown, and we're only allowed to leave the house for food, health reasons, or work or to do one form of daily exercise. 
In order to fulfil this last criteria, one street in the north west of England is doing something called ""socially distant dancing"" from their driveways and doorsteps. 
Elsa Williams, who lives on the dance-loving street in question, posted a video of the neighbours dancing to Tom Jones' ""It's Not Unusual."" Great music choice.
Everyone in the video appears to be keeping ample distance from each other, and staying on the boundaries of their own drives or properties. In the UK, the government is advising everyone to stay 2 metres (6ft) away from other people at all times, unless you live with them.

Williams explained that the woman in the middle of the road is a local fitness instructor named Janet Woodcock, who leads the sessions.
She added that ""distance dancing"" only lasts 10 minutes a day so as to cause minimal noise disturbance. ""Mostly our road is kids and elderly residents who are self isolating so they look forward to it."" 
It was only meant to be a one time thing, but it lifted people round here up a bit and they wanted more. Its also worth noting that our road hardly spoke to each other before all this!
 Elsa Williams (@elsalwilliams) March 31, 2020
Seemingly, the dancing was only supposed to be a one-off, but everyone on the street was so uplifted by it, it's become a daily event. 
""It's also worth noting that our road hardly spoke to each other before all this!"" she added.

My anxiety levels had already reached an all-time high due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19). I lay awake until the early hours of the morning, my heart pounding in my chest. I had more panic attacks than I'd ever had in my life. Rumours of an imminent lockdown were swirling and the thought of spending weeks and months alone scared the shit out of me. My parents were worried and urged me to leave London immediately. Eventually I took the difficult decision to temporarily move home. Days later, Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the entire UK under lockdown.

I feel lucky and grateful to be in a position to up sticks and move back to Warwickshire. Moving into your childhood home with your parents after years of living independently is an adjustment, to say the least. In London, I live by myself and am used to having huge swaths of uninterrupted quiet time something that has always felt like a luxury. In this haven of alone-time I binge-watch Vanderpump Rules, Queer Eye, and period dramas. Here, my dad loves to watch Midsomer Murders and Agatha Christie adaptations and our nightly TV line-up is a hilariously fraught negotiation reminiscent of my adolescence. Caveat: my dad has graciously allowed me to watch Tiger King and Peep Show, and my mother show has introduced me to a lovely new show called Repair Shop. 
Now, instead of pacing the floors of my flat, I can blast the Spice Girls and dance around the kitchen with my mum. My daily government-mandated walk feels quite literally like a trip down memory lane as I walk down brambly paths I once cycled down when I was a kid. As I write this, I'm sitting in the kitchen of my parents' home. I just ate the same breakfast I used to eat before school. I slept in my childhood bedroom. I feel I've regressed back to my teenage self, but I'm trying to see this period as a chance to spend quality time with my family. 
Many young people have moved home during the pandemic be it due to mental health challenges, risks to their physical health. Several people I spoke to moved out of flats and houses they were sharing with frontline NHS workers assigned to respiratory wards. While university students have been sent home for the remainder of the academic year, other people are experiencing financial issues due to job losses because of the economic fallout from the virus. Some told me they'd moved home to help their parents pay the mortgage because they'd lost their jobs due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. 
So, how are people coping with the significant adjustment and lifestyle change that comes with moving 'back home'? I spoke to people who've moved in with their parents during this time to find out how they've adapted. 
Share pop culture recommendations with your family 
Now that most of us are staying home in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, our lives have changed dramatically and so have the conversations we have with one another. For people living with anxiety, talking about coronavirus non-stop is not helpful. So, it's important to find positive, engaging things you can chat about as a group.
Gemma Ratton moved home to Sunderland to be with her family because of financial worries. 
""Im 22, so pretty skint on my first PR job in London, so it just saved me stresses and worries,"" she said. Ratton was finding London really stressful when the outbreak there began to escalate. ""Just before I left London on the Sunday I tried to do a big shop at Lidl, as I do once a week and this guy started shouting and ramming his trolly into my back because I didnt get out his way,"" she said. 
This is Ratton's first time living with her parents since she was 18, and she feels like they're actually getting on much better now than they did when she was younger. Her top tip is: ""Share any recommendations you have with your family to encourage everyone to get everyone talking about things they love to watch and distract everyone from coronavirus."" Ratton says she's tried things she wouldnt usually do as a result of family suggestions.
""I've got my Dad listening to Desert Island Discs and he's just watched Fleabag after me recommending it,"" she said. ""The hardest part is being at home and not being able to see friends, but apps like Zoom are making it bearable.""
Ratton also recommended mixing up your days. ""Ive been trying to do different routes for my daily walk. Or listen to different podcasts whilst Im walking."" 
Find yourself a designated workspace 
Ellie Pilcher was living alone in London but decided to come home after multiple requests from her parents, who eventually demanded she come home. ""I did it for my mum and dads mental health really,"" she said. ""My mum has chronic asthma and my biggest worry was giving it to her, hence why I stayed in London, but after isolating for a week I felt I was safe enough to go home,"" she said. ""My mum kept saying 'Im so glad youre home' every time she saw me for the next three days!""
""None of us (parents, me and older brother) have gotten ill, and were all in good spirits,"" she added. These good spirits, she believes, can be attributed to the fact they each have a designated room they can work in. Her dad works in his home office, her brother's in the spare room, Pilcher works in the dining room, and her mum has the run of the rest of the house as she doesn't work. ""I feel like Im back at school, doing revision half the time,"" she confessed. They all socialise as a family in the evening but have as much chill time as they like. 
Set boundaries 
Even though you're ""home home"", it might not feel like your home. You're not sleeping in your usual bed, you've only got some of your clothes with you (three outfits in my case!), and you've a lot less alone time than you're used to. 
Pilcher told me she brought a blanket with her from her house and unpacked all her clothes so she wouldn't feel like she was living out of a suitcase. ""Wear headphones when youre working, even if just to block out excess noise. Make sure you shut your door and have as much me time as you can. Even if your loved ones complain about it, me time is important,"" she added. 
Even when you're working from home alone, it's easy to get distracted by household chores that need doing particularly when the mess is bothering you while you work. If your mum or dad asks you to do a chore when you've an afternoon of deadlines or calls, it can become a source of stress or even conflict. Pilcher recommended being clear with your family about the hours you're working and ""what you cannot do during that time (no quick hoovering sessions or folding the laundry) so that you keep to your structured working day without disruptions.""
Do your bit around the house
Even though you're away from your usual home, it goes without saying that this is not a holiday. While none of us should be putting any pressure on ourselves to be highly productive right now (we're living through a pandemic, after all), it's important to do your bit around the house. 
Simple acts like emptying the dishwasher, cooking dinner, making your bed, and keeping your room relatively tidy will relieve others from carrying the majority of the household burden. 
As someone who's spending a lot of time cooking and baking with my mum, I'm seeing it as quality time with her that I don't usually get much of regularly.
Slow down and take it day by day 
Many of us are struggling with our mental health right now as we witness people around the world and indeed, people we know and love coming to terms with losing loved ones. As we adapt to a new way of life with little idea of what the future holds, it's important to be compassionate towards ourselves and the people around us. 
""This is what we all have to do for now, so how can I find ways to deal with it?""
Clare Dyckhoff has asthma and made the decision to temporarily move home for health reasons. ""Being in London isn't great for my health asthma-wise anyway so I wanted to come back to my folks' which has a lot more green space and where the quality of life is generally healthier,"" she said.
She rents a flat in London with two others, who also left. ""We all felt if we were going to be stuck inside for a good few months we'd rather be somewhere with more space and comfort than our loveable but small flat with limited space,"" she added.
""Main attraction of moving home was being with my family (of which none are in the 'at risk' band), having pets to walk frequently, and lots more space to just be more comfortable during this time,"" she explained. ""I'm very fortunate to have this option as so many don't it just felt like the best (and so far is) choice.""
As for making the adjustment, Dyckhoff has told herself, ""This is what we all have to do for now, so how can I find ways to deal with it?"" She is trying to take one day at a time. ""I suffer with bouts of anxiety in general and I've found being forced to slow down and deal with things one day at a time, even on an hourly basis, has been my best starting point,"" she said. 
""That and communicate to those you live with.

Passover is the eight-day Jewish festival that celebrates themes of springtime and freedom, centered on retelling the biblical story of the Jews' liberation from slavery in Egypt. The holiday is an extremely social one: It involves gathering with friends and family over a religious meal called a Seder that's filled with prayer, story, symbolic ritual, and of course good food.
But like so many would-be gatherings this spring, Passover will be different this year. Social distancing orders put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, make getting together for Passover with people outside of your own home an unadvisable health hazard. 
In the Passover spirit of making the most of the time and resources you have under difficult circumstances the holiday's main edible symbol, a cracker-like bread called matzah, stands for exactly this some Jews are turning to another object of necessity to celebrate the holiday this year: video conference calling. 
""Many Jews in North America, Israel, and around the globe are engaging in Zoom and other platforms for Passover seders,"" Rabbi Rachel Sabath Beit-Halachmi, the content director at Jewish communal ethics organization Our Common Destiny
, said. ""Passover has developed over the centuries, and its rituals, texts, and core ideas are evolving and developing now in this crisis in very powerful ways.""
A strict interpretation of Jewish law prohibits the use of electronics during some holidays, including Passover. However, not all Jews follow those customs. The leadership of the Conservative branch of Judaism has said, regarding streamed seders, that leniency should be allowed during challenging times. (Conservatives, despite the name, espouse a more flexible interpretation of certain Jewish laws compared to groups like the Orthodox and Chabad, although they are stricter than liberal movements like Reform.) More religious Jews are connecting over video chat before the holiday actually begins, too. 
""I've seen many people planning pre-Seder connects,"" Rabbi Mordechai Lightstone, the social media editor for Chabad.org, which offers educational information about Judaism, said. ""So using that time to get dressed for the holiday, practice the four questions, share family memories and stories. After the call is done, everyone can light the holiday candles and get set for the evening itself."" 
If you're comfortable using technology during a Seder, there are a few things you can do to not only make the seder run smoothly, but have it be uniquely meaningful, and memorable. Mashable consulted with multiple Jewish leaders and guides about how to pull it off. 
""Our rituals and celebrations cant be stopped by unfortunate circumstances,"" Rabbi Rachel Grant-Meyer, the Rabbi-in-Residence at HIAS, a refugee-aid nonprofit, and author of the HIAS Haggadah
, said. ""We will always find a way to come together and to keep our traditions alive, even if not in exactly the way to which we are accustomed.""
Here's a guide on how to host or participate in a Seder over Zoom.
1. Leadership planning
From cooking to singing, hosting and attending an in-person seder takes a lot of preparation. A virtual one is no exception. If you are planning to ""host"" a seder, it's a good idea to have a pre-planning phone call with other attendee stakeholders to work out some key details. Those are:
<ul><li>Which video chatting platform to use? For the purposes of this article, we're going to assume Zoom because it is affordable, allows for a grid view of many participants, and is free and easy to use for attendees. However, here are some other options, specifically with better privacy track records.
</li><li>Who is going to be the Seder leader? This is the person who will guide the order and discussion of the night.
</li><li>Who is going to be in charge of the technical details? David Ackerman, a senior vice president at the JCC Association of North America, recommends that attendees ""assign someone other than the leader of the seder to be in charge of Zoom."" That way one person can be in charge of tech and troubleshooting (and will need to have a Zoom subscription, if they anticipate it going longer than 40 minutes), while the leader can focus on the actual content.
</li><li>What Haggadah will you use, and how will you distribute it? There are multiple online Haggadot, that you can either send out to attendees ahead of time, or display as a screen share over Zoom. Whichever way you go, just make sure everyone has access to a copy.
</li><li>How will you represent the contents of a seder plate? In order to go through the full symbols of the seder, all the objects should be represented. But not every person has to have all of them IRL. Who will be in charge of ""bringing"" what?
</li><li>How will you manage communication? Will everyone be on mute, or will you allow people to interject in some way (you could make use of the Zoom ""hand raise"" function)?
</li><li>What is the scope of the Seder? Your Zoom seder might be abbreviated or different from the whole enchilada, cover-to-cover seder you might typically do or it might not. ""It is important to define the purpose of your seder, and then use that as a guide to figure out what you'll actually do,"" Rabbi Charlie Schwartz, director of content development at The Center for Jewish and Israel Education at Hillel International, said. ""Your purpose could be anything from connecting with family to reading from the entire Haggadah to hearing certain songs sung."" With other seder leaders, establish your goals, and then make your roadmap from there.
</li></ul>2. Planning for everyone
Once you have made these key decisions, it's time to communicate them to all of your guests. Send out an email ahead of time with the following details:
<ul><li>Details: Include the date, time, and how to log on. To ensure privacy, set a password and distribute it ahead of time.
</li><li>Etiquette: Set expectations and a process for how to participate, whether that's using Zoom's hand raising function, that people are going to be muted and then unmuted when called upon, or if your'e opting for some good old free-for-all chaos (this one is not exactly recommended).
</li><li>Agenda: Give people an overview of the purpose of the seder, and what it will encompass.
</li><li>The Haggadah: Make sure people know how to follow along.
</li><li>Assign roles: If you can assign different guests to lead different parts of the seder, that can help everyone feel connected. ""Give each person, if at all possible, a line or two to read to allow for maximal participation, or mute all and encourage people to do their own blessings wherever they are,"" suggests Rabbi Rachel Sabath Beit-Halachmi.
</li><li>Set a dress code: This can be a fun way to add a sense of occasion. ""Make it as special as you can, no sweats or pajamas,"" Rabbi Irving A. Elson, the director of the JWB (Jewish Welfare Board) Jewish Chaplains Council, said. ""Zoom or not, it IS a holy time.""
</li><li>Send a shopping list: Let people know what they should have on hand so they can participate in the rituals you have decided to do.
</li><li>Distribute any other resources: Will you be setting a custom background? Discussing any specific articles?
</li></ul>3. Do a technical dry run
The person in charge of Zoom should try to connect with each attendee ahead of time to make sure they're familiar with the platform. If everyone can try logging on at the same time to avoid technical difficulties on the night of, that's ideal. But some people may need one-on-one help, too.
4. Address the elephant (laptop) in the room.
During a Passover, every object on the table has symbolic, ritualistic, or tradition-imbued meaning. The Jewish leaders consulted for this piece were not all in agreement about how much emphasis should be placed on the tech. But in the dialogical spirit of Passover, addressing the reality of the technology could be a powerful way to begin discussion of the Passover story.
""The question that kicks off the entire seder is ""why is this night different from all others?"" David Ackerman said. ""Most people will have a ready answer to that question. The more interesting question is, 'How does the inability to gather in person for this year's seder provide us with new insights into the essence of the Passover story?'""
It could also serve as a poignant lens through which to see the night's themes and various rituals.
""The whole idea of matzah is that we make something out of nothing if our dough doesnt have time to rise, we strap it to our back and eat it unleavened,"" Rabbi Rachel Grant-Meyer said. ""Similarly, I see the presence of a computer screen as making abundance out of what could have seemed like nothing.""
5. Keep Order
Try your darndest to stick to the mute vs. unmute etiquette you set out in the planning emails. Reiterate the expectations and make sure people are clear on how the night is going to run. Since video chatting is a bit complicated with a night of discussion and music, here's what Rabbi Schwartz recommends for keeping everything running smoothly during the singing portions of the night  Seder does mean ""order,"" after all! 
Singing together is one of the highlights of the seder, but most video conferencing platforms have a good amount of lag time between when a person speaks and when it's heard by the other participants making singing together a challenge. Try having everyone but the song leader sing along on mute, this will give the joy of singing as a group, but without the frustration of everyone being one second off. 
Then again, there are also Zoom choirs flourishing in our time of social distancing, so singing together virtually can be done. If raising your voices together trumps well-ordered harmony, have at it.
Here are some tips from Rabbi Rachel Sabath Beit-Halachmi on keeping people engaged, but also making the seder orderly...enough.
Have a leader for each section, if not for the whole. Assign roles for participants, and unmute only those speaking, and unmute all only for cacophony and to hear the sounds of all at certain points and at the beginning and end. 
6. Document
If the circumstances of this year's seder seem extraordinary, that's because they are. Designate a person to take screengrabs, keep notes, or write memories of the night.
""This is a moment were never going to forget,"" Jason Leivenberg, the director of NuRoots, which focuses on creating community for Jews in their 20s and 30s, at the Jewish Federation of Great Los Angeles, said. ""In light of what the holiday calls on us to do, which is remember, how are we going to document this for generations?""
7. Have patience, and let it be.
Many memorable seders include an element of chaos. And with a big change this year, accepting that the evening might contain bumps in the road, or feel different, will help everyone make the most of their time.
""Theres gotta be a layer, a level, of being patient with each other during the actual dinner,"" Leivenberg said. ""I think the sooner that we can embrace that its just going to be different, the more fun we can have, and the more we can actually also take it seriously.""
8. Turn towards the future
The Passover seder ends with the refrain ""Next year in Jerusalem."" As we all make sacrifices to help flatten the curve and fight coronavirus, at seder this year, many Jewish leaders said we can also include a hope for ""next year in person.""
We can also consider what Jews' ability to gather if remotely during this time, shows us about our past, and our future.
""At its core, the story of Passover is about the journey from slavery to freedom, from difficult circumstances to a better future,"" Rabbi Schwartz said. ""Jews have told this story at every period of our history. During times of abundance and freedom, the seder has helped orient us to the needs of others, while in difficult times the seder has grounded us in the hope that, 'this too shall pass.' This year, the prevalence of virtual seders can not only connect us to those who are isolated but also provide a hopeful reminder that we too are on a journey toward freedom.""
Amen to that, and Happy Passover."

The Late Night host traces the wasted time between Trump's February claim that the coronavirus pandemic would ""disappear by April,"" and well, actual April. 11,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, and millions more are without income as their employers shut down. On top of this, the U.S. government is making it as difficult as possible to access support. For example, telling people to find a fax machine to apply for unemployment.
""This is not some accident of history. There's a reason you can get a package of alcohol wipes from Amazon in 48 hours but to apply from unemployment benefits from the government you have to download MS-DOS,"" Meyers says.
""The reason is that billionaires and corporations have hollowed out our public infrastructure with the help of corporate ghouls in the political establishment, and now companies like Amazon are more powerful than our decrepit federal government.""
Meyers goes on to break down Trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic since the beginning of the year. Weeks of self-serving lies downplaying the true danger, then lies about lying. Refusing to allow uninsured Americans to access healthcare in a pandemic without going bankrupt. Hoarding federal stockpiles of ventilators and masks for absolutely no logical reason, even though they're desperately needed by hard-hit states like New York.
""Oh, that makes sense,"" shrugs Meyers. ""It's like my doorman told me: 'The front door belongs to the building. If you wanna go to work so bad, climb down the fire escape.'""
""One lesson we're learning from all of this,"" he sums up, ""is that it's better not to be governed by sociopaths."""

Lori Yata, who co-owns the winery, told local paper the Herald-Mail that she was a little nervous her good pup might not always be the best delivery boy as he carried bottles for pick up orders.

But video evidenceshows Soda doing amazing at his new gig. And it can't hurt business to have a cute dog bring out orders. 
Before this all happened, we had so many customers who came to see Soda. Theyd grab a glass of wine, sit on the floor with him, some would take him outside. They love Soda Pup, Yata told the Herald-Mail. Being a small business, we are trying to keep ourselves afloat. So we decided to use a little bit of enticement to get people in.
The winery last week posted an update ""from Soda"" that was frankly adorable and explained he wasn't getting overworked.
""Man, am I getting a lot of attention just for doing something I love, helping my mom and being around my friends,"" read the Facebook post. ""I just want to be perfectly clear, I never carry more than two bottles of wine. I never make more than one trip per customer."" 
""Sometimes I dont have wine in my sack at all I just to go out and meet people when they come to buy their wine,"" Soda added. ""When Im tired I lay on my BIG comfy bed and nap.""

That's why the recent spike in sex toy sales as  COVID-19, the diseased caused by the coronavirus, spreads is something to celebrate. In the now-iconic words of the New York Health Department, during the pandemic, ""you are your safest sex partner."" Couples who suddenly find themselves being long-distance while quarantining in separate homes are turning to pricey high-tech, internet-enabled sex toys that claim to keep you connected while apart, according to reports of booming sales from Rolling Stone and Ask Men.
But they're in for an unpleasant surprise.
Now is the worst time to waste your money on internet-connected sex toys. In our exhaustive testing of some of the most popular high-tech toys, we found that most touting features like Bluetooth connectivity, WiFi-enabled remote play, app features, and interactive long-distance toys that sync with your partner were barely functional even before the pandemic. Now, with internet speeds in cities across America and Europe declining, they are likely more unusable than ever.
So horny, well-meaning social-distancers are now spending between $150 to $400 for internet-connected features made moot by the very thing they sought to circumvent (coronavirus). And in this economy, no one has the cash to waste on a useless, non-refundable smart dildo.
Luckily there are far more affordable, albeit analog, ways to bring innovation into your love life, whether you're flying solo or with a long-distance partner. You just might have to get a bit more creative.
Why smart sex toys won't work right now
There's a multitude of ways and reasons behind the failures of the tech in the smart sex toy space. But the biggest culprit is particularly exacerbated by the ripple effect of coronavirus: bad Bluetooth connection. You see, many smart sex toys claim that by connecting to Bluetooth, you can do everything from let your partner control your toy remotely or sync it up to their smart toy so the two respond to each other's movements.
No one has the cash to waste on a useless, non-refundable smart dildo.
That sounds awesome! Or it would be, if it weren't for the fundamental problem that no one's figured out how to make Bluetooth compatible with the human body, since water repels Bluetooth signals and our bodies consist of up to 60 percent water.
That means most internal toys (which many of the most popular high-tech toys are) inevitably and repeatedly lose connection when used as instructed. The more turned on you get (meaning, well, wet), the worse that connection becomes. That's not to mention that closing your legs or wearing any clothing can cause even more interference. So your best bet for a spotty connection during your virtual quarantine sex is to remain bare-ass naked and spread eagle the entire time.
On top of all that, the apps used to supposedly connect the toys to you and/or your partner's phone boasting integrated video chats and control panels are also nightmarishly unusable, full of glitches and bad design.
Again, these are just the standard problems for internet-connected toys on the best day. During the pandemic, governments in the EU, UK, and Australia are going so far as to ask Netflix to slow down streaming speeds and quality in order to keep up with the high internet demands. Your smart vibrator just isn't a necessary strain on those already shaky online infrastructures.
At the same time, not all smart sex toys are created equal. Some address these problems better than others. But many of the top high-tech sex toy companies seeing spikes in their sales during coronavirus are also unfortunately some of the worst offenders. 
You don't need smart toys making virtual sex even more awkward than it is.
Image: bob al-greene / mashable
Every single Bluetooth-connected toy from We-Vibe that we tried from its internal vibe Jive, to external panty vibe Moxie, and even its interactive couples toys Rey and Reina couldn't maintain signals despite several different troubleshooting attempts. That's not to mention the We-Connect app, which has hundreds of irate reviews on the App Store that speak for themselves.
Another oft-mentioned high-tech sex toy brand seeing an uptick right now is Kiiro, which didn't fare much better in our tests. When trying the Fleshlight Launch paired with Ohmibod's Fuse, the two could barely maintain connectivity even when placed right next to each other. For the brief moments they did, we were further disappointed to find that claims of the toys syncing up to mimic a partner's motions were delayed and spotty (if it happened at all). So imagine all the frustrations of a laggy video chat, but on your genitals. Well, it's at least extremely effective at chasing away any hope of an orgasm, I guess.
Oh, and that's only if you don't receive a malfunctioning Fleshlight Launch (like we and many others did) that comes broken straight out of the box. Kiiro does take returns on these, sending a new one free of charge. But think of the poor delivery person you're causing extra work for.
To be fair, certain big names in the space are doing more than others to fix these problems. 
Though it has its own litany of issues, Ohmibod's line of app-enabled toys delivers far better connection due to its reliance on cellphone signals rather than just Bluetooth. The BlueMotion NEX1
 is currently seeing higher sales right now and was one of the most reliable during our tests (though as of publication, it's disappeared from the company store). Out of all the interactive long-distance couples toys, Lovense's Max and Nora was the most functional and reliable, though that could change depending on lower internet speeds.
What to try instead
Before you sink hundreds of dollars into these high-tech bells and whistles, there are way more reliable and cost-effective methods for staying sexually connected during the pandemic.
Doing a virtual mutual masturbation session where you both get off like you normally would (whether with a regular toy or just your hand) is always an option. If you're intimidated by the idea of video chat sex, we recommend audio sexting, whether through a phone call or voice notes. 
If the idea of audio sexting sounds foreign and weird to you, consider our previous advice espousing the benefits of sexy voice notes:
Just think about how much the sound of your partner's pleasure adds to your pleasure during IRL sex. Now also remember that you can say everything you'd send in a sext, but with your actual voice, maybe even while touching yourself, and moaning.
The beauty of audio sexting comes back to the benefit of voice feeling far more intimate than texting, while at the same time a lot less unforgiving than video or picture. Also, audio leaves a lot more left up to the imagination, which is very conducive to long-distance desire. 
To be totally clear, we're also not discouraging people from taking this golden opportunity to explore sex toys, whether it's for self-love or with a partner while social distancing. Just know what's worth spending your hard-earned money on, particularly if you're a beginner. 
We've got a more extensive guide for sex-toy novices here. But the TL;DR is that you really don't need to shell out a lot of money for high-quality toys that get you there. Personally, my go-to recommendation for people with vaginas is anything by Dame, particularly the Kip, Fin, and Pom. For the extra budget-conscious option, you can't go wrong with Maude's Vibe.

Or hell, maybe you do want to splurge on a new, high-tech experience. Lioness, the smart rabbit-style vibrator that tracks biofeedback during your orgasms is worth every penny for that. Since the Lioness only needs to connect to the app on your phone via Bluetooth to transfer data after you've finished cumming, it's more reliable and doesn't get in the way. And it's never been a better time to masturbate your heart out to understand and explore your sexuality more, which Lioness can be a great tool for.

But the world of sex tech is also much bigger than just toys, with other digital services offering new ways to get off at far cheaper price points. We can't recommend apps like Dipsea enough, a platform with audio erotica and how-to guides that's usually $8.99 per month but with free content available now through the end of April. There's also O.school, a popular online platform for sex education that's hot and all about teaching you how to explore more of your pleasure.
It's not only natural but genuinely responsible to seek safe ways to connect with each other right now. Whether it's with a partner or by yourself, deepening your intimacy is one of the most productive things to do during quarantine.
While Bluetooth-enabled smart sex toys might have a tough time being able to maintain connection right now, you don't have to."

Online delivery for groceries, cat food, art supplies, shoes, clothes, and so much more didn't bother us too much before the coronavirus outbreak became a pandemic earlier this month. Now e-retailer Amazon is delaying shipments of ""nonessential"" items a month out to make way for food, medical supplies, and other, well, essentials. 
For smaller businesses, online delivery may be the only way to economically survive. But it comes with a lot of trade-offs, especially for employees and delivery workers. As a customer, making the pizza guy brave the outside world, away from a shelter-in-place order, can feel selfish. But then there's the fact that the pizza guy is getting paid, and might not have work, otherwise. You've seen the memes (see below), but still: The mental calculus to decide if you suck for making someone bring you food or groceries is legitimately challenging.

My favorite small business is Imperfect Foods, a produce and grocery delivery subscription based in San Francisco that sources expired, surplus, and ""ugly"" foods at a discount with the mission to cut back on food waste. It's 100-percent delivery-based (there are no bricks-and-mortar stores), but during this public health crisis, it's been just as impacted as a physical grocery store. 
The company has to make decisions about how or if it should provide the same level of service while protecting its workforce. And then there's keeping customers safe while also getting people what they need. 
In a message to customers last week, Imperfect CEO Philip Behn outlined how his workers face the same coronavirus-based issues as anyone. And while his employees may be deemed essential workers on the frontlines of the pandemic, the infectious respiratory illness doesn't know that. That means things aren't running as smoothly as usual. 
We're thinking about the morals of shopping online.
Image: Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images
In his note to all customers, he explained how the company is handling a lot happening at once: ""A spike in demand combined with labor shortages in our delivery fleet and packing facilities caused a large cancellation of orders.""
He went on to highlight the human side of the company. ""As schools, transportation, and logistics in the communities we serve have been disrupted, many of our staff have had to deal with the same challenges were all facing: arranging for childcare, finding a new way to get to work, or taking the necessary precautions to keep themselves safe and healthy."" 
That doesn't mean the company isn't still trying to provide groceries. But it does mean customers should expect delayed orders and even cancellations. It's a balancing act between customer needs, employee safety and abilities, and fiscal decisions. (Good to note: Imperfect has not fired or laid off any workers and doesn't plan to if things continue as they are now.)
In a phone call this week with Mashable, Behn explained that as long as the company sticks to its priorities he can feel comfortable offering the grocery service during this time. ""Everything starts by keeping our associates safe,"" he said. ""We don't have the comfort of working from our homes.""
""Our second priority is to keep serving our communities,"" he continued. ""We've become a needed service. We have stepped up our already-high food safety procedures, and are supporting the physical, emotional, and economic wellbeing of our employees,"" the CEO continued.
At Imperfect, that means a lot of talking things out among leadership, at all-hands meetings, and within unit teams. ""We always start by asking people how they feel,"" he said, especially now.
""The beautiful part of having a company that serves a social purpose is the sense of responsibility,"" he said on the call. ""That's what keeps me energized...""
Yuni Sameshima, CEO of Chicory, the company behind the Get Ingredients button you may notice at the bottom of over 1,000 of recipe websites, laid out his thoughts on grocery delivery as people across the U.S. grapple with the morals of their consumption decisions. Do you put delivery workers at risk or put them out of a job? Do you physically go shopping and take the risk of catching or even spreading the illness while at a crowded store? There's not a great solution for everyone. 
""From an ethics perspective, right now the best we can do as human citizens is social-distance ourselves,"" he said in a recent phone call. ""I think online grocery [shopping] accomplishes that social-distancing mission.""
SEE ALSO: Coronavirus is making it even harder for people to access food in America. Here's how to help.
So businesses like Imperfect are carrying on until it's truly untenable. Sure they're working with smaller and more constrained staffs, burdensome new safety and sanitation protocols like no longer ringing doorbells and keeping all workers 6 feet part at all times  not to mention an anxious customer base. But they're still offering products and bringing them to people in some capacity. And you don't have to feel bad about using them.
In fact, while weighing your next purchase, knowing that businesses are also thinking about these things can help you decide the right move."

Personnel at the facilitywhere someone recently tested positive for the viruswill ""cease all operations"" until their demands are heard, management assistant and lead strike organizer Chris Smalls told CNBC.
In a statement to the news site, Amazon said it is ""supporting the individual in quarantine"" and asked that anyone in contact with them stay home with pay for two weeks. The facility, known as JFK8, remains open. ""We are following all guidelines from local health officials and are taking extreme measures to ensure the safety of employees at our site,"" a company spokesperson said.
But a declaration from on high isn't enough for those folks on the ground. Smalls hopes to pressure Amazon into closing the 855,000-square-foot facility for cleaning while offering all 4,500 employees paid time off. ""Since the building won't close by itself, we're going to have to force [Amazon's] hand,"" Smalls said. ""We will not return until the building gets sanitized.""
""These accusations are simply unfounded. Our employees are heroes fighting for their communities and helping people get critical items they need in this crisis,"" Amazon told PCMag in an emailed statement. ""Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable. We [are] tripling down on deep cleaning, procuring safety supplies that are available, and changing processes to ensure those in our buildings are keeping safe distances. The truth is the vast majority of employees continue to show up and do the heroic work of delivering for customers every day.""
Amazon recently implemented daily temperature screenings at its Staten Island location, and has been consulting with health authorities and medical experts on how to handle building closures for deep cleaning. At least 13 facilities have reported cases of coronavirus. Smallswho previously disclosed to management poor warehouse conditions and a lack of essential suppliesis currently on a 14-day self-quarantine (with full pay for two weeks) after coming in contact with the supervisor who tested positive.

In a blog post published over the weekend, Amazon laid out some of the changes it's making at Whole Foods stores in order to meet increased demand for deliveries and pick-ups while most of America is stuck at home. 
On the consumer end, the most noteworthy change is that new Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods delivery customers need to sign up for an invitation to get food delivered. 
In other words, if you haven't already been using those services, you're going to be put on a waitlist. Amazon said it's letting new customers in each week, so monitor your email inbox if you've signed up.
The Amazon Fresh home page will display available delivery windows each day for anyone who's able to actually use the service. In normal times, you put together your cart and just choose the time that is most convenient for you. Now, you'll have to choose a delivery time first, and you'll only know when one is available by checking the website that day.

Whole Foods workers will also see some changes. Store hours are being adjusted to allow for increased restocking and some stores are actually going to focus exclusively on online deliveries. One store in Woodland Hills, California, for example, will only serve online customers on a temporary basis.
Amazon also noted the safety protocols it has implemented in the wake of the coronavirus, such as glass shields for cashiers and gloves and masks for retail workers. Whole Foods workers went on strike two weeks ago to demand better protections from their parent company. That followed a similar strike by Amazon warehouse workers, who felt the company was lax in its response to the fact that several of them tested positive for the coronavirus."

Around one in four infected people may have no symptoms, as far as experts currently know (the disease is new, so these numbers aren't yet fully certain). So it leaves many of us with a burning question: Is it possible you were infected, but didn't get sick?
It's a question of paramount importance. A bedrock of immunology (the study of how the body defends against infections) is if a virus infects you and you fight off the infection you develop an immunity to it for some time, even if you had mild symptoms. This means, after you eventually get a blood test to show immunity, you could then safely reenter society without immediately catching and spreading the respiratory disease COVID-19.  
""The golden rule of immunology is if you are infected with a virus, get sick, and recover, you probably won't get reinfected with the same virus,"" said Mark Cameron, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University who previously helped contain the outbreak of another deadly coronavirus, SARS, in 2003.
When exposed to a new virus, the body will soon create molecules in your bloodstream, called antibodies, that block the virus from successfully hijacking the body's cells in the future. (That's why vaccines which encourage your body to make antibodies work, and the U.S. eradicated polio over 30 years ago).
This is happening with the new coronavirus, too, but disease experts must observe the response of recovered coronavirus patients to understand how effective this immunity is, how long it will last, and if some people can be reinfected. The CDC, for example, just started recruiting Americans to see who has been infected and made antibodies. People infected with SARS developed immunity for an average of two to three years.
""It's very likely if you got exposed that you mounted a response and you would have antibodies,"" explained Dr. Vince Silenzio, an M.D. and professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health. ""We are fairly certain people are becoming immune [to the new coronavirus].""
And critically, just because someone had a mild response or showed no symptoms at all there's no clear evidence they build up a weaker immune defense against the coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2.
""The bottom line is it's not necessarily true yet that people with mild infections have less of an immune response,"" said Silenzio.
""Asymptomatic infections are just as likely to grant immunity to the bearer as frank infections [meaning infections that cause disease], despite the challenge in identifying these infections and the risk of spread they entail,"" agreed Cameron. 
Why, though, might a significant number of people have such mild (or no) symptoms to this new coronavirus? There could be genetic or health differences that make it more difficult for the coronaviruses to infect a cell. It's also possible that people with milder infections were only exposed to a tiny amount of the virus (like someone picking up just a few particles off a piece of mail versus an ER doctor getting sprayed with millions of viral particles). ""It's possible that asymptomatic people were exposed to a much lower dose,"" said Brian Baker, a biochemist at the University of Notre Dame.
The reason there are severe, mild, and asymptomatic infections will be intensively researched throughout this year, and beyond. Although researchers have learned a great amount about this microbe, the virus is still new to science. After all, this coronavirus only spilled over to humans from other animal species in the last five months. ""We dont have all the answers yet,"" Silenzio said. ""But on the other hand,"" he added, ""it's amazing we have as many answers as we do.""
As far as peoples' future immunity is concerned, there are still some weighty questions out there. For example, there are recent reports out of South Korea and China of people who supposedly already had coronavirus, but then tested positive for the infection again. This would challenge the idea they developed immunity. ""There is some controversy currently regarding whether people are truly immune to COVID-19 once they have it, because there have been stories to the contrary,"" said Cameron. 
""This virus is teaching us new stories""
There's an explanation, however, for these reinfections. There's evidence the virus may have temporarily eased off in these patients, and later picked up steam again. So it could have been the same infection all along not someone getting sick from a new infection. ""Infection causes different courses of disease in people that's not unusual,"" explained Cameron.
Another looming question is how long immunity to the new coronavirus may last, either after recovering from an infection or getting a vaccine (when one becomes available in 2021 at the earliest). For example, if the coronavirus mutates too much, the body's immunity is lost. ""Some viruses change rapidly and some don't change rapidly,"" said Notre Dame's Baker.
The polio virus, for example, doesn't mutate quickly. So a polio vaccination (which sparks the body to produce new antibodies) generally lasts one's entire life. But other viruses, like influenza, mutate constantly and require those annual flu shots you're so familiar with. 
The good news is the new coronavirus hasn't been mutating quickly so far, explained Baker. This means it's relatively stable. We don't know how long immunity might last, but this virus is unlikely to change so fast it will reinfect people or outpace forthcoming vaccines, said Cameron.
At the end of the day, this coronavirus may unwittingly help humanity tame the pandemic. While it's true that asymptomatic people can spread the virus when they're infected (that's why everyone must social distance right now), if one in four infected people are truly asymptomatic, that means that likely millions of people will ultimately develop immunity whether they know it or not and won't be able to spread the virus around until we get a vaccine. ""That would be a good thing,"" said Baker. 
""We can count on the fact that the vast majority of COVID infections will cause immunity,"" said Cameron, noting that a vaccine will then only add to the number of immune people. Ultimately, this is how we end this grim pandemic, now that we've failed to contain it.
Though immunologists have an ever-strengthening grip on this coronavirus, they're aware the microbe is still revealing itself. Each day scientists around the globe learn more about how it behaves and infects people. So stay tuned for an improved understanding of how immunity will play out with SARS-CoV-2, a virus that's on pace to kill some 68,000 Americans by August (but likely many more if we don't sustain extreme social distancing measures). 
""This virus is teaching us new stories,"" said Cameron. ""The story is not yet written."""

Look, if there's a time to take care of yourself and be as comfortable as you can be, it's in the midst of a devastating pandemic. Having a job and receiving a regular paycheck is an immense privilege right now, especially as unemployment and furloughs skyrocket. But what do you have to prove by putting on street clothes?
I firmly believe that you should wear whatever you want while working from home, and that having the mental fortitude to put on a real shirt makes you just as deserving of your salary than someone who's been wearing the same sweatpants all week. 
Today, I'm wearing an oversized t-shirt from volunteering for my college radio station's pledge drive three years ago, a pair of green bike shorts that I also wore yesterday, and a floral lilac bathrobe. This morning I slathered my hair in a deep conditioning mask and have been wearing it coiled in a towel all day. It's a sharp contrast to the ""black-and-red check Brooks Brothers non-iron, button-down shirt, a pair of black Levis 559 five-pocket jeans, Stance socks and black Adidas Samba AV sneakers"" Tschorn listed in his piece, but I'm comfortable! I'm still getting stuff done! And I'd probably experience the same despair and panic that I feel every day if I was wearing a more ""professional"" outfit instead of my current one.
When the coronavirus spread grew to a serious concern last month and Mashable began working from home, I did try to adhere to more stringent work from home suggestions. I avoided working in my bed. I still wore leggings, but tried to put on a new pair every day. I even put on concealer in the mornings. But the anxiety spiraling continued, even with a sense of routine. 
If you're facing the same overwhelming exhaustion that I am, be nicer to yourself. A viral tweet from a few weeks ago has become my mantra: ""You are not working from home; you are at your home during a crisis trying to work."" 
You'll still be able to do your work, regardless of whether you're wearing a button-down shirt or a ratty collegiate one. 
""You are not working from home; you are at your home during a crisis trying to work.""
I've heard this twice today. I think it's an important distinction worth emphasising.
 Neil Webb (@neilmwebb) March 31, 2020
Tschorn argued that the worst part of messy work from home attire is knowing what your coworkers look like when they're at home. 
""What is seen cannot be unseen, and some day you'll all be back together, clustered around a conference table,"" he said. 
And that is perfectly OK. If anything, this pandemic's new work from home culture is a reminder that the people you work with are human beings with lives, too. Who cares what they're wearing? The entire world is grappling with a devastating virus, and everyone's dealing with it differently.  
There are limits if you're going to hop on a video call, you should at least wear clothing. But at the end of the day, you should be able to wear whatever you want while working from home, whether that's yesterday's bike shorts or (ugh) real pants. Do what you need to cope."

The Kidd is the second Navy ship to have an outbreak of the disease while at sea, the other being the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier that has been docked at Guam for a month. The Roosevelt has more than 900 sailors with confirmed cases of COVID-19, but the entire crew has now been tested.
The Navy has moved swiftly to get the Kidd’s crew ashore. That was a point of contention with the Roosevelt, whose skipper, Capt. Brett Crozier, felt compelled to write to several other commanders pleading for more urgent Navy action to protect his crew of nearly 5,000. Crozier was then relieved of command for what the Navy’s top civilian official at the time, Thomas Modly, called poor judgment. Modly resigned several days later, and the Navy is now seeking higher-level approval to reverse his move and restore Crozier to command.
The Navy said that 63% of the Kidd’s crew of more than 300 had been tested as of Tuesday. One sailor was medically evacuated to the United States on April 22 after experiencing shortness of breath. Fifteen were transferred to another ship with a medical facility for closer observation of symptoms.
Sailors being removed from the Kidd at San Diego will be isolated with twice-daily medical screenings. Crew members who have tested negative will enter quarantine for a period of observation, with military health professionals monitoring them for symptoms. Also, a small contingent of sailors who tested negative will remain on the ship for essential services and deep cleaning. The cleaning is expected to take two weeks.
The destroyer had been off the Pacific coast of Central American doing counter-narcotics operations.
With the Roosevelt and Kidd both in port, the Navy said no deployed ships currently have known coronavirus cases aboard. Thirteen ships that previously had one or more active cases while in port have zero cases now, the Navy said.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)Many things are at stake as the nation battles the Covid-19 crisis; among the central long-term concerns is the fate of our right to vote. Facing so much suffering and death has left many grief-stricken Americans feeling robbed of a voice -- and voting is a crucial way of shouting back, ""I'm here. My loved ones and I matter."" Unfortunately, voter suppression has threatened that right for thousands of historically disfranchised Americans with tactical precision since the US Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a 2013 decision, Shelby County v. Holder, which found unconstitutional sections of the act that required states with long histories of discriminatory voting practices to get Justice Department approval before changing voting laws.
Since that decision, numerous states have changed laws to require voters to show photo IDs, have purged their voter rolls, or have shortened or ended early voting. Court challenges in Texas, North Carolina and other states have shown that these changes make it harder for black, Latino, poor and older communities to vote. As reported by the ACLU in a recent commentary on voter suppression in 2020, 70% of voters purged from the Georgia rolls in 2018 were black. Across the country, counties with larger minority populations have fewer polling places and poll workers per voter, and since 2010, the number of states that have imposed voter ID restrictions has risen to 36, according to the same report.
Fears that voter suppression will become even more rampant during the current pandemic are growing, especially in light of the Wisconsin primary election on April 7. There, the State Supreme Court ruled that in-person voting could take place despite concerns about the global pandemic.
Then, the Supreme Court cemented that ruling, deciding that absentee ballots returned after the election would not be counted, even though election officials failed to mail them out in time. Never mind palpable concerns that this move would have a disparate impact on black, Latino and poorer communities in Wisconsin, where the lack of poll workers and polling places was such that in Milwaukee they had to consolidate 180 polling places to just five. For Milwaukee, which holds Wisconsin's largest African American population, this meant they had fewer polls even though the number of voters there was expected to be high.
The nation can ill-afford a repeat of what happened in Wisconsin. 
These actions by the Supreme Court are unlike anything we've seen since the era when the Voting Rights Act was passed, when many Southern states, including South Carolina and Virginia, continued to enforce discriminatory voting practices such as poll taxes and convoluted methods of voter registration that discriminated against African Americans. During that time, between 1965 and 1969, the Supreme Court stood on the side of voting rights and issued several key decisions upholding the Voting Rights Act in response to this state resistance. The scale of the more recent changes, coupled with concerns that suppression will rise in the age of Covid-19, means combating voter suppression cannot be limited to one or two policy reforms. It has to entail a full-fledged, comprehensive plan to stamp out suppression at every turn.
Some states have made small positive changes. For example, 16 states and DC have approved automatic voter registration, but only 12 of those states will have it in place in time for the November elections. As for same-day registration, 24 states will have this in place for November.
However, a patchwork quilt of state efforts is not the answer. Nor is last-minute decision making, as we saw in Wisconsin. But just as the governors have led efforts to stem the tide of Covid-19, they can also stem the tide of voter suppression.
Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia has provided a road map. On April 12, building off the foundation laid by the state legislature, he initiated a full-on attack against voter suppression. Virginia's new measures include establishing Election Day as a holiday, removing a requirement for a photo ID, and expanding early voting to 45 days before an election. 
These are well researched, common sense, evidence-based solutions that non-partisan voting rights advocates have pushed for years. Northam articulated what voting rights advocates have zealously argued and international human rights law enshrines, that ""voting is a fundamental right,"" and that voting laws should ""strengthen our democracy by making it easier to cast a ballot, not harder.""
I spent more than a decade as a voting rights advocate working with Congress to ensure that the rights of all voters are protected, and with legal and community partners around the country to help ensure access to free and fair elections. It's clear to me that this is a moment when strong coordinated action to protect voting rights is urgently needed. The history of constitutional law related to voting rights in this country has almost exclusively focused on expanding the franchise and not limiting it. But actions by partisan governors and legislators since 2016 have sought to turn back the clock.
These legislators, governors, and national leaders at top levels have chosen politics over the right to vote. The Covid-19 pandemic, sadly, presents another opportunity for those same leaders to try to suppress voting by people whose voices, historically, have been muffled and lives lost in the fight to participate in our democracy.
So, as the country wrestles with the pandemic and the life and death decisions we are depending on our leaders to make, protecting the right to vote is more important now than ever. This was evident in the outcome in Wisconsin, despite the efforts to curtail voting. Ensuring people's right to vote is at the heart of protecting our democracy. The playbook has been written. Now governors and lawmakers need to show courage and conviction, prioritize the interests of the citizens they were elected to serve, and follow it."

Diffie, who topped the charts in the 1990s with honky-tonk singles including “Home” and “Pickup Man,” died in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 29 after he tested positive for the virus. He was 61.
In the days following his death, Facebook and Twitter users posing as internet sleuths falsely claimed media reports hid that he had lung cancer. He did not. The untrue claims appear to have stemmed from an obituary posted online for Diffie’s father, Joe Diffie Sr., who passed away in November 2018 from cancer.
The inaccurate claim about Diffie is one of many from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube users seeking to sow doubt about the impact of coronavirus. Many of them claim that health officials, government leaders and media outlets have overblown the danger of the virus, millions being infected with it worldwide.
Diffie’s widow, Tara Terpening Diffie, pleaded on Instagram for people to stop sharing the misinformation about her husband. In a statement, she said she hoped to set the record straight about her husband’s death so that their family can focus on grieving for Diffie and celebrating the Grand Ole Opry member’s legacy.
“There have been some untrue statements about my late husband that are false and hurtful,” Tara Terpening Diffie said. “Joe did not have lung cancer and was a healthy, loving father, husband and friend. He also kept a very busy touring schedule and loved his fans who’ve supported him all these years.”
Diffie, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, died just days after announcing he had contracted the coronavirus. He is survived by his wife, and seven children from four marriages.

We're scared. We're trapped inside. We're lonely. We miss human touch. We need sweet, sexual release.
So in an act of true due diligence, the New York City government released a guide to fucking during the pandemic. And it comes bearing some truly iconic lines, while also delivering extremely pertinent safety information. 
Shortly after it caught the attention of Twitter, though, the guidelines were removed from the government's website. We asked city officials to verify the document's legitimacy and the reason behind the removal of its important information. But NYC Department of Health Press Secretary Patrick Gallahue offered only that, ""Our guidance is updated regularly and we are working on having it back up soon."" Mashable will update this article if it is re-uploaded, and if a more straightforward explanation is provided.
Regardless, the document has already been immortalized with screenshots. And we did the public service of summarizing its highlights below.
""
You
 are your safest sex partner,"" the government had insisted, echoing that voice inside your head with longstanding trust issues.
After a little foreplay with facts on the virus, the guide got right to the point, asking what's on all our minds: ""But can you have sex?""
While COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has not been found in semen or vaginal fluids, banging still requires being closer than the recommended social distancing of six feet. It can also spread through one's saliva or mucus. So, you can definitely still catch the virus by having sex (unless you're, like, inhumanly endowed I guess).
""
You
 are your safest sex partner,"" the government had insisted (yes in bold), echoing that voice inside your head with longstanding trust issues. This directive is followed by what, shall we say, comes close to a recommendation from the NYC Health Department to masturbate your goddamn heart out, with a reminder to wash your hands and sex toys after.SEE ALSO: Coronavirus anxiety has exes sliding into the DMs
But the NYC Health Department is an understanding partner. It knows that, while masturbation is the best method of prevention, people are gonna be fuckin' and suckin' anyway. So the next (and only other) safest option is to do so with someone you're living in quarantine with (who, uh, also presumably is not your flesh and blood).
With not a single shred of slut-shaming, the NYC government woefully admitted though that this is not the time to be spreading the love anywhere else unfortunately, even if your livelihood depends on it. But, it suggests, have you tried sexting ;) 
You practicing the safest pandemic sex like a boss.
Image: bob al-greene / mashable
In all seriousness, though, if you do the sexting or the porn on your computer or phone, be sure to also disinfect your devices (here's our guide for phones and computers).
The NYC Health Department seemingly regretted to inform the public that, ""rimming (mouth on anus) might spread COVID-19.""
Finally, we get down to the nitty-gritty dirty talk, when (I shit you not and can't emphasize this enough), the NYC Health Department seemingly regretted to inform the public that, ""rimming (mouth on anus) might spread COVID-19."" It's not anti-rim-jobs under normal circumstances, necessarily, but since the virus has been found in feces, it could theoretically be spread through ass to mouth action.
Then there was the more common sense (though still scintillatingly well-informed) guidelines: Kissing definitely spreads COVID-19, so don't do that with anyone other than quarantine buddies, avoiding that and sex with them if you or they start feeling sick. Most sadly, if either you or your quarantine partner is part of a high-risk group, it's better to avoid sexual contact altogether. 
But may we offer our own potential workaround for high-risk partners? Try mutual masturbation instead (while maintaining a six-foot distance, of course). It's proper social distancing, but sexy.
Condoms are also now particularly important for oral and anal, the health department had stated, since it lessens contact with saliva and feces. And folks, washing your hands and toys post-coitus and masturbation has never been more important. We'll add that this shouldn't be hard to abide by since everyone should already be peeing after intercourse anyway.
In these trying and terrifying times, the public needs its government to rise to the occasion. And in this instance, the NYC Health Department had risen, hard, erecting a throbbingly comprehensive monument to safe sex in the age of COVID-19. Until all of that deflated.
Honestly, it did such a thorough job that I think I'm horny for the NYC Health Department now? Is that...possible? Where's my goddamn vibrator??

One such activity that Poland is encouraging: Minecraft. Poland has set up its very own Minecraft server, in order to encourage community gameplay. The server will also host a competition to see who can build the best replicas of known architecture. Each Minecraft player will be given a virtual plot and building materials. The contest launches Sunday.
The campaign also has a slew of other events planned. There will be game development webinars, dozens of puzzles, Polish history quizzes, and more.
With schools are currently closed until March 25, the government of Poland seems to have really put in the effort to keep young people busy during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, the country currently has
 425 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus."

Oh, and BTS. They appeared via video chat to perform ""Boy With Luv,"" and then they featured once again (albeit briefly, and in photoshop form) in Corden's explanation about the importance of social distancing measures.
In particular, Corden addressed the younger members of his audience, and any of their friends who may be saying things like, ""How is it even worse than catching the flu?"" by using the seven-piece boyband as a visual numbers aid.
""The seasonal flu is serious for lots and lots of people; COVID-19 is roughly 10 times more lethal,"" explains Corden in the clip above. ""When you get the flu, two things happen: One, you get overly invested in The Bold and the Beautiful, even though you've never seen it before [...] The other thing that's going to happen, if you go out with the flu, you're going to infect, on average, 1.3 people. And those 1.3 people will infect 1.3 people. And if that happens 10 times, you will have been responsible for giving the flu to 14 people   and that's two BTSes on a couch, getting invested in The Bold and The Beautiful.""
Corden goes on to emphasise that while the flu is infectious, coronavirus is very infectious.
""If you are carrying COVID-19 [...] it's thought that on average, you are likely to infect three people. Now that might not sound like much of a jump, but if those three people pass it on to three more people, and those three people pass it on to three more people, and so on and so forth, that only has to happen 10 times, and you have been responsible for infecting 59,000 people.""
Sobering numbers."

The fantasy movie hasn't reached the heights of most other Pixar films at the box office, having pulled in $103 million worldwide to date. But there are clear reasons why Onward has underperformed. Many movie theaters are closing shop for now and, of course, people everywhere are being urged to stay home.
Like other studios, Disney's in a bit of a bind with its release strategy. Since Onward is already out in the world but fewer folks are actually able to see it right now, bringing it to Disney+ while people are holed up with their loved ones will give them something new to watch. Those who want to see Onward but haven't been able to will also have another reason to sign up for Disney+ if they haven't already. At the very least, it might lure kids away from endless Frozen 2 repeats."

We've asked Instacart for comment on the decision to continue with the strike.
It's not certain how many workers are participating in the measure, but it might have a tangible impact. Instacart is already struggling to cope with the surge in demand from customers determined to avoid grocery store trips that could increase the risk of virus infections, and losing even some of those workers to a strike could exacerbate the situation.

In addition to other initiatives, the network will work with social media influencers to pass on accurate information and advice to young people in Southeast Asia and Africa. Some of the individuals it plans to work with include Bianca Gonzalez, a health expert from the Philippines with more than seven million Twitter followers, and KlikDokter, an Indonesian health blog with approximately four million Facebook followers.

According to the government, a lot of the misinformation spreading on social media is leading people to inaccurate advice. In one instance, the government says people in West Africa received WhatsApp messages claiming to come from the Canadian Health Ministry that said drinking warm water can prevent infection. ""These pose a serious risk to health and can speed up the spread of the virus, by stopping people taking simple practical, preventative steps like washing their hands,"" the DFID said.
Compared to some of the other ways we've seen organizations use the reach of influencers in the past, this is a smart and proactive way to get information to young people who usually don't turn to traditional media for their news coverage. In some ways, however, governments are fighting a losing battle when even newspapers are spreading false claims."

The retail chains don't have much choice. Even in states that don't have shelter-in-place orders, officials are urging the public to stay at home as much as possible and reduce the spread of the coronavirus. That's having a chilling effect on sales in general, let alone on retail. There's also a question of public perception.

Because there were so many undocumented cases of infection in China at that time, it was these people with undiagnosed COVID-19 coronavirus who spread it the most, leading to the ""rapid spread of the virus throughout Chinam,"" the researchers report. 
Using mathematical models to simulate the spread of the virus, the researchers calculated the contagiousness of people who were reported to have the COVID-19 virus and the estimated number of undocumented cases.
The researchers found that undocumented cases transmitted the new coronavirus about half as often as documented cases. But there were a lot more of undocumented cases. As a result, people who had not been diagnosed were the source of about eight out of every 10 infected cases in China prior to January 23. 
The authors — who included researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London and collaborators from universities in New York, California, Beijing, and Hong Kong — noted that those who don't get diagnosed often have mild or even non-existent symptoms.
Consequently, these patients ""can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur,"" the researchers wrote. They concluded that if the virus among undiagnosed people hadn't spread, the cases could have been reduced by 66% in Wuhan and 79% across all of China.
Who does and does not get tested for the COVID-19 virus continues to be a dilemma in many parts of the world. Many jurisdictions have challenges around offering to test people, getting access to chemicals for tests, and other barriers.  
Many in the US who want to be tested are struggling to get access to a swab. And many of the tests distributed across the country in late January didn't work. The federal government is ramping up testing nationwide, but it's taking time to get people tested.
Canada currently has a national policy that people with no symptoms are not being tested. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been exposed, as his wife Sophie tested positive for the virus, but he has not been tested. He is under a self-imposed 14-day quarantine.
In the UK, however, while celebrity actor Idris Elba had no symptoms, he took a test that revealed he has COVID-19. 
It's this asymptomatic transmission that is why the Trump administration is asking Americans to stay home if they can, avoid groups larger than 10 people, and to stop going to public places like bars and restaurants.
During a press briefing on Monday, Dr. Deborah Leah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, encouraged all Americans — young people in particular — to socially distance themselves in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
""The reason we're taking these strong and bold steps is because we know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms,"" she said, ""and then we know that there's a large group — we don't know the precise percent yet — that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus."""

That seemingly simple question is proving exceedingly hard to answer definitively. In many places around the US, it's difficult to even get tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the virus now spreading across all 50 states, there are far more people in the US who want coronavirus tests than can get them, and those who get tested do wait days for their results.  More than 1.2 million people nationwide have gotten a COVID-19 test, and about 17% of those test results have come back positive, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those who do manage to get tested, the test itself is also painful. 
A test for COVID-19 starts by reaching deep inside a person's nose and throat to extract sputum — the gunk that gets ejected through coughing, sneezing, spitting, and even singing. That throat gunk, in turn, can be tested for the presence of some of the coronavirus' tell-tale genes. 
But, if a person's infection isn't living in the spot where they are swabbed, their infection isn't caught at the right moment, or their sample isn't collected properly, their test could still come back negative.
Here's how the most common kind of coronavirus test, real-time RT-PCR*, actually works, from start to finish:
""Who you test, and when they test, and when you test them, and the specimen that you use to collect all really impact the performance of the test,"" Dr. Jana Broadhurst, director of the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit Clinical Laboratory, recently told reporters on a SciLine conference call.  
Broadhurst estimates that roughly 30% of coronavirus tests may come back negative, even when a person actually has the virus in their body. 
Health care worker tests people at a drive-thru testing station run by the state health department, for people who suspect they have novel coronavirus, in Denver, Colorado, March 11, 2020.
Jim Urquhart/Reuters
That's why if you have COVID-19 symptoms, it's best to stay home for 14 days and self-quarantine, no matter what your test results may show.
Real-time RT-PCR tests can't tell you if you've had COVID-19 in the past; the test is only designed detect an ongoing infection. Scientists are racing to create new kinds of blood tests, which will help determine who's had COVID-19 and who might be immune to it, even if they never had coronavirus symptoms before.
(*Note: RT-PCR stands for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Reverse transcription turns viral RNA into DNA that polymerase enzymes can then properly amplify. The process is also called real-time RT-PCR, because the PCR reaction is measuring the amplification of coronavirus genes in real time.)

Rebecca took the job in Manhattan as a source of income while she focused on her music and other creative pursuits. But the coronavirus pandemic has changed what felt like a secondary gig to something more crucial. 
""There's a certain amount of pride that comes with the job but definitely anxiety would be the overwhelming feeling for me right now,"" Rebecca told Business Insider. 
Store policies where Rebecca works have changed to allow employees to wear masks, but they aren't being provided. Rebecca has had to rely on her Mom to ship a mask to her from another state. The store has, however, provided gloves to workers and requires employees to take breaks to thoroughly wash their hands every 30 minutes.

""Customers mostly forget and get too close to ask for assistance. I have had a total of one customer reference the six-foot rule and respect it.""    
Like Rebecca, she has access to gloves, disinfectant sprays, and wipes, but no masks. She says employees are encouraged to take their temperatures at home before coming into work.      
Both Rebecca and Gabrielle have access to two weeks paid leave in addition to their regular PTO, if they test positive for COVID-19. But like many Americans, they can't access a test. 
""We've had two cases at my store alone and I've worked alongside both of them in the last two weeks,"" says Rebecca. ""But because I can't just get a test to make sure, I just keep working and waiting until symptoms show.""
Essential jobs, hard decisions

""I'm scared to go to work and worried about getting sick over a job that pays less than $12 per hour. But I also feel like I can't just stay home because the elderly need supplies and a kind word. It's really a hard decision."" 
Josh, a 22-year-old UberEats cyclist in Manhattan, said he will continue to make deliveries because it's ""an important service"" and ""somebody has to do it."" It's also the ""only job hiring right now.""        
Josh is using gloves and practicing contactless delivery by leaving food outside apartment doors or with a doorman. One upside, he said, was that his job has actually gotten easier during the COVID-19 pandemic ""because there's no cars on the road.""

Because this flight is launching during a pandemic, tighter restrictions and protocols are in place to prevent the novel coronavirus from making its way to space. The three people headed to orbit tomorrow include NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Ivanishin and Vagner are last-minute replacements to the flight after one of the original cosmonauts assigned to the mission suffered an eye injury. For Cassidy and Ivanishin, this will be their third trip to orbit, while it will be the first for Vagner. The crew will stay on the ISS for a total of six months. Final preparations for a trip to the space station from Russia usually begin in Star City — a small town just outside of Moscow. After a brief stay, the crew then heads to Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where their rocket launches, and enters a two-week quarantine period. Even before the pandemic, NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, required crews to enter a two-week quarantine ahead of their launch date, to ensure the travelers don’t inadvertently carry a nasty bug to space. “We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.” However, quarantine procedures accelerated slightly while the crews were still in Star City. Around the time of Cassidy’s arrival at the beginning of March, stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures were enacted all over the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Had I been in normal quarantine, I probably could have gone out to some restaurants and left the immediate parameters of the Star City area and just been smart about where we went,” Cassidy said during a round of press interviews on March 19th. “But not this time. We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.” Pavel Vlasov, head of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, confirmed that the crews started quarantining earlier than usual. “They do not go on any trips even the traditional like visiting the Kremlin wall and [Sergei] Korolev’s house before setting off to Baikonur,” Vlasov said in a statement on the Roscosmos website. View this post on Instagram Our crew is now less than 48 hours from lift off, soon coming to the end of our quarantine period. I’ve truly enjoyed reading about and watching all of the humorous things people are creating to help lighten the mood during this stressful time. One example is this video written and filmed by a good friend and the Magnuson family. It’s silly, but the message is spot on…the responsibility to shelter in place lies with every one of us. We all must do our part! ⁣ ⁣ #Nasa #Astronaut #Spaceflight #Rocket #shelterinplace #dotheshelter #quarantine @lucianohuck @cdcgov @propertybrothers A post shared by Chris Cassidy (@astro_seal) on Apr 7, 2020 at 12:12pm PDT Cassidy has since traveled to Baikonur Cosmodrome and gone through the regular quarantine procedures. NASA maintains that its employees have been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for controlling infections ahead of quarantine, “such as cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with crew members,” according to a NASA spokesperson. Meanwhile, Cassidy and his crewmates have stayed relatively isolated in their hotel, prepping for the mission, exercising, and even playing ping-pong. “Ironically, the timing of our entering the strict quarantine protocol somewhat magically lined up with the world caving in, in terms of quarantine protocol,” Cassidy said. But come launch day, the sights and sounds leading up to the mission will be much quieter than usual. Roscosmos has banned all media from covering the launch in person, and there will be fewer people on site to cheer the astronauts as they head to the rocket. “Normally as you come walking out of the hotel... there’s music playing and there’s crowds of people lining the walkway as we proceed from the hotel to the buses, and it’s very, very motivating. It’s super exciting,” Cassidy said. But those celebrations will be absent this time around. “It’ll be completely quiet. There won’t be anybody there. We’ll just kind of walk out. Maybe we’ll still play the music and fire the three of us up ourselves. But who knows?” “I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem.” None of Cassidy’s family or friends can be at the launch due to travel restrictions. His wife was able to be with him while in Star City, and she had planned to attend the launch. But after Russia restricted foreign travel on March 16th, her itinerary changed. Ultimately, she went home when he headed to Baikonur Cosmodrome. “We thought we would say goodbye on launch day,” Cassidy said. Despite everything, Cassidy is feeling good ahead of launch. He even shared a rap his friend made on Instagram about how to stay at home to fight COVID-19. He hopes that all of the extra precautions were enough to prevent COVID-19’s spread to space. “I really haven’t been around anybody else, so it’d be really, really strange if I did contract something,” Cassidy said on March 19th. “Anything can happen between now and April 9th, but we’re being really super vigilant so that I can remain healthy to get to the station.” While on board the ISS, the crew will conduct science experiments and maybe even go on some spacewalks down the line. If all goes according to plan, this crew will likely be an audience to this summer’s most anticipated spaceflight event: the arrival of the first crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The vehicle, developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, is slated to take off this May, carrying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the space station. But while there’s plenty to look forward to in space, Cassidy said his mind won’t stray far from what’s happening on the Earth below. “I’ll have a full plate and my mind will be engaged, but I’m still going to be talking, communicating, emailing with my family and loved ones and friends,” Cassidy said. “I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem. It’s certainly my problem, because my family is living it and my friends and my co-workers are living it in real time.” Takeoff for the mission is slated for 4:05AM ET on April 9th. After launch, the crew will make four orbits around Earth and arrive at the International Space Station six hours later. NASA’s coverage of the launch will begin at 3AM ET, and coverage of docking will begin at 9:30AM ET."

About 380 foreigners in North Korea had been placed under medical surveillance, state radio had previously reported. The Korean Central News Agency said Friday that 221 of them were freed from “strict confined medical observation.” It gave no further details.
Some foreign media outlets including Russia’s state-run Tass news agency have reported some foreigners in Pyongyang were to be evacuated soon.
North Korea has said at least 7,000 of its people were in medical surveillance as well. It has said it was strengthening its screening of those who came back from overseas trips or had contacts with foreigners.
COVID-19 has proven challenging to identify, contain and treat in well-off countries, and experts worry an outbreak could be devastating in impoverished North Korea, which has a malnourished population and a chronic shortage of medical supplies.
The country has banned foreign tourists, virtually closed off its borders, delayed the school year and mobilized tens of thousands of government workers every day for disease-prevention efforts. It has closed a liaison office with South Korea indefinitely.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a stronger quarantine campaign and warned of “serious consequences” if the illness spreads to the North. KCNA said North Korea was taking “top-class anti-epidemic measures” in response to recent Politburo decisions.
South Korea has the world’s second-biggest outbreak, with 6,284 cases. Most are in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a cluster was connected to a local church. Escalating outbreaks around the world prompted the World Health Organization chief to call on governments to pull out “all the stops” to slow the epidemic.
“Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.
Italy, the epicenter of Europe’s outbreak, restricted visits to nursing homes and urged the elderly not to go outside unless absolutely necessary. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population after Japan. Research in China has shown COVID-19 to be more severe in the elderly.
Iran also closed schools and universities and introduced checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. President Hassan Rouhani urged state television to offer “happier” programs to entertain those stuck at home.
Palestinian officials closed the storied Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem indefinitely, weeks ahead of the Easter holiday. And virus fears may dull India’s vibrantly colorful spring festival of Holi. Japan on Friday canceled this year’s memorial for victims of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami.
In the United States, where 12 have died from COVID-19, hundreds of people were in self-quarantines due to infections in a New York suburb. A cruise ship off California was ordered to stay put until its passengers and crew could be tested for the virus after four cases were confirmed in previous travelers.
China still has more than 80% of the world’s cases, though its outbreak is steadying. On Friday, it reported 143 new infections and 30 new deaths, almost all in the epicenter city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. China now has 3,042 deaths and 80,552 cases.
More and more patients are being released from the virus-dedicated hospitals hastily built at the peak of its crisis. It has released 53,726 people who were declared cured, while about 6,000 virus patients are still hospitalized in serious condition.

The supplier wasn't able to provide them in the short term, as the company itself was facing a shortage caused by the outbreak. Italy has been hit incredibly hard, resulting in more than 2,500 deaths.
The hospital, located outside Chiari in Lombardy, sent out a distress call through the newspaper Giornale di Brescia, which caught the attention of physicist Massimo Temporelli, founder of FabLab.
FabLab is an Italian company that specializes in innovative manufacturing solutions. However, the restrictions on movement imposed in Italy prevented Temporelli himself — who is based in Milan — from handling the matter.
After searching around, the physicist connected with startup Isinnova, which is based in Brescia — near Chiari, where the hospital is located — and has a 3D printer.
Isinnova's Cristian Fracassi and Alessandro Ramaioli collaborated with Temporelli and began manufacturing valves in the space of 6 hours.
In a Facebook post, Temporelli announced the moment the team managed to design a working valve which has now been used in the respiratory equipment of 10 admitted patients.
Italy's Minister of Technological Innovation Paola Pisano acknowledged the achievement and congratulated those involved.

The study did not break down the disease demographically, for example by age, sex, race or income. The agency also notes that this is essentially a snapshot and cant capture the ultimate outcome for people who have been infected with the virus and havent yet recovered.
The report shows covid-19 is thrusting vulnerable people in the United States into intensive care units and disproportionately taking the lives of people who already face medical challenges.
The CDC analyzed more than 7,000 confirmed covid-19 cases across the country in which health officials had a written record about the presence or absence of any underlying medical condition. The preexisting conditions covered in the records include heart and lung diseases, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, immunocompromised conditions, neurological disorders, neurodevelopmental or intellectual disability, pregnancy, current or former smoker status, and other chronic disease.
The CDC found that, of people requiring admission to an intensive care unit, 78 percent had at least one underlying health condition. Of people hospitalized but not requiring ICU admission, 71 percent had at least one such condition, compared with just 27 percent of people who didnt need to be hospitalized.
Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.
Among all the cases analyzed, 10.9 percent of patients had diabetes mellitus, 9.2 had chronic lung disease and 9 percent had cardiovascular disease numbers that roughly parallel the prevalence of these conditions in the United States. The report did not reach any conclusion about whether the severity of an underlying condition correlated to a more severe covid-19 illness.
Of the 7,160 patients whose chronic illness status was known through health records, 184 died, and 173 of them had an underlying condition, the CDC said. None of the deaths were among people under age 19.
Covid-19 is a respiratory disease. The virus typically infects the upper respiratory tract, but it can also venture deeper into the lungs and in some patients results in pneumonia-like symptoms, requiring hospitalization and sometime intubation on a ventilator. People who smoke or have chronic lung conditions are especially vulnerable.
Diabetes and heart disease are similarly worrisome. Someone already suffering from heart problems whether they had previous heart attack or required a stent installed because of plaque buildup in their vascular system may have a heart that cannot take as much strain as the average person, said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security
When a patient gets infected with something like this coronavirus, the fever causes a spike in the heart rate. Shortness of breath means the patient gets less oxygen. People with limited cardiac capacity can go into arrest.
Diabetes is a metabolic syndrome that involves blood glucose levels and affects how the immune system works, and makes it less effective, Adalja said.
This is why patients with diabetes are at risk for many infections not just coronavirus, Adalja said. They often struggle with infections on their skin and soft tissues, with pneumonia and even more serious conditions.
Those in the high risk group need to be extremely careful.
If they do become infected, the threshold for them seeking medical attention needs to be much lower. They and their clinicians have to keep this in mind, Adalja said. These numbers show us just how crucial that is.
Wilbur Chen, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Maryland, added that while the virus seems to prey on the elderly and sick, it does not mean it does not cause severe illness in younger adults or in children in other words, the risk is not zero among the young. He said, We are now documenting a large number of covid-19 infections across the U.S. and we are now observing more and more of these rare events of severe illness and even deaths among the young."

USA TODAY
Doctors are learning more about COVID-19s newest and oddest skin manifestation, dubbed COVID toes, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adds to the growing list of symptoms associated with the coronavirus.
The American Academy of Dermatology has compiled a registry of skin manifestations associated with COVID-19. About half of the more than 300 total cases on the dermatological registry consist of COVID toes.
The registry is made up of entries by physicians and other health care professionals who fill out a 5-7 minutes survey about patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who develop skin manifestations, as well as patients with existing dermatological conditions who develop COVID-19 and patients on dermatological medications who developed COVID-19. Entries can not be made by patients themselves.
Dr. Esther Freeman, director of Massachusetts General Hospital Global Health Dermatology and member of the AAD task force on COVID-19, said COVID toes are pinkish-reddish pernio-like lesions that can turn purple over time.
She said this shouldn't be confused with a different medical condition that occurs in critically sick patients called purpura fulminans. 
When she first started the registry with the academy, she was expecting to see viral rashes often driven by inflammation. 
What was more surprising to me was this overwhelming representation of these COVID toes, she said.
The secret to fighting COVID-19 could be in recovered patients. Here's how antibodies could lead to a treatment for those fighting coronavirus.
USA TODAY
Where can I get a COVID-19 antibody test? And is it reliable? Here's everything you need to know.
Pernio, also called chilblains, are skin sores or bumps that occur on a patients feet when theyre exposed to cold temperatures. The reason why Freeman calls the new symptom pernio-like is because she believes COVID toe lesions arent a result of cold temperatures.
While experts cant confirm why COVID toes appear, they have some educated guesses. One could be inflammation in the toes' tissue, which is similar to pernio. Another hypothesis is inflammation of the blood vessel wall, medically known as vasculitis. And finally, Freeman said it is possible COVID toes could be caused by small blood clots that form inside the blood vessel.
Doctors at the American Academy of Dermatology have discovered trends studying the registry that werent previously known about COVID toes. Freeman says COVID toes have appeared in very few cases of asymptomatic patients. The majority of COVID toe cases have manifested simultaneously or even after more commonly known COVID-19 symptoms.
Freeman said most patients test positive for the COVID test when they develop COVID toes, which allows experts to assume that the symptom may appear later in the infection.
The timing is complex and difficult to pin down, she said.
What we know about coronavirus keeps changing: Here's all the things you may have missed.
Hydroxychloroquine: States build stockpiles of the malaria drug touted by Trump to treat coronavirus
The majority of COVID toe patients in the registry are younger people in their 20s and 30s, Freeman said, and doctors havent seen a lot cases reported from older people. She also said most patients with COVID toes are healthy and have done well in their clinical course.
I think its important not to induce panic if you were to develop these lesions on your toes, she said. Most of our patients seem to be doing well.
Freeman recommends patients speak to their health care provider if they develop these lesions to assess if they are caused by a different medical condition, or any other reason.
But if there isnt, then they should talk about COVID testing or isolate or consider other ways to reduce the spread, she said.

It feels more like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's horror thriller ""The Birds"" than one of Istanbul's most crowded squares, normally teeming with Turks and tourists alike.
Then again, nothing about the impact Covid-19 is having across the globe is normal or familiar.
Last weekend, the Turkish government implemented a 48-hour curfew for 31 provinces, impacting three quarters of Turkey's population.
And while critics of the government have been calling for these types of severe measures to curb the rise of Covid-19, the initial outcome was disastrous. 
The curfew was announced just two hours before it was to go into effect -- causing a buying panic in some areas as people flocked to grocery stores and bakeries with little regard for social distancing measures.
Social media was flooded with coronavirus dark humor: a husband caught in breach of the curfew fleeing the scene leaving his car and wife behind; a man who tries to dodge the penalty fee by saying he doesn't speak Turkish, but the police figure out that he does.
Following the chaos around the curfew, President Recep Tayip Erdogan addressed the nation, arguing that Turkey is strong enough to protect and provide for its citizens, while urging the population to stay at home, and announcing another weekend curfew.
In confronting coronavirus, Turkey is charting its own path -- as it does in so many other ways.
 During the week, the stay-at-home order only applies to those under the age of 20 or over 65. All other citizens are in theory allowed to go out, although many small businesses are closed, restaurants are open for delivery or pick-up only, public places like parks are off limits, and banks have limited hours.
By contrast, construction sites are in full swing, along with factories and other businesses that are unwilling to take an economic hit.
Some experts say partial restrictions like Turkey's can be successful -- as long as those who are vulnerable continue to be protected and those who do venture out follow the appropriate measures.
""It's an alternative strategy,"" said Dr. Muhammad Munir, a virologist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, explaining that healthy people going out for routine shopping does not necessarily do any harm.
""Eighty percent of the people infected have recovered. So, if it's healthy people who don't have underlying causes, then that is absolutely helpful. The only benefit of a lockdown is that the spread of the disease will be slow, the pressure on the hospitals will be reduced.""
Dr. Jeremy Rossman, a honorary senior lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent says it's tricky given the numbers of cases that Turkey is reporting daily, and that partial lockdowns are only really effective when done early on and a country still has a low level of cases, or if a country has already peaked and is coming out of a full lockdown.
""At [Turkey's] level, most countries are implementing a full lockdown. A partial lockdown can be good, it can balance keeping some of the economy functioning while still trying to contain the outbreak"" He says. ""It depends on how well the population is adhering to the guidance and how well physical distancing and hand hygiene are being implemented in workplaces. But at the rate Turkey is going right now, there is risk this won't be sufficient.""
Turkey is among the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to confirmed coronavirus cases, and its toll is increasing by more than 4,000 cases per day. And the mortality rate has been much lower here than elsewhere -- which has raised eyebrows.
The Turkish Medical Association (TMA) says Turkey's official coronavirus death statistics do not include cases that strongly indicate Covid-19 but test negative.
""Doctors that belong to our association have reported that even those CT scans and/or clinical findings indicate the disease, if PCR test results are not positive, if the patient dies they are not recorded as Covid-19,"" the TMA said in their report. CT scans are imaging tests, while PCR tests are used to detect the RNA of the virus.
Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca argues that Turkey's mortality rate -- just above 2% -- is due to the country's large healthcare capacity and a treatment protocol that is different than other countries.
Koca says that, unlike other countries, Turkey's approach to fighting Covid-19 centers around contact tracing instead of general testing or testing after clinical presentation.
They have also been delaying intubation by using high frequency oxygen for a longer period of time, which he says has yielded better results.
 And Turkey uses the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, a Japanese antiviral, much earlier than other countries in the onset of Covid-19, Koca says. 
But Lancaster University's Dr. Munir is one of many medical experts who opposes the use of the malaria drug.
He said the risk of the side effects outweighs any benefit that using hydroxychloroquine may have.
""Treatments have very little impact,"" he explained. ""When it comes to hydroxychloroquine, the patients might have recovered from Covid-19 anyway, but after a year they might see heart problems coming back, that blindness is appearing. This is why there isn't enough evidence to approve these drugs on a mass scale.""
""We are trying to save lives,"" says Dr. Nuri Aydin, the president of Istanbul University-Cerrrahpasa School of Medicine, one of the hospitals leading Turkey's response. ""What we have seen is that the time that the patients spend in the ICU decreases when they take hydroxychloroquine before they reach the stage where they have to enter the ICU.""
Aydin says there isn't enough data to publish their findings yet and that ""time will show us the real results."" And he adds that they are doing something else differently: Rather than having their patients lying face up, they are keeping many in the prone, ie face down, position. This, he says, has yielded positive results as well. And Turkey has started using plasma from patients that already contracted the disease on those that are still fighting it. 
The government says its ICUs still have plenty of capacity and there is no shortage of hospital beds. And Turkey, which did not report its first case until mid-March, had time to prepare. Indeed, Turkey's hospital system is so good that the country has become a medical tourism destination.
In response to Covid-19, the country quickly developed programs to manufacture and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) not just within Turkey itself, but overseas as well -- sending cargo loads to more than 30 countries, including the UK, Spain, and Italy. 
The gesture of solidarity and goodwill is also perhaps aimed at rebuilding Turkey's frayed ties with its NATO allies.
Ministry of Education vocational schools in Istanbul and elsewhere have been turned into workshops churning out face masks, body suits, and surgical gowns intended for in-country use.
Others produce face shields and gallons and gallons of disinfectants, hand sanitizers, and other essential cleaning products. Masks are obligatory in public places like markets, but are not sold anywhere anymore. 
That was banned because the government is distributing them free at pharmacies, or for those who can't go out, straight to their homes.
Turkey is easing the burden of the epidemic on those under stay at home orders by sending volunteers and police door to door to make sure vulnerable people have the services they need.
Call centers called ""Acik Kapi"" -- Open Door -- area located in every district where those elderly citizens under stay-at-home orders can call in requesting anything from a grocery delivery, pharmacy purchase or their monthly retirement cash.
Eyup is one of Istanbul's populous historic districts, where the phone rings nonstop.
Serdar Karakus, a school headmaster's assistant, and Ugur Uyan, a neighborhood mosque imam, have been authorized to withdraw people's retirement funds and deliver them to citizens who request their service. 
They are both volunteers who say they do this as their duty to their country and their people.
""My parents are elderly. I live in Istanbul. They live in Manatya. They are receiving this service where they are because I am not there to help them,"" Karakus said. ""But someone there is. So to do this for the elderly here, it's like I am doing it for my own parents.""
A few hours later we join a group of policemen who are doing the rounds handing out face masks and Kolonya, a traditional Turkish version of hand sanitizer made up of 80 percent alcohol, usually scented with lemon fragrance.
Sadet Seker, in her 70s, lives alone. Her husband passed away years ago. She speaks to her children regularly on the phone. 
But the last time she hugged them -- the last time she had physical contact with them -- was two or three months ago. She's not sure. We ask if they are in Istanbul.
""Yes, they are in Istanbul,"" she replies and then starts to shake, her eyes filling with tears.
They are so close, and yet they might as well be so far away. How soon she can actually see them will depend on whether or not Turkey's Covid-19 strategy is a successful gamble."

Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he had symptoms of the disease and was self-isolating a day after the prime minister and Britain’s health secretary revealed they tested positive for the virus and were experiencing mild symptoms.
Johnson. 55. is the highest-profile political leader to have contracted the virus. Jack sat beside him in the House of Commons on Wednesday before Parliament shut down until at least April 21 to reduce the risk of infections.
Business Secretrary Alok Sharma said Johnson continues to show only “mild symptoms” of coronavirus.
“He continues to lead the government’s effort in combating Covid-19,” Sharma told reporters, “This morning he held a video conference call and he will continue to lead right from the front on this.
“What this has reminded us is that no one is immune and that is precisely why we ask people to follow the Government advice in terms of staying at home where they are able to do that,” Sharma said.

Johnson has been accused of failing to follow the British government’s distancing measures after he, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 41, and the chief medical officer of England began self-isolating with symptoms Friday.
The medical officer, Dr. Chris Whitty, has been advising the prime minister during the virus pandemic and not said if he was tested.
The editor of the respected British medical journal The Lancet published a scathing editorial Saturday that criticized the government for doing too little, too late to protect public health and leaving the U.K.’s public health system “wholly unprepared for this pandemic.”
Lancet editor Richard Horton wrote that despite numerous warnings, Britain’s strategy for containing the virus failed, “in part, because ministers didn’t follow WHO’s advice to ‘test, test, test’ every suspected case. They didn’t isolate and quarantine. They didn’t contact trace.
“These basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored, for reasons that remain opaque.” Horton said.
Keith Willett, the National Health Service’s strategic incident director for COVID-19, disputed the editorial’s conclusions.
He said the NHS freed up 33,000 beds for virus patients – a third of all hospital capacity -and enabled 18,000 nurses and doctors to return to practice. Three new makeshift hospitals are being built.
“In respect of our NHS responsibilities and response, the facts clearly speak for themselves,” Willett said.
NHS employees have begun getting tested for the virus, a move seen as helping get self-isolating staff members back on the job.
The issue of health workers going into self-isolation has proved to be a big problem for the NHS because workers are sometimes in that position because they have an ill family member, not because they themselves are infected.
Meanwhile, authorities released photos of the inside of the ExCel center, an exhibition space which is being converted into a makeshift hospital. It will have two wards, and ultimately have a capacity of 4,000.
Initially, however, it will house some 500 beds with ventilators and oxygen.
The U.K. had 17,300 confirmed virus cases as of Saturday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. British officials reported that the number of deaths increased by 260 from a day earlier, bringing the country’s total for virus-related deaths to 1,019.
The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

The number of cases in Singapore has more than doubled over the past week amid an explosion of infections among foreign workers staying in crowded dormitories. This group now makes up around 60% of Singapore’s cases.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Saturday that it will take time to break the chain of transmission in the dorms. He wrote on Facebook that the vast majority of cases among migrant workers were mild, as the workers are young. Although cases in the dorms are expected to continue to rise amid ongoing virus testing, Lee said the government is building up its health care and isolation facilities to handle the load.
More than 200,000 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India and other Asian countries live in dormitories in Singapore that house up to 20 people per room with shared facilities. Tens of thousands of workers have been quarantined in their dorms, while some have been moved to safer places to reduce crowding.
Lee said there were early signs that Singapore’s partial lockdown until May 4 is helping to bring the number of new cases down. But he said the government is worried about hidden cases circulating in the population and urged citizens to do their part.

Hassan Rouhani said authorities had to consider the effect of mass quarantine efforts on Iran’s beleaguered economy, which is under heavy U.S. sanctions. It’s a dilemma playing out across the globe, as leaders struggle to strike a balance between restricting human contact and keeping their economies from crashing.
“Health is a principle for us, but the production and security of society is also a principle for us,” Rouhani said at a Cabinet meeting. “We must put these principles together to reach a final decision.”
“This is not the time to gather followers,” he added. “This is not a time for political war.”
Even before the pandemic, Rouhani was under fire for the unraveling of the 2015 nuclear deal he concluded with the United States and other world powers. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement and has imposed crippling sanctions on Iran that prevent it from selling oil on international markets. Iran has rejected U.S. offers of humanitarian aid.
State TV on Sunday reported another 123 deaths, pushing Iran’s overall toll to 2,640 amid 38,309 confirmed cases.
Most people suffer only minor symptoms, such as fever and coughing, and recover within a few weeks. But the virus can cause severe illness and death, especially in elderly patients or those with underlying health problems. It is highly contagious, and can be spread by those showing no symptoms.
In recent days, Iran has ordered the closure of nonessential businesses and banned travel between cities. But those measures came long after other countries in the region imposed more sweeping lockdowns. Many Iranians are still flouting orders to stay home in what could reflect widespread distrust of authorities.
Iran has urged the international community to lift sanctions and is seeking a $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Elsewhere in the region, Qatar reported its first death from the new coronavirus late Saturday, saying the total number of reported cases there was at least 590.
The tiny, energy-rich nation said it flew 31 Bahrainis stranded in Iran into Doha on a state-run Qatar Airways flight. But since Bahrain is one of four Arab countries that have been boycotting Qatar in a political dispute since 2017, Doha said it could not fly the 31 onward to the island kingdom.
“Bahraini officials have said they will send a flight for them at some undefined point in the future,” the Qatari government said in a statement.
Bahrain said it planned a flight Sunday to pick up the stranded passengers. The kingdom said it had its own repatriation flights scheduled for those still stuck in Iran and warned Qatar that it “should stop interfering with these flights.”
In Egypt, at least 1,200 Sudanese are stranded at the border after Sudan closed all its crossings, according to Egyptian officials at one of the crossings. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.
Sudan, which is still reeling from the uprising that toppled President Omar al-Bashir last year, has five confirmed cases, including one fatality. It’s one of several countries in the region where the health care system has been degraded by years of war and sanctions. Authorities closed the borders to prevent any further spread.
Sudan’s Information Minister Faisal Saleh said Sudanese authorities are looking for lodging in Egypt for the stranded passengers. He said authorities have quarantined at least 160 undocumented migrants who were sent into Sudan from war-torn Libya earlier this month.
Residents in Egypt’s southern city of Luxor say they are providing shelter to the stranded Sudanese.
“We have provided food and medicine to the Sudanese brothers,” said Mahmoud Abdel-Rahim, a local farmer. “People hosted women, children and elders in their homes.”
Egypt, which has reported 576 cases and 36 fatalities, imposed restrictions on cash deposits and withdrawals to prevent crowding at banks as payrolls and pensions are disbursed. Authorities began imposing a nighttime curfew last week.

An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the mustard-yellow and beige Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge.
More than 3,500 Louisiana residents have been diagnosed with the disease caused by a new coronavirus, and more than 150 of them have died, according to state figures released Sunday. Deaths include that of the first federal prison inmate — a man with “serious preexisting conditions” who was being held in Oakdale, Lousiana, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said Saturday.
Assistant ministers and worshippers outside the front doors and in the parking lot at Life Tabernacle told media to leave, saying cameras would not be allowed on the property and worshippers had been told not to talk to reporters. They went inside without further comment.
Across the street, neighbors gathered in a driveway, carefully staying at least 6 feet (about two meters) apart.
Paul Quinn, a resident of Central who lives near the church, says this is a health hazard.
“Other congregations are using the Internet, Skype, and other safe ways to congregate. Why can’t they? What makes them so special?” said Quinn. “I wish state police would come out and do something. This is above our little local police level. The state needs to get involved. If they get out of church and go to the grocery store, it’s a serious health hazard. They don’t know how many people they’re affecting, and they don’t seem to care. That’s a problem.”
The virus has killed seven of more than 160 people diagnosed with the disease in East Baton Rouge Parish, according to state figures.
In New Orleans, police broke up a “funeral repast” of about 100 people Saturday afternoon, issuing a warrant for a 28-year-old man who refused to shut it down and giving the band leader a summons, a news release said. Several complaints about that event were among more than 300 received in the past week about violations of a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson said in a separate statement.
More than 1,300 of the COVID-19 diagnoses and 73 of the deaths have been in New Orleans, and Gov. John Bel Edwards repeated on Sunday’s national news talk shows what he’s been saying for days: the city’s hospitals are likely to run out of ventilators by April 4 and of hospital bed space by April 10.
New Orleans tourist economy has also been hit hard, with hotels, restaurants, bars, convention centers and other businesses closed, and food banks running low.
Food banks got a boost when the U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed that they could use about 4 million pounds of stockpiled federal emergency supplies. New Orleans leaders had been asking for about a week before USDA granted the waivers Friday night, The Times-Picayune / The New Orleans Advocate reported.
“We told them tens of thousands of people have been laid off in the hospitality industry, and they need food now,” City Councilwoman Helena Moreno said. “Then they kind of got it.”

Towns talked about the condition of his mother, Jacqueline Cruz, early Wednesday on his Instagram page and urged his followers to take COVID-19 seriously and practice social distancing.
Towns said both his parents went to the hospital recently and were tested for the disease. While his father was released and told to quarantine at home, his mother’s condition deteriorated to the point where she was put on a ventilator and placed in a coma.
“She just wasn’t getting better,” Towns said. “Her fever wasn’t cutting from 103. It’d maybe go down to 101.9 with the meds then immediately spike back up during the night. She was very uncomfortable. Her lungs were getting worse, cough was getting worse. She was deteriorating in front of our eyes.”
Towns said he’s trying to remain positive attitude as his family deals with the situation.
“My mother, she’s the strongest woman I know and I know she’ll beat this,” Towns said. “We’re going to rejoice when she does.”
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

17,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",JOHN SEEWER / AP,U.S. Hospitals Increasingly Worried About Surge in COVID-19 Cases,"Among the biggest concerns is whether there will be enough beds, equipment and staff to handle several large outbreaks",https://time.com/5803605/united-states-hospitals-coronavirus/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/united-states-coronavirus-hospitals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-03-15T21:52:27Z,"(TOLEDO, Ohio) — Government and hospital leaders are increasingly sounding the alarm about the health care system in the U.S. and its readiness to absorb waves of patients in the worst-case scenario involving the new coronavirus outbreak.
Authorities nationwide already are taking major steps to expand capacity with each passing day, building tents and outfitting unused spaces to house patients. They also are urging people to postpone elective surgeries, dental work and even veterinarian care. New York’s governor called for using military bases or college dorms as makeshift care centers.
Among the biggest concerns is whether there will be enough beds, equipment and staff to handle several large outbreaks simultaneously in multiple cities.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health’s infectious diseases chief, said it’s critical that steps be taken now to prevent the virus from spreading quickly.
“The job is to put a full-court press on not allowing the worst-case scenario to occur,” said Fauci, who appeared Sunday on several network news shows.
While he does not expect massive outbreaks in the U.S. like those in Italy, he said there is the possibility if it reaches that point that an overwhelming influx of patients could lead to a lack of supplies, including ventilators.
“And that’s when you’re going to have to make some very tough decisions,” Fauci said.
In Washington state, which leads the nation in the number of positive COVID-19 cases with more than 600 illnesses and 40 deaths, the increase in people visiting clinics with respiratory symptoms is straining the state’s supply of personal protective gear worn by health care workers.
The federal government has sent the state tens of thousands of respirators, gowns, gloves and other protective gear for health care providers. But those shipments aren’t enough, said Clark Halvorson, Assistant Secretary of Health for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response.
The disease has infected over 162,000 people worldwide, and more than 6,000 people have died so far.
Most people who have tested positive for the virus experience only mild or moderate symptoms. Yet there’s a greater danger and longer recovery period for older adults and people with existing health problems.
The nation’s hospitals collectively have about a million beds, with 100,000 for critical care patients, but often those beds for the sickest patients are mostly filled, Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner, told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
“If we do have multiple epidemics in multiple large U.S. cities, the system will become overwhelmed,” he said.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has suggested mobilizing the Army Corps of Engineers to turn facilities such as military bases or college dorms into temporary medical centers.
“States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough,” Cuomo wrote in an opinion piece published Sunday in The New York Times.
Officials in the Seattle area have been setting up temporary housing — and even bought a motel and leased another — to add space for patients who might be homeless or whose living conditions might not allow for self-isolation, such as students in college dorms. King County also is setting up modular housing and is using the arrivals hall at a county-owned airport as a shelter to reduce overcrowding — and meet social-distancing requirements — in existing homeless shelters.
Hospital executives say they’re always planning for disasters and have been concentrating on coronavirus preparations for the past two months.
“If you go past our emergency department now, you’ll see tents erected in the parking lot that allow us to increase emergency department capacity,” Johnese Spisso, president of UCLA Health, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
The system’s network of clinics throughout Los Angeles and Southern California have additional capacity and doctor’s are encouraging telemedicine, he said.
Dr. Peter Slavin, the president of Massachusetts General Hospital, said the next two weeks will be critical as the medical community expects a dramatic increase in the number of cases.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recommended on Saturday that elective surgeries be postponed, including dental and veterinary procedures, so that health care workers won’t be stretched thin and surgical masks can be saved for health care workers dealing with the virus.
ProMedica, which operates 13 hospitals in Ohio and Michigan, is ready to call in help from staffing agencies if needed and is looking at ways to provide child care for employees whose children are off school, said Deana Sievert, chief nursing . Doctors also have voluntarily canceled their vacations.
The community “can flatten off the curve of this,” by avoiding large events, staying at home, washing their hands and practicing social distancing to help U.S. hospitals avoid an onslaught of cases, said Dr. Penny Wheeler, CEO of Minneapolis-based Allina Health, which has 12 hospitals and more than 90 clinics in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Allina also has been canceling conferences, meetings and anything else that does not directly impact patient care.

He’d stop at a hotel after work just to take a shower. He’d wash his clothes in Lysol disinfectant. They did a tremendous amount of handwashing.
But at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, Gulick and his colleagues worried that caring for infected patients without first being able to don an N95 respirator mask was risky. The N95 mask filters out 95% of all airborne particles, including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks. But administrators at his hospital said they weren’t necessary and didn’t provide them, he said.
His wife, also a nurse, not only wore an N95 mask, but covered it with a second air-purifying respirator while she cared for COVID-19 patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center across town in Los Angeles.
Then, last week, a nurse on Gulick’s ward tested positive for the coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19. The next day doctors doing rounds on their ward asked the nurses why they weren’t wearing N95 masks, Gulick said, and told them they should have better protection.
For Gulick, that was it. He and a handful of nurses told their managers they wouldn’t enter COVID-19 patient rooms without N95 masks. The hospital suspended them, according to the National Nurses Union, which represents them. Ten nurses are now being paid but not allowed to return to work pending an investigation from human resources, the union said.
They are among hundreds of doctors, nurses and other health care workers across the country who say they’ve been asked to work without adequate protection. Some have taken part in protests or lodged formal complaints. Others are buying — or even making — their own supplies.
Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t require N95 masks for COVID-19 caregivers, but many hospitals are opting for the added protection because the infection has proven to be extremely contagious. The CDC said Wednesday at least 9,200 health care workers have been infected.
Saint John’s said in a statement that as of Tuesday it’s providing N95 masks to all nurses caring for COVID-19 patients and those awaiting test results. The statement said the hospital had increased its supply and was disinfecting masks daily.
“It’s no secret there is a national shortage,” said the statement. The hospital would not comment on the suspended nurses.
Angela Gatdula, a Saint John’s nurse who fell ill with COVID-19, said she asked hospital managers why doctors were wearing N95s but nurses weren’t. She says they told her that the CDC said surgical masks were enough to keep her safe.
Then she was hit with a dry cough, severe body aches and joint pain.
“When I got the phone call that I was positive I got really scared,” she said.
She’s now recovering and plans to return to work next week.
“The next nurse that gets this might not be lucky. They might require hospitalization. They might die,” she said.
As COVID-19 cases soared in March, the U.S. was hit with a critical shortage of medical supplies including N95s, which are mostly made in China. In response, the CDC lowered its standard for health care workers’ protective gear, recommending they use bandannas if they run out of the masks.
Some exasperated health care workers have complained to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
“I … fear retribution for being a whistleblower and plead to please keep me anonymous,” wrote a Tennessee medical worker, who complained staffers were not allowed to wear their own masks if they weren’t directly treating COVID-19 patients.
In Oregon, a March 26 complaint warned that masks were not being provided to nurses working with suspected COVID-19 patients. Another Oregon complaint alleged nurses “are told that wearing a mask will result in disciplinary action.”
One New Jersey nurse who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution, said she was looking for a new job after complaining to OSHA.
“Do I regret filing the complaint? No, at least not yet,” she said. “I know it was the right thing to do.”
Some are taking to the streets.
On Wednesday, nurse unions in New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania scheduled actions at their hospitals and posted on social media using hashtag “PPEoverProfit.”
Nurses at Kaiser Permanente’s Fresno Medical Center in central California demanded more protective supplies at a protest during their shift change Tuesday. The hospital, like many in the U.S., requires nurses to use one N95 mask per day, which has raised concerns about bringing the infection from one patient to the next.
Ten nurses from the facility have tested positive with COVID-19, Kaiser said. Three have been admitted to the hospital and one is in critical care, protest organizers said.
Wade Nogy, a Kaiser senior vice president, denied union claims that nurses have been unnecessarily exposed.
“Kaiser Permanente has years of experience managing highly infectious diseases, and we are safely treating patients who have been infected with this virus, while protecting other patients, members and employees,” Nogy said.
Amy Arlund, a critical care nurse at the facility, said that before the pandemic, following infection control protocols they’re currently using would have been grounds for disciplinary action.
“And now it’s like they’ve thrown all those standards out the window as if they never existed,” Arlund said. “It’s beyond me.”

On Saturday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had tested 1,583 people since the first US cases emerged in January. But the CDC is not publicizing real-time information on how many Americans have been tested at state and local levels. According to an exclusive report from The Atlantic on Friday, a total of 1,895 people in the US have been tested for the novel coronavirus. 
Just as Trump's reassurance falls flat, so does America's public-health response to COVID-19, especially compared to public-health responses around the globe. 
Other countries far outpace the US in responding to COVID-19
In South Korea, for instance, more than 140,000 people have been tested for the disease, and 7,382 are infected. 
In the United Kingdom, some 23,513 people have been tested, The Telegraph reported Sunday, and 319 cases have been confirmed.  
While many health agencies have not released the total number of COVID-19 tests conducted, the sheer number of confirmed infections in a given country is telling: It is a good barometer for the extent to which public-health officials have actively addressed the health crisis.
In China, where the novel coronavirus first broke out, there are more than 80,000 confirmed cases. Over a three-week period, the country tested 320,000 people in Guangdong province alone.
As of March 2, Italy had conducted 23,435 tests, according to a Worldometer database. There are currently  7,375 confirmed cases in an outbreak that has compelled a lockdown of 16 million people in Italy's northern region, the BBC reported. 
In the US, 'testing capacity is not currently adequate'
In the United States, experts are urgently calling for increased public-health infrastructure to deal with the national COVID-19 outbreak. Currently, the country is not prepared to meet the scale of the problem. 
""Testing capacity is not currently adequate, and we need more,"" Dr. Lisa Maragakis, an epidemiologist and the senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Health System, told Congress on Friday. 
""We need this as soon as we can have it,"" Maragakis added. 
Her testimony came just days after Vice President Mike Pence announced that the US would significantly increase its testing capacities.
""We have more than 2,500 kits that are being distributed around the country this week that will make more than 1.5 million tests available at hospitals that have requested them,"" Pence said. For each person tested, a  double-swab is needed, which means the 1.5 million test kits could be used to test up to 750,000 people."

They've also tried to pinpoint why some people with the illness find it's no big deal, while others wind up in medically induced comas and on ventilators, if not dead. 
At first, data from China and Italy indicated that older people and those with underlying conditions — namely, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes — were the most vulnerable. But then, in the US and UK, it became clear that young, healthy people could become seriously ill and die, too. 
Now, as the virus hits the US hard, experts are bracing to see how it affects the unique population makeup here: With an obesity rate of 42% compared to China's 6% and Italy's 10%, some fear it could be a perfect storm. 
""I worry that we are going to see a major increase in case fatality rates here in this country compared to what's been seen in some other countries in the world just because of that somewhat unique risk factor to us in the US,"" University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Osterholm said in a March 30 interview with WCCO, a local radio station. 
Jean-François Delfraissy, France's chief epidemiologist, issued a similar warning on April 8. ""This virus is terrible, it can hit young people, in particular obese young people. Those who are overweight really need to be careful,"" Delfraissy told franceinfo radio.
""That is why we're worried about our friends in America, where the problem of obesity is well known and where they will probably have the most problems because of obesity.""
Here's what the research says so far about why being in a bigger body may make you more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19 — and why it may not. 
The rate of obesity is above 20% in every state of the US. In some, nearly half the state population is obese.
Skye Gould/Business Insider
Some reports of obese COVID-19 patients with severe disease are troubling 
Anecdotal reports suggest a disproportionate percentage of the COVID-19 patients in a severe condition are overweight or obese. 
Dr. Robert Eckel, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, told Business Insider that a ""sophisticated internist"" in New York City told him at least 90% of the people under age 50 he's seen ventilated due to COVID-19 were obese. 
Fatima Fakhoury, a weight-inclusive registered dietitian in New York, told Business Insider a colleague in Cornell's surgical intensive-care unit, told her ""every one"" of her 60 ventilated patients in a single day, whether 28 or 85, was obese. ""Call it anecdotal,"" Fakhoury said, ""but these are real people"" reporting the findings. 
Some studies back up such experiences in the field.
A report out April 8 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 48.3% of all patients admitted to the hospitals in 99 counties across the US were obese, and 59% of the 18- to 49-year-olds who were hospitalized were obese. That's startling compared to 40% of 20- to 39-year-olds in the general population who have obesity. 
One not-yet-peer-reviewed study in the Lancet, made available April 1, found the same in China. Looking at 383 COVID-19 patients in China, researchers found that people who were overweight had an 86% higher likelihood or developing severe pneumonia than their normal weight counterparts. Those who were obese were 2.4 times more likely to develop it.
Higher-weight men were particularly at risk, with those who overweight almost twice as likely to develop the condition and those who were obese 5.7 times more likely. 
""Those are really stunning odds ratios,"" Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious disease expert at the Mayo Clinic, told Business Insider. 
As such, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has listed ""severe"" obesity, or a body mass index of 40 or over, as high-risk condition for the illness.
We can't entirely trust current data linking obesity to COVID-19 deaths
A caveat to the conversation about obesity and the coronavirus is that the data is spotty, as it has been across the board since this pandemic began just a few months ago.
New Orleans has a staggeringly high death rate from the virus — twice that of New York City and four times that of Seattle — and doctors have suggested the city's obesity rates may be a factor, according to Reuters.
That doesn't appear to match up with each city's obesity rates, though. New Orleans had an obesity rate of 31.4% in 2010, the last year Business Insider was able to find data. In Seattle, 27% of people were classified as obese in 2009, while 22% of New York City residents are obese.
The same discrepancies have been seen elsewhere. In Louisiana overall, data show 25% of patients who have died from COVID-19 were obese — a lower proportion than the state's obesity rate of 36.2 percent. A study in the UK found that 127 of 196 COVID-19 patients who were in intensive care were overweight or obese. That's about 65%, almost exactly the same percentage seen in the general population. 
But doctors don't need data to be concerned about high obesity rates
Medical professionals don't need geographic data to tell them America's obesity epidemic is a problem going into the fight against the coronavirus. 
Public health researchers have been warning about rising obesity levels across the US for decades. It's a complicated issue, fueled by poverty and lack of healthcare access, and burdened by a stigma. It's driven a rise in the rate of Americans with heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension — comorbidities that are, in turn, connected to serious COVID-19 complications.
Obesity is especially prevalent among non-Hispanic black people — a group already suffering health disparities from the virus — affecting 49.6% in the US.
Some 18.5% of 2- to 19-year-olds are obese in the US. More than 42% of Americans in every state are obese, with the highest rates in the South, which is expected to be worst-hit for myriad reasons. 
""If obesity is another independent risk factor that puts people at higher risk ... it's a pandemic in its own right,"" Eckel said. 
Heart disease and diabetes — conditions linked to obesity — appear to increase the risk of death from COVID-19

BMI, a ratio of weight to height, is an imperfect metric of health. Someone with a ""healthy"" BMI who eats junk food and smokes is less healthy than someone who's technically obese but eats a plant-based diet and manages stress through exercise. But in many cases, high BMI is linked to other health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
And those conditions are all risk factors for serious illness or death from COVID-19. A report on patient characteristics from Italy's National Institute of Health, released on March 17, found that 76.1% of patients who died from COVID-19 had hypertension, or high blood pressure, and 35.5% of COVID-19 patients who died had diabetes. Data from rge CDC found that 32% of patients in in the ICU with the virus had diabetes. 
Weight gain or excess fat, particularly around the belly, is responsible for 60 to 70 percent of cases of hypertension, or high blood pressure, researchers estimate. 
Experts aren't sure why people with cardiovascular conditions are are at a higher risk of dying from the virus, but doctors believe that the strain COVID-19 puts on the lungs may burden the heart as well. People with heart issues may also have weaker immune systems, and the virus could have a negative effect on those with plaque in their arteries, according to the American Heart Association.
Diabetes is another condition that's closely tied with weight: 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. The condition may make COVID-19 worse because some viruses thrive on higher blood glucose levels, and people with diabetes also have compromised immune systems, according to Health.com.

Excess weight can burden the immune and respiratory systems, regardless of underlying conditions  
Even people who are overweight or obese and who don't have an underlying condition like diabetes or high blood pressure may be more susceptible to COVID-19 and more severe complications. That's in part because excess weight can impact the immune system and lung function. 
""At the immunological system level, the human body is extremely poorly adapted to chronic caloric overload,"" Poland said. ""It's as bad for our immune system as malnutrition is."" 
Particularly among people who carry their body fat around the middle, obesity can activate inflammation and weaken the body's anti-inflammatory response, making them more susceptible to illness, research suggests. 
Extra weight around the chest and in the belly can also physically restrict breathing, which can be dangerous with a respiratory condition like COVID-19. 
""Prior to COVID-19, we already knew that obesity is a risk factor for infection in general and more severe complications, and this is particularly true for respiratory infections,"" Poland said.
During the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in 2009, adults with body mass indexes over 30 were 3.1 times more likely to die from the infection than people of lower weights, while adults with body mass indexes over 40 were 7.6 times more likely to die.
Some say warnings about obesity are unnecessary, and will only serve to heighten obese Americans' stress levels
Some dietitians, psychologists, and eating disorder specialists say that there isn't sufficient data on obesity as a COVID-19 risk factor, and that saying so can do their health more harm than good. 
""There's no reason to further stigmatize higher-weight people, who are already a stigmatized group in our society,"" Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian and host of the Food Psych podcast, told Business Insider. ""And, in fact, there's strong evidence that weight stigma increases people's risk of all kinds of diseases by putting physical stress on the body and psychological stress on the person, regardless of their actual body size."" 
But others say it's helpful to consider weight a risk factor, just like age is. 
""It's a difficult situation and an emotional situation since people who are in a certain BMI range are discriminated against. They're right to feel attacked and marginalized,"" Fatima Fakhoury, a weight-inclusive registered dietitian in New York, told Business Insider. ""But in this case, as one example, if somebody in a couple is obese and somebody is not, they both need to be aware that one of them is high risk, and so maybe take extra precautions."" 
People at higher weights should take the same precautions as any potentially vulnerable population — not go on a restrictive diet

People of all sizes should follow similar precautions to protect themselves and their communities: Stay home if possible, practice physical distancing when you must go out, practice excellent hygiene, clean surfaces frequently, and quarantine yourself if you do get sick.
Eat a healthy diet and get some exercise outdoors if possible, and prioritize good sleep and stress management. What you shouldn't do is go on a diet diet or over-exercise, since both behaviors can weaken the immune system. 
""Take care of yourself ... and treat yourself with compassion,"" Harrison said. ""This is a traumatic time, and we're all just doing the best we can.""

Here’s What to Know About Herd Immunity",Experts warn that rushing to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19—through coronavirus parties or otherwise—could have deadly consequences.,https://time.com/5825386/herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Crowd-Herd-Immunity-Covid-19.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,2020-04-24T18:29:10Z,"In recent weeks, all around the world people have started to suggest that intentional exposure to COVID-19 could actually be beneficial for society at large. Discussions on social media about herd immunity have grown louder, and the Swedish government announced on April 22 that it is weeks away from achieving it in Stockholm. Hundreds of people have volunteered to become infected as part of a controversial approach to speed up development of a vaccine, known as a human-challenge trial.
The U.S. has successfully achieved herd immunity from diseases like chickenpox, mumps, polio and measles, but we’re a long way from getting there with COVID-19, experts tell TIME. In fact, trying to build immunity to the coronavirus through exposure rather than waiting for a vaccine to be developed could have deadly consequences.
Scientists do not yet know for certain whether the human body even develops immunity after an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. And, if the body does become immune, there’s no evidence that shows how long immunity to the virus might last after recovery. Based on previous research into other coronaviruses (such as those that cause MERS and SARS), experts do believe it is likely that someone infected with COVID-19 will have some level of immunity after recovering from the illness, but the details are still very much unknown. Which is why, they say, it’s a terrible idea to purposefully expose yourself to infection.
As part of the new TIME 100 Talks: Finding Hope series, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, talked to TIME senior health correspondent Alice Park about herd immunity (among other things), and whether it was achievable with COVID-19.
“We really can’t depend on herd immunity until we get either enough people infected, or enough people vaccinated,” he said during the Thursday interview. That means either a vaccine is developed and the vast majority of people become immune to the virus, or 70-80% of people contract the virus through community spread and develop antibody protection, indirectly protecting the rest of the population that is not yet immune to the virus.
Both of these paths toward herd immunity can theoretically occur in the long-term future, experts say, but one is more deadly than the other.
“Eventually, we [will] achieve herd immunity, but we don’t want that to happen quickly,” says Gypsyamber D’Souza, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There would be so many deaths.”
What is herd immunity?
Exposure to a disease-causing organism triggers the body to produce antibodies, disease-specific proteins that fight off the infection. On first exposure, it can take the body a while to develop the right antibody. However, in many cases, the human immune system retains knowledge of that infectious agent, and if it comes across it again, is able to rapidly deploy these antibodies to fight it off.
When a person develops this sort of antibody-based immunity to a given infectious agent, the likelihood that they will pass it on falls significantly says D’Souza. When 70-80% of a given population develops this antibody protection, herd immunity is achieved, indirectly providing protection to those who are not yet immune.
“It’s enough people being immune that over time the number of infections goes down rather than up,” says David Dowdy, associate professor of epidemiology also at Johns Hopkins University. “There are really only two ways to achieve this level of immunity. One is through development and mass distribution of a vaccine, and the other is through a massive increase in the number of people who get sick.”
In the case of COVID-19, a vaccine is still at least months, and more likely at least a year, away, according to experts on the White House Coronavirus Taskforce, including Fauci. Option two, then, might start to look like a viable option for some, but both D’Souza and Dowdy warn against it.
On April 5, former presidential candidate Andrew Yang shared a tweet saying “An army vet friend suggested that soldiers and vets be allowed to voluntarily get the virus in order to maintain readiness, provide an immune workforce and research antibodies. These guys and gals are hardcore.” On April 16, the Cincinnati Enquirer published an opinion piece by a physician at the University of Cincinnati with the headline “I want my kids to get coronavirus—and you should too,” arguing why Ohio should lead the effort in exposing child populations to the virus in waves. (The physician did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment).
Both D’Souza and Dowdy, though, say intentional exposure to the virus could increase deaths.
Dowdy says researchers think only about 1 to 2% of the U.S. population is currently immune to the virus. “It may be higher in places like New York City, but to get to 1 to 2% [immunity], we’ve already had over 40,000 deaths,” he says. “To get to 70% of the population being immune through natural protection, you’re talking hundreds of thousands of deaths, so not a good idea.”
Should people intentionally expose themselves to COVID-19?
In the days before there was a vaccine for chickenpox, parents used to hold “pox parties,” intentionally exposing their children to chickenpox in an attempt to build up the child’s immunity to the disease. That sort of worked—though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly recommends against hosting such parties, given the risk. And chickenpox is far less deadly than COVID-19 appears to be.
“There’s this impression that lots of people have had [COVID-19] and been just fine, and because we’re not testing some people have a sense that we’re closer to herd immunity then we really are,” says D’Souza.
“We’re talking here about a disease that’s probably 100 times more deadly, at least, than chickenpox. I also feel like people are confusing the idea of individual immunity and herd immunity,” Dowdy adds. “If people are thinking of intentionally exposing themselves, they shouldn’t be thinking in terms of herd immunity, they should be thinking in terms of the risk-benefit to themselves…that’s a big risk to take and not one that I think is a wise choice.”
There are other risk factors to consider with COVID-19. Infectious disease experts don’t yet know how long people can be protected by antibodies after recovering from the disease. There’s also the potential to spread the virus to those who might not be able to recover from it.
“The people you’re going to infect are going to be your friends and family,” Dowdy says. “You’re not just rolling the dice with your own health and life, you are doing the same with those who are closest to you.”
When will we get to herd immunity?
“We will not get to herd immunity in the close future, in the next year or two, but the preventive measures that we’re taking now”—like maintaining social distancing—“are buying us time to develop a vaccine that we can hopefully use to immunize ourselves and get herd immunity that way,” D’Souza says.
And there’s a lot of hope that a vaccine will be developed, though it’ll take time, she adds. “It’s not necessarily a situation of, ‘oh you’re gonna eventually have to get infected.’ We really have a lot of reasons to think that there’s a good chance that a vaccine will be developed,” she says.

But now the tiny city-state, with a population of 5.6 million, has the most reported coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia.
On Monday, officials recorded a new daily record—more than 1,400 additional cases. The number of COVID-19 cases has increased more than two and a half times in the last week, with more than 8,000 total.
Experts say the surge, which began last week, is due largely to local officials underestimating the vulnerability of the city’s migrant workers, who live in cramped dormitories with up to 20 people to a room.
Just 16 of the new cases Monday were Singapore citizens or permanent residents. About three-quarters of all cases in Singapore are linked to the workers’ dormitories, according to official figures.
In the early months of the outbreak, Singapore’s response was praised—alongside those in Hong Kong and Taiwan—as a model for how to stop slow the spread of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) commended Singapore, citing its widespread testing and comprehensive tracing of close contacts.

Singapore had also largely managed to quell a second wave of the virus, caused by students and other residents returning home from the U.S. and Europe. Authorities have only recorded one imported case since April 9.
But Hong Kong and Taiwan now appear to have a much better handle on the outbreak. Hong Kong recorded no new cases Monday, and Taiwan recorded just two. Both also have a fraction of the confirmed infections. (1,025 in Hong Kong and 422 in Taiwan), despite having larger populations.
‘A cognitive blindspot’
An estimated 200,000 migrants workers live in 43 dormitories in Singapore, according to figures from the Ministry of Manpower. Most are from less wealthy nations like India and China, and are employed in low-wage jobs like construction, shipyard work and cleaning.
Between 12 and 20 workers typically live in one room, according to TWC2, a non-profit organization that supports migrant workers in Singapore. They share common facilities, like bathrooms and kitchens.
“The dormitories and management of the migrant workers have been a cognitive blindspot,” says Jeremy Lim, a professor and the co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
“The dorms are structurally not able to provide for the social distancing that is necessary,” Lim, who also works with a local NGO to provide medical care to migrant workers, adds.
Over the last week, authorities have worked to move workers out of their dorms and into vacant public housing blocks, military camps and other accommodations.
Even though the number of infected migrant workers has surged, community-transmitted cases among Singaporeans has been declining, a sign that tough new measures involving the closure of schools, mandatory masking and other policies implemented earlier this month could be working.
But Singapore’s hard-won early victories could easily be undone by the outbreak rampaging through the migrant worker community, Lim warns.
“We are at a critical juncture,” he says. “If we cannot contain the dormitory or the migrant worker outbreaks, it will inevitably spill back into the general population because Singapore is just so small and compact.”

The service will be free of charge for patients thanks to a partnership between the National Health Service (NHS) in South East London and taxi platform Gett. The cabs being used for NHS purposes won't be available to the general public. 
Black Cabs have been chosen for this service due to their ""privacy divider,"" which creates a barrier of separation between the driver and passenger. The cabs will be professionally cleaned between each journey according to NHS standards, a Gett statement confirmed. 
Patients who are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms who need to see a general practitioner (GP) for other non-urgent conditions can make use of the service. Testing for the new coronavirus will not be carried out at these centres. 
SEE ALSO: It took a coronavirus outbreak for self-driving cars to become more appealing
The initiative commissioned by South East London Clinical Commissioning Group will launch in Southwark this week, before being extended to other boroughs in South East London. Initially, the service will operate Monday to Friday between 8 a.m. and 6.30 p.m.
So, how does it work? 
Patients with suspected COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, who have been clinically assessed as needing to see a GP or practice nurse will get a referral for one of the NHS community centres. If the patient cannot travel using their own car, the NHS will pass on their details to Gett who will send a Black Cab to their home.
If a mobile number has been provided, the patient will receive a text message about their vehicle, driver, and journey details. If a landline number is given by the patient, they may receive a phone call. Upon arrival at the NHS community centre, the patient will either be taken inside immediately or assessed while still inside the cab and then brought inside if deemed ""clinically necessary."" 
Once the assessment is complete, patients will either be returned home by the same cab with advice and medication if needed, or ""routed into a different NHS service."" 
What protection measures are in place? 
A professional cleaning of the passenger cabin will be done by the NHS using products and processes advised by Public Health England Infection Control Guidance, carried out wearing full PPE, per the Gett statement. An additional covering of the privacy screen will be provided by the NHS, and any fabric in the vehicle will be covered with a wipeable material. Masks for the passenger and driver will be supplied by the NHS along with alcohol gel for the driver. 
Cab drivers won't be asked to assist patients and any patients needing assistance will receive their healthcare via a different service. Black Cab drivers with certain health conditions won't be allowed to provide this service, in line with NHS guidance. 
Importantly, the service is not available to patients who are not exhibiting coronavirus symptoms who need to see a GP. These patients will need to make their own way to GP surgeries in their area that are still open to patients who don't have coronavirus. 
Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, said London's Black Cab trade is ""proud to be part of this initiative to support Londoners and the NHS by getting people who need to see their GPs to their appointments quickly and safely.""
The idea for the service was proposed by Gavin McColl, a GP in Southwark. ""It is vital that we continue to provide GP services to patients in South East London even if they have COVID-19 symptoms,"" said in a statement. ""This ensures they can get to the dedicated NHS community centres without spreading the disease.""

The virus sometimes causes infection and swelling in the heart and surrounding muscles, which can be fatal.
New research published Friday in the journal JAMA Cardiology concluded that the COVID-19 virus, much like other respiratory viruses, can impact a patient's cardiac system. The study found that even healthy people who contract COVID-19 are at risk of heart injury. 
""It is likely that even in the absence of previous heart disease, the heart muscle can be affected by coronavirus disease,"" Dr. Mohammad Madjid, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of cardiology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, said in a press release.
""Overall, injury to heart muscle can happen in any patient with or without heart disease, but the risk is higher in those who already have heart disease,"" he added.
The link between COVID-19 and cardiac problems
After reviewing an array of existing studies about COVID-19, Madjid and his colleagues affirmed that patients with preexisting heart disease are among those at the greatest risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19.
The scientists concluded that those patients' risks are two-fold: not only do they seem more likely to get infected due to their underlying heart disease, but they are also more likely die from the illness, in part because they develop further heart injuries during infection.

The case fatality, or death rate, for COVID-19 patients with heart disease in mainland China was 10.5% between December 30 and February 11, according to research from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
According to another new study in JAMA Cardiology (which echoed Madjid's group's conclusions), that's because patients with underlying heart disease are more prone to experience myocardial, or heart, injury during the course of their COVID-19 infections. These myocardial injuries include an irregular heartbeat or heart failure.
The study, which examined 187 COVID-19 patients at a hospital in Wuhan, China, revealed that 28% of patients developed a myocardial injury, which was significantly associated with a higher risk of death. About 70% of patients that had both underlying heart disease and developed a heart injury from the virus died.
According to Madjid and his co-authors, COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viruses like the flu and SARS, can exacerbate existing cardiovascular disease and trigger new heart problems in healthy patients.
During most flu epidemics, more patients die of heart problems than respiratory issues like pneumonia, they wrote, adding that they expect similar cardiac issues among severe COVID-19 cases.
One woman with COVID-19 had a heart infection but no respiratory issues
A third study also published Friday in JAMA Cardiology describes the case of a 53-year-old healthy woman without any history of cardiovascular disease or underlying health conditions. She came to the emergency room complaining of severe fatigue in March.
The patient told doctors that she'd had a fever and dry cough the week before, but she had no difficulty breathing and her chest x-rays were clear. The lining of her heart, however, was inflamed and infected, and she was admitted to the cardiac care unit for treatment.
Later, because of her prior symptoms, she was given a coronavirus test. It came back positive.

The study authors wrote that this woman's case ""provides evidence of cardiac involvement as a possible late phenomenon of the viral respiratory infection."" 
The researchers offered two possible explanations about how the COVID-19 virus might impact the heart. The first is that the virus could spread from the lungs through the body via blood or the lympathic system. They added, however, that no incidences of the coronavirus in the heart had been reported yet.
Alternatively, the coronavirus could trigger inflammation in the body, which may cause heart injury.

On average, a patient's symptoms start around five days after exposure to the virus. Nearly 98% develop symptoms within 11.5 days, though about 1% start showing symptoms after 14 days. Within a few days of symptoms appearing, those infected may experience shortness of breath. Many have headaches. About 40% of patients' lungs begin to produce fluid.

Online learning platform edX today announced a new, completely free course on ventilator operation for non-ICU medical professionals being reassigned to ICU units to combat COVID-19.
On top of dangerous shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators, space, and personnel, hospitals also have a critical need for proper training. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" is designed for non-ICU workers who will be joining the front lines in ICUs and other critical care facilities. It was designed by Dr. Susan Wilcox and Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in tandem with Harvard, edX, and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's The Schmidt Family Foundation. 
The entire course can be completed in two to five hours, and it's free to access. All you'll need to do is click ""enroll"".
What the course covers
The course covers the principles and physiology of invasive mechanical ventilation. Among other things, students will learn how to troubleshoot the ventilator, the specifics of ventilating patients in special circumstances like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Obstructive Lung Disease, and how standard ventilation practices are different for COVID-19 patients.
""There are reasons to opt for early intubation for COVID-19 patients (reduces the risk of aerosolization of the virus), so we are focusing on that."" Harvard University explained in a statement. ""[The course] is more about patient monitoring and treatment options that non-specialists may not be familiar with than the mechanics of operating a machine.""

The minds behind the course
Its architects, Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino, are immersed in the fight against the new coronavirus. Dr. Wilcox is Division Chief of Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is leading the team addressing a remarkable influx of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Piraino is the Clinical Specialist for Mechanical Ventilation for the Centre of Excellence in Mechanical Ventilation at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" was borne out of a desire to help their own teams, as well as the thousands of other healthcare workers around the globe who find themselves in exactly the same spot, especially as some cities may be nearing an apex.
A succinct, zero-fee online course is an efficient means for disseminating critical and universally useful information to as many healthcare professionals as possible, regardless of location. And that's Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino pulled the class together in just two weeks — on top of hours of emotionally and physically grueling hospital work.
""These are my heroes,"" MIT professor and edX founder and CEO Anant Agarwal told Business Insider. ""Actual heroes.""
The course could have a global impact
On top of its immediate usage, edX hopes ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" may prove useful longterm. It has edX's standard feature of a discussion forum, in which healthcare professionals can find meaningful support amongst peers as well as a space to discuss treatments, observations, and even create trends of discussion that may be localized down to country-specific issues. The forum will be moderated by HarvardX and a medical expert who can ""pin"" the most useful questions and answers to the top of the forum for easy reference to good information. 
Most edX courses are offered in English, but Agarwal told Business Insider that the company would attempt to make transcripts of ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" available in multiple languages now that the company isn't moving at warp speed to get the course out as soon as possible. 
""This effort is one of many examples of the type of community collaboration that will be required to combat the spread of COVID-19,"" Thomas Piraino said in edX's April 6 press release. ""As the entire global medical community works together to combat this pandemic, I'm proud to work with Dr. Wilcox to create a course that's universally helpful to all medical professionals in this situation.""

 For weeks, President Trump has been giving daily briefings on the US pandemic response, often running more than two hours and often lashing out against perceived critics or veering off into attacks on sitting governors.
But while the hours of briefings have been frustrating for reporters, they’ve been unexpectedly good for content.
One audio clip from earlier this month has gone unexpectedly viral on TikTok, racking up more than 250 videos and more than a million views over the past week. The clip captures the president expounding on the brilliance of the novel coronavirus in both a vague and an authoritative way:

You can see the original briefing here. The speech came in response to a question about making coronavirus testing priority for food processing workers, which was linked to an outbreak in Denver. The president responded that testing needs are difficult to anticipate, which pivoted into a broader disposition on the sinister brilliance of the virus.
This is a brilliant enemy. They develop drugs like the antibiotics. Antibiotics used to solve every problem, and now one of the biggest problems the world has is, the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it. They’re constantly trying to come up with a new... People go to a hospital and they catch... they go for a heart operation — that’s no problem — but they end up dying from.... from problems, you know the problems I’m talking about. There’s a whole genius to it, we’re fighting, not only is it hidden but it’s very smart. And you see that in a case like Denver.

In broad strokes, he’s talking about antibiotic resistance, which is a real and scary problem, but it has nothing to do with the current pandemic. (Antibiotics fight bacterial infections like pneumonia, not viruses like the novel coronavirus.) So while it’s natural to wonder if a clip like this is taken out of context, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense in context either.
Some doctors have even gotten in on the meme, using the audio as a stand-in for an unprepared medical student.

Nunneley,COVID-19 vaccine candidates: 6 front-runners,Vaccines are especially needed by health care workers on the front lines.,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-19-vaccine-candidates-front-runners/story?id=69881230,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/covid-testing-ap-jef-200331_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,2020-03-31T18:28:41Z,"As the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country, those who are not infected can protect themselves by avoiding close contact with others and aggressively washing their hands. But beyond this, many are desperately hoping for another form of protection: a vaccine.
Vaccines work by exposing our bodies to something that resembles a certain pathogen, training our immune systems to recognize, attack and kill the invader. When presented with the real pathogen itself, our immune armies are ready to fight.
While not a treatment or cure, vaccines can help eradicate a disease by starving the virus of people to infect and transmit the disease.
Vaccines are especially needed by health care workers on the front lines and other vulnerable members of the population who have a higher risk of contracting the infection.
While the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is well underway with over 40 hopeful candidates, only three have entered Phase I of clinical trials, the first of three stages of human testing before drug approval.
Phase I testing is only a test to see if the vaccine is safe. Researchers won't know if it's effective until Phase II is studied. Below is a brief overview of these three candidates, plus three promising ones that are still in earlier stages of development.
STARTING IN HUMANS (PHASE 1) 
mRNA-1273: The front-runner in the U.S., which is backed by the NIAID and developed by Moderna Therapeutics, is based upon a specific type of genetic material, mRNA. This vaccine, mRNA-1273, codes for a specific protein on the novel coronavirus -- the spike protein the key into a human cell. An mRNA-based virus has never been approved for use in humans, but animal studies have been promising. This particular vaccine, however, was rushed to human trials before it was even tested in animals -- skipping a step in traditional vaccine development.
A Phase I trial testing the vaccines safety in 45 healthy adult volunteers began earlier this month at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The participants will receive two injections of low, medium or high doses of the vaccine and be monitored for any adverse events or immune response. The company is hopeful that it may have a vaccine as early as fall 2020 for some particularly vulnerable groups, such as health care workers. The Phase I safety study should be completed by June 2021.

Ad5-nCoV: The front-runner across the globe, Ad5-nCoV, was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotech and CanSino Biologics, a Chinese biopharmaceutical company. This vaccine uses a viral vector, a virus that has been engineered to not contain its infectious properties and instead delivers genetic material to the recipient. Phase I testing of this vaccine is underway at Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, where 108 healthy adult volunteers will receive one of three doses of the vaccine to assess for safety. Ad5-nCoV is perhaps the most promising because CanSino has already produced a nearly identical vaccine, Ad5-EBOV, to protect against Ebola. The Ebola vaccine has already entered Phase II testing, meaning its even further along. Still, the official anticipated completion date for Ad5-nCOV safety testing is December 2020, with all testing completed by 2022.
ChAdOx1: The University of Oxford is one of the most recent groups to bring its vaccine candidate into human studies -- a major milestone. The vaccine is simultaneously being tested for both safety (Phase I) and efficacy (Phase II) by injecting 510 healthy participants with either vaccine or placebo. This vaccine uses an inactivated (non-infectious) virus that contains genetic material for the key protein on the novel coronavirus, similar to Ad5-nCoV in China. This viral vector, however, was derived from chimpanzees which, the researchers argue, creates an even more robust response than other viruses to which humans may have already been exposed. This vaccine is being funded by the United Kingdom government and is moving quickly. Still, its anticipated completion date of this phase isnt until May 2021.
STILL IN LABORATORY (PRECLINICAL)
BNT162: Biopharmaceutical giant Pfizer, along with partner company BioNTech, is working on an mRNA-based vaccine that is similar to Modernas model. The duo was already working on an influenza vaccine using this scientific strategy so their vaccine candidate, BNT162, is moving particularly fast. Clinical trials are anticipated to begin in April in both the U.S. and Germany.
INO-4800: An entirely different technology is being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a company that uses a proprietary platform for activation immunotherapy. This vaccine delivers DNA, another genetic material, into a hosts cells by utilizing a hand-held smart device CELLECTRA. The DNA is translated into proteins that activate an individuals immune system to generate a targeted immune response. While that may sound like science fiction, the company has used the same technology to rapidly advance vaccines against MERS, a closely related coronavirus, and HPV-related cervical precancer, among others. None of these, however, have completed their trial phase and entered the market. Trials for the COVID-19 specific vaccine, INO-4800, are anticipated to begin in April.
Sanofi recombinant DNA vaccine (unnamed): Last month, Sanofi Pasteur announced that it was partnering with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to create a DNA-based vaccine. Their vaccine, which is yet to be named, relies on recombinant (engineered) DNA that encodes for proteins found on COVID-19 surface -- the same basic principle of many of the other candidates. The company had been previously working on a vaccine for SARS, a close relative of the novel coronavirus, which showed promise in animal models. More importantly, however, Sanofi has proved immensely successful in the vaccine market: they have influenza vaccines, including Flublok and Fluzone, that are widely in use today. They claim that their technique -- and their experience with mass production of their products -- would allow a COVID-19 vaccine to be introduced much more quickly than traditional production methods. Still, human trials are yet to begin but will likely start in April.

By now most Americans have gotten the message that, as much as possible, they need to stay away from everyone else. In San Francisco and a growing number of other cities around the world, all non-essential travel has been banned. Even in cases where life more closely resembles normalcy, the government has encouraged social distancing. And if anyone in your life isnt yet under self-quarantine, sending them this brutal essay by Jeff Wise ought to do the trick. Its a plausible account of how you might contract COVID-19 even while doing your best to wash your hands and minimize social contacts; the prose is so sharp and severe that I almost found it cruel.
OK, so youre social distancing; Im social distancing. Hows everyone else doing? Its a question we all have a vested interest in answering, from government and elected officials managing the outbreak to everyday citizens wondering how long were all going to be caged up. But the fatally slow rollout of testing in the United States has made it much harder than it should be to trace the path of the disease throughout the country. And so the government has begun to consider other solutions. 
Tech solutions.
Heres Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin, and Craig Timberg this week in the Washington Post: 
The U.S. government is in active talks with Facebook, Google and a wide array of tech companies and health experts about how they can use location data gleaned from Americans phones to combat the novel coronavirus, including tracking whether people are keeping one another at safe distances to stem the outbreak.
Public-health experts are interested in the possibility that private-sector companies could compile the data in anonymous, aggregated form, which they could then use to map the spread of the infection, according to three people familiar with the effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the project is in its early stages.
You dont have to be a dues-paying member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation to shiver at some of the implications here. The government is going to monitor your location to ensure youre staying a safe distance away from people most of the time? Even if the data was anonymized as promised, it still might seem like a dangerous precedent to set. When else might the government ask to track our phones?
Given the sensitivity people have had lately around the potential misuse of their Facebook data in particular, it makes sense that this was the first question Mark Zuckerberg got yesterday during his briefing with the press. As it turns out, Facebook has made aggregated, anonymized location data available to academic researchers. Issie Lapowsky wrote about the program on Tuesday in Protocol: 
Andrew Schroeder is vice president of research and analysis at Direct Relief, an international disaster relief organization based in Santa Barbara. Since 2017, Schroeder has been using mapping tools developed by Facebooks Data for Good team to track population movements during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. These maps use aggregated, de-identified location data from Facebook users who have location history turned on in their Facebook apps. Some 125 nonprofits and research institutions around the world have access to them. Schroeder has used them to track evacuation efforts during Californias wildfires and map the cholera outbreak in Mozambique.
But as social distancing efforts have swept the country over the last week, Schroeder began to realize that the same tools hes used to track where people in crisis are moving could also be used to track whether theyre staying put.
Schroeder told Protocol that he plans to begin sharing a daily briefing with the California Department of Public Health with his findings.
But Facebook isnt sharing data directly with the government. Were not aware of any active conversations or asks with the U.S. or other governments at this point asking for access to that data directly, Zuckerberg said on Wednesdays call. So I think some of those reports might have just been rehashing the disease prevention maps projects that weve been doing in the past. 
That would seem to explain the Facebook part of the story. But how about Google? Heres what the company said when I asked. (It was the same thing the company told the Post.)
Were exploring ways that aggregated anonymized location information could help in the fight against COVID-19. One example could be helping health authorities determine the impact of social distancing, similar to the way we show popular restaurant times and traffic patterns in Google Maps. This work would follow our stringent privacy protocols and would not involve sharing data about any individuals location, movement, or contacts. We will provide more details when available.
Im told that this work is in the very early stages of development. At the moment, Google hasnt shared any anonymized location data with the government, and has no plans to join in on an industry effort should one materialize. 
In short, whatever conversations may have been had between Big Tech and the government recently, it doesnt seem like its going to lead to the direct sharing of location data. Still, Sen. Ed Markey, D-MA, sent a letter to the office of the chief technology officer of the United States on Thursday with questions about how the CTO planned to use any such data. Although I agree that we must use technological innovations and collaboration with the private sector to combat the coronavirus, we cannot embrace action that represents a wholesale privacy invasion, particularly when it involves highly sensitive and personal location information.
Of course, other governments have no such compunctions about the use of surveillance. For example, heres the scene in Israel, according to the Posts Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash:
Four hundred Israelis looked at their cellphones Wednesday night and discovered just how closely their government is keeping tabs on them during the coronavirus crisis. The countrys Health Ministry had sent tailored text alerts telling citizens that a digital review of their movements showed they had been in proximity to a person known to have tested positive for the virus.
It was not just an advisory. The text also delivered an instant quarantine order, in keeping with ever tightening restrictions dictated by the Israeli government. You must immediately go into isolation [for 14 days] to protect your relatives and the public, the notice said.
And heres whats happening in England, via Sky News Alexander Martin:
The government is working with mobile network O2 to analyse anonymous smartphone location data to see whether people are following its social distancing guidelines, Sky News has learned.
Ministers and officials believe they can use anonymous mobile phone location data to analyse how Londoners have reacted to its guidance on social distancing and the new transport restrictions.
One lesson from all this is that if a tech giant ever tells a government that it cant have a data set, theres likely a telecom in that country that will be happy to give it away or sell it. Another is that were about to learn a lot about the effectiveness of varying technological approaches to addressing the pandemic. Again, it would be best for everyone in the United States if the company began testing people for COVID-19 with the diligence that other modern nations have. But if that effort continues to lag, we would do well to push harder on developing alternatives.

The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here.
[Ed. note: Todays newsletter and column was written and distributed before Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan published his 1,300-word plan to address the security and privacy issues related to the companys unprecedented consumer growth. What follows is unedited because email is forever.]
Just in time for one backlash against the technology industry to end or at least pause a fresh set of concerns has arrived to occupy our attention. Zoom, the once-obscure enterprise video chat app company, rocketed to prominence as COVID-19 forced tens of millions of Americans and most of Silicon Valley to begin working, schooling, and socializing at home. Like lots of people, Im now on Zoom for multiple hours a day. But with all that new usage comes heightened scrutiny and in the first weeks of the Great Social Distancing, Zoom has repeatedly come up short.
The first problem was the Zoombombings. I dont know if I was the first victim of this, but I was certainly one of them. My friend Hunter and I started a virtual happy hour a few weeks ago, and after we tweeted the links, some trolls kept stopping by to take over our screens and share porn. We quickly learned how to fix the problem, but Zoombombings continue every day. The FBI is looking into it, and so is the New York attorney generals office. The problem is that Zoom allows people who have joined your call to share their own screens by default, and the controls for changing this setting are difficult to find.
The second problem was that Zoom began to generate directories of every email address that signed into a call and then let strangers start placing video calls to one another. As with screen sharing disabled by default, this was arguably a feature that made sense for intra-company chats but not for broadcast. Joseph Cox had the story at Vice:
The issue lies in Zooms Company Directory setting, which automatically adds other people to a users lists of contacts if they signed up with an email address that shares the same domain. This can make it easier to find a specific colleague to call when the domain belongs to an individual company. But multiple Zoom users say they signed up with personal email addresses, and Zoom pooled them together with thousands of other people as if they all worked for the same company, exposing their personal information to one another.
I was shocked by this! I subscribed (with an alias, fortunately) and I saw 995 people unknown to me with their names, images and mail addresses. Barend Gehrels, a Zoom user impacted by the issue and who flagged it to Motherboard, wrote in an email.
The third problem was that Zoom ran around telling everyone that its platform is end-to-end encrypted, when in fact it had redefined end-to-end encryption without telling anyone. Micah Lee and Yael Grauer had the story in The Intercept:
As long as you make sure everyone in a Zoom meeting connects using computer audio instead of calling in on a phone, the meeting is secured with end-to-end encryption, at least according to Zooms website, its security white paper, and the user interface within the app. But despite this misleading marketing, the service actually does not support end-to-end encryption for video and audio content, at least as the term is commonly understood. Instead it offers what is usually called transport encryption, explained further below. [...]
The encryption that Zoom uses to protect meetings is TLS, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites. This means that the connection between the Zoom app running on a users computer or phone and Zooms server is encrypted in the same way the connection between your web browser and this article (on https://theintercept.com) is encrypted. This is known as transport encryption, which is different from end-to-end encryption because the Zoom service itself can access the unencrypted video and audio content of Zoom meetings. So when you have a Zoom meeting, the video and audio content will stay private from anyone spying on your Wi-Fi, but it wont stay private from the company. (In a statement, Zoom said it does not directly access, mine, or sell user data.)
There are other problems. Like, it turns out Zoom evades MacOS administrator controls to install itself without you having to ask your boss for permission. And there is a way to steal someones Windows credentials over Zoom by sharing hyperlinks, although arguably that is more of a Windows problem than a Zoom problem. To round out the list, a security researcher on Wednesday found two additional ways to exploit Zoom and wrote about them on his blog.
At this point, you may be wondering what Zoom has to say about all this. Over at Protocol, David Pierce talks to Zooms chief marketing officer, Janine Pelosi, about the past few weeks. He writes:
The product wasnt designed for consumers, Zoom CMO Janine Pelosi told me, but a whole lot of consumers are using it. Thats forced Zoom to evaluate a lot about the platform, but especially its default privacy settings.
On the surface, this sounds reasonable. Zoom is a business tool, but its now being used outside of businesses, and so new vulnerabilities have emerged. And yet that argument is challenged by all of the problems above, which basically resolve to this: in order to make a popular video chat app, you have to make it extremely easy to use. 
In other words, you have to make it a consumer app.
In the old days the 1990s, basically the tools you used for work were decided by your workplace. They bought you your computer, and your license for Microsoft Office, and whatever other arcane and generally awful-to-use programs you needed to get your job done. 
That all changed once people got mobile phones and could begin using whichever programs they wanted to. A new class of productivity tools arose emphasizing design and ease of use: Google Docs, Box, Dropbox, and Evernote led the way, with Trello, Asana, and Slack following a few years afterward. These were tools built for work, but they were designed for consumers. Its why they succeeded.
Zoom learned that lesson, and has applied it consistently since its founding in 2011. Designing for consumers is why, for example, Zoom goes to such great lengths to install itself on your Mac without you having to get permission from an admin. Designing for consumers is why Zoom tries to generate a company director on your behalf. Designing for consumers is why Zoom allows you to log in with Facebook. (Something else it got in trouble forperhaps wrongly this week.) 
And to be clear, designing for consumers has been a good choice for Zoom. It helped the company grow much faster than the competition most notably Skype, which seems to have been caught flat-footed by the moment. Zoom has so much momentum at this moment that creating virtual backgrounds for your calls a fun and distinctive and extremely consumer-y feature of the product has suddenly become a key marketing platform for Hollywood.
Consumer-grade ease of use is essential for a tool like Zoom but so is enterprise-grade security. Thats what its business customers are paying for, after all, and its why Zoom is going to have to start shoring up its platform in a hurry. Ben Thompson has a good idea for stopping the Zoomlash in its tracks:
Freeze feature development and spend the next 30 days on a top-to-bottom review of Zooms approach to security and privacy, followed by an update of how the company is re-allocating resources based on that review.
That wont stop the occasional zero-day exploit from popping up. But it would go a long way toward demonstrating that the company understands the stakes of our new world and is prepared to act accordingly. Zooms problem has never been that, as its chief marketing officer says, it wasnt designed for consumers. The problem is that it was.

Democrats are worried that Googles ban against most ads related to COVID-19, from nongovernmental organizations, could help Trump get re-elected. They say it allows the President to run ads promoting his response to the crisis while denying Democrats the chance to run ads criticizing this response. Emily Birnbaum at Protocol reports:
Prominent Democratic PACs in recent days have funneled millions of dollars into television ads accusing Trump of mishandling the coronavirus crisis. But staffers of several Democratic nonprofits and digital ad firms realized this week that they would not be able to use Googles dominant ad tools to spread true information about President Trumps handling of the outbreak on YouTube and other Google platforms. The company only allows PSA-style ads from government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and trusted health bodies like the World Health Organization. Multiple Democratic and progressive strategists were rebuked when they tried to place Google ads criticizing the Trump administrations response to coronavirus, officials within the firms told Protocol.

A spokeswoman told Business Insider it's seen a huge reduction in viral forwarded messages.
""Since putting into place this new limit, globally there has been a 70% reduction in the number of highly forwarded messages sent on WhatsApp. This change is helping keep WhatsApp a place for personal and private conversations,"" she said. 
The private messaging service announced in early April that it was placing limits on the mass-forwarding of messages in an effort to stop misinformation about the coronavirus winging its way around the world.

Something is loading.
Specifically, it placed a new limit on ""frequently forwarded"" messages — which it defines as messages which have already been forwarded on five times. The change meant such messages could only be forwarded to one chat at a time rather than en masse.
""We've seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. We believe it's important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation,"" WhatsApp said in a blog post on April 7.
WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, meaning the company can't actually read the content of people's messages. That's better for privacy and trust, but also makes it tough to track the spread of misinformation via private messages. The platform is long thought to have contributed to misinformation — in one eye-opening example, inaccurate forwarded messages on WhatsApp about child abduction resulted in lynchings in India.
Social media has become a hotbed for coronavirus conspiracy theories, some of which have led to real-world harm.
Facebook was forced to shut down two groups on its platform which were encouraging members to sabotage phone masts due to a conspiracy theory that the virus is being spread or accelerated by 5G."

A group of scientists at the Swiss university École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne is building an app called ""Coughvid"" that would listen to people cough and use AI to determine whether they sound like a coronavirus patient.
Tomas Teijeiro, one of the researchers, told Business Insider that the app was inspired by reports from doctors that COVID-19 patients had a cough with a distinctive sound — a chirping intake of breath at the end — that differed from other illnesses.
""We have a lot of contact with medical doctors and some of them told us that they usually were able to distinguish, quite well, from sound of the cough, if patients were probably infected,"" Teijeiro told Business Insider.
The team behind Coughvid is still collecting data to train its AI, Teijeiro said. They've gathered more than 15,000 audio samples of people coughing, 1,000 of which came from people who reported being diagnosed with COVID-19. Once completed, the Coughvid app could be used as a tool to recommend whether users should seek out a coronavirus test or further treatment.
Coughvid is just one of many potential coronavirus solutions being pulled together by AI labs eager to find algorithmic solutions to the epidemic. As The Wall Street Journal reported last week, at least three other labs are also developing AI-powered apps that analyze subjects' breathing, speaking, and coughing in an attempt to predict coronavirus, partnering with researchers at schools including Carnegie Mellon University and New York University.
Critics have complained that the tech community is leaping to provide flashy solutions to coronavirus that could have unintended negative consequences. Cambridge computer science professor Ross Anderson told Business Insider last week that he's concerned such solutions could further overload emergency resources if they lead people with mild symptoms to worry more about the virus.
But Teijeiro told Business Insider that the app is still in early development, and that public health experts are being consulted to determine how best to deploy it. He said data collection will likely continue for at least two months before any product is deployed.
""For now, we have this nice hypothesis. There are other work groups working on more or less the same approach, so we think it has a point,"" Teijeiro said. ""Soon we will be able to say more clearly if it's something that's right for the moment.""

A team of engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, designed and built the ventilator in just 37 days. The device, called VITAL (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally), uses one-seventh of the parts required for a conventional ventilator. That makes it easier to mass produce quickly.
NASA administrators said they would offer a free license to help get the device into hospitals faster. That could help emergency-response departments prepare for future influxes of COVID-19 patients, which experts expect to see once lockdowns across the country begin to lift.
""Intensive-care units are seeing COVID-19 patients who require highly dynamic ventilators,"" Dr. J.D. Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, said in a press release. ""The intention with VITAL is to decrease the likelihood patients will get to that advanced stage of the disease and require more advanced ventilator assistance.""
A prototype of the ventilator was tested at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, where the school's Human Simulation Lab simulated a range of patient conditions.
""The testing was outstanding,"" Dave Gallagher, a JPL associate director who worked with the team, said in a press call on Thursday.
The team has submitted an application for emergency use authorization from the FDA, Gallagher said, and expects approval within 48 hours.
NASA improvised parts to avoid supply-chain issues
VITAL uses parts borrowed from other industries.
NASA/JPL-Caltech
To avoid disrupting the supply chain for conventional ventilators, which have already been in short supply, NASA's engineers opted for a design that requires fewer parts than a conventional ventilator and relies on different machinery.
Loading
Something is loading.
""They're really parts from other industries that can be used with this application,"" Gallagher said.
The hope is that manufacturers could produce the device without detracting from the production of conventional ventilators. 
""They're not parts that you would normally necessarily use in building up a ventilator,"" Dr. J.D. Polk, NASA's Chief Health and Medical Officer, said in the briefing. ""There's close to 700 parts out there that we're not using and not having to compete with the supply chain.""
Though the officials did not offer an exact cost for producing the ventilator, Gallagher estimated that it would be roughly $2,000 to $3,000. For comparison, General Motors is producing low-cost ventilators for the national stockpile at more than $16,000 apiece.
Preventing ventilator shortages in the next waves of COVID-19
Doctors at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City give a thumbs up after testing NASA's ventilator prototype.
Human Simulation Lab at the Ichan School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York
Though many cities, counties, and states across the US seem to have passed the peaks of their first waves of coronavirus cases, this is not the end of the battle. As local governments loosen restrictions, business open, and people start to mingle again, the virus will spread. Experts say that will bring new waves of infection, which can get out of control if they aren't closely monitored and cut short with additional lockdowns.
Any place in which these subsequent waves of infection overwhelm local hospitals could see ventilator shortages. 
That's what almost happened in New York City in late March and early April. In Italy, ventilator shortages have been so bad that doctors have reportedly had to decide which patients to prioritize for the treatment.
""The one horrific decision I never want to have to make is who gets a ventilator and who doesn't,"" Dr. Hooman Poor, a physician at Mount Sinai, previously told Business Insider. ""That's a horrifying situation.""
If NASA's new device can be widely produced and distributed across the globe — still two big ifs — it could prevent that situation from arising again.
""It's a crazy project,"" Michelle Easter, an engineer on the JPL team that designed the ventilator, said in a NASA video. ""We have the potential to save human lives, people that we might know, our neighbors, our families.""

My temperature started to rise, and I lost my sense of smell and my taste completely. Even now, in April, I still haven't entirely recovered my taste and smell.
Once it became apparent that I was almost definitely suffering from the coronavirus, I called the number the government had recommended.
No answer.
Days later, I was finally able to contact my health center.

I outlined my symptoms for the doctor and he confirmed my fears: I had COVID-19.
That same doctor advised me to keep an eye on my breathing and to take over-the-counter painkillers for the pain. He also asked me to stay home and not to visit any medical centers.
Once my doctors realized I was only continuing to deteriorate, I ended up being told to come in and get examined. So I did, despite my feverish state and poor condition.
The medications I was instructed to take.

The healthcare facilities were absolute chaos.
As well as being filled with people, the toilets were overflowing.
That said, it wasn't long before I was sent to a consultation room, where a respiratory specialist informed me that my lungs looked clean.
I was, again, advised to keep an eye on my breathing.
The next day, I started to feel even worse.
I decided to go directly to my private hospital and was surprised to find the ER completely empty.

There was no one there apart from myself and two other women.
At first, we looked at each other in fear, thinking we might catch something worse than the other had.
However, after a few minutes, we began to talk, sharing our experiences. It was helpful for us to be able to talk and to let off some steam.
Again, it didn't take long for me to be seen. I was given a lung X-Ray and the doctor told me that, luckily, my lungs were fine, despite the fact that I had been suffering from acute bronchitis associated with COVID-19.
Once again, I was asked to constantly monitor my breathing. I would need to be admitted if the virus entered deeper into my lungs. The medical attention I received over the phone was good at all times.

After deciding to go to the private hospital, doctors there prescribed me both antibiotics and bronchodilators. I'm glad I went to the private hospital, as I don't know what would have happened to me had I not done so.
When I still wasn't sure if I had the virus or not, I stopped reading and watching the news. I find it simply addles your head even more and leaves you feeling more agitated and anxious.
I tried to isolate myself as much as possible from my family, so as not to infect my wife and kids, but it is really near impossible to do so entirely (unless you live in a palace).
I was told to stay home and not to visit any form of medical center but I ended up needing to get further help.
Business Insider España / C. Merino
I couldn't help but think how helpless my other family members might be feeling, being so far away from me.
Thankfully, everything started to improve after the third day of taking antibiotics. I started to see a light at the end of the tunnel and feeling like myself again.
Even if it's a long process, my advice to anyone affected by the coronavirus is to stay as calm as you can.
And one thing I've learned is that, as much as they tell you to stay home, if you see no improvement, you may need to consider going to the hospital to see a doctor.

""Some of these places are not even meeting the minimum threshold criteria that was put out in the Trump White House Coronavirus Task Force Guidance. I'm worried that we don't know enough about how the virus has penetrated these communities and their states."" 
She added: ""We don't know about the possibility for explosive spread of the virus as people go back into these social gathering settings: the workplace, schools, whatever.""
Hamburg went on to say she hoped state leaders would ""think carefully"" moving forward, arguing they need to move more slowly and with more ""adequate testing capability to identify those who are infected."" 
—TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 21, 2020
""We have been behind where we should be in terms of testing and that has made it really hard for us to even fully understand nature/scope of this epidemic,"" she said.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has said businesses including salons, gyms, and bowling alleys will be able to open Friday, followed by movie theaters and restaurants.
This week, Georgia reported 94 additional COVID-19 deaths and 1,242 new coronavirus infections, WJXT reported.
President Trump last week announced the White House's three-phase plan to guide state leaders into choosing when to re-open industries that have been shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a previous Business Insider report, states were guided to meet a host of criteria before relaxing guidelines:
<ul><li>Symptoms of COVID-19, as well as symptoms of influenza-like illnesses, in decline for 14 days.</li><li>A downward trajectory of cases within a two-week period, or a decrease in the percentage of positive tests within the period.</li><li>Hospitals must be treating all patients without crisis care and have a ""robust"" testing process available for vulnerable workers.</li></ul>""I'm perplexed that we have opened up in this way,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Monday night during an appearance on CNN.
She added: ""And, again, I can't stress enough, I work very well with our governor, and I look forward to having a better understanding of what this reasoning is, but as I look at the data and as I talk with our public health officials, I don't see that it's based on anything that is logical.""
Protests have emerged around the nation, as state residents demand their leaders re-open businesses that have been shuttered by the novel coronavirus, which has infected at least 788,920 people in the US and killed 42,458.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Monday he would not extend his ""safer-at-home"" order, which expires on April 30. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine plans to allow many businesses in the state to open when his stay-at-home order expires, on May 1. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said Monday department stores other businesses, like flower shops, previously deemed nonessential would be allowed to reopen Tuesday. Beaches in the state were also allowed to re-open on Tuesday.

She is the author of Global Health Justice and Governance from Oxford University Press and served previously both as Health Economist and Speechwriter to the President at the World Bank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump appears to have wavered on last month's goal to have the US ""opened up and just raring to go by Easter"" as well as his warning on Twitter back then that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF."" 
Larry Kudlow, the President's top economic advisor concurred, adding ""the President is right. The cure can't be worse than the disease. And we're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs."" He counseled that ""[t]he economic cost to individuals is just too great.""
I agree that the economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic are massive and growing. But the social and human costs are even higher and unequally distributed, hitting the vulnerable the most.
Whereas Covid-19 was a natural threat, the ensuing global pandemic and disruptions to the economy and our social way of life is a human-made calamity. We had a duty to prevent Covid-19 as economically as possible and we failed to fulfil it. 
There is no paradox here. In 1948, Albert Camus wrote in ""The Plague"" that ""everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky."" Pandemics are not preordained and the risks have always been sizable. A 2013 World Bank paper cited estimates that a single severe flu pandemic could cost $3 trillion or 4.8% of global GDP. The same paper cited estimates that if all countries developed and implemented systems for early effective contagion control that met specified international standards, annual spending would be moderate, costing ""ten times less than the expected annual cost of inaction."" 
Let's face it, pandemic risk reduction was not a priority for the United States, or many other countries either, with an uneven focus on present-day patients rather than the prospectively sick. Pandemic risk reduction is a global public good, benefiting all countries. Reducing pandemic risk is a public service -- a duty -- which only governments, through the management and coordination of multifaceted sectors and local, national and global levels, can deliver. 
National governments should anticipate and prepare for pandemic risks well in advance. The US and other countries have a duty of early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective prevention and control of disease outbreak, both humanely and efficiently. Saving lives and safeguarding our economy are twin goals that are complementary, not contradictory, and the dichotomy some are presenting is a false one. Pandemic preparedness can have high economic returns.
I previously worked at the World Bank. I served as a health economist and then speechwriter to the World Bank president and led communications in the office of the president. Working at a development institution with a whole-of-society purview, it became clear that health risks are integrally linked to other types of risk, including our ability to work, to be educated and to engage socially with our friends and family. 
Systematic economic shocks constitute shifts in demand and supply as well as social and economic disruption. Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic is cascading across virtually every aspect of our lives; we have every possible reason to act humanely and efficiently. 
Whole-of-society pandemic preparedness is a relatively low-cost set of activities that mitigates the high-cost impacts on human health, society and, yes, the economy. 
What does cost-effective systemic resilience to pandemic impact look like? It's multi-faceted and complex, of course, but select components of a rational and logical approach to health and the economy include the following:
First, we need scientifically-grounded risk assessments and response plans that are rigorously designed and tested. Governments should run intermittent simulations, honing and updating response plans accordingly. 
Second, rational, truthful and transparent public communication in non-urgent as well as urgent times improves preparedness. That way, the public is primed to act based on motivation and factual information rather than fear and anxiety. Taiwan and Singapore's public messaging following the SARS pandemic as well as during the rapid onset of Covid-19 are good examples of effective communication. 
Third, governments should coordinate a centralized response, integrating national security and risk management systems, and set out clear, pre-defined roles among various departments and agencies. For example, Singapore had an inter-agency task force for years, which paved the way for a coordinated national testing, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine and communication strategy during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The US was challenged in all of these necessary activities, leading to a scenario closer to bad than good -- namely the rapid growth of cases. International coordination is also key, with allies, neighbors and, particularly, trading partners. For example, Taiwan visited China for a fact-finding mission, aiding its response. 
Fourth, accountable and unified leadership at the highest levels -- not just during crises, but between them -- renders a country more prepared, resilient and ready to act swiftly and decisively. 
Last, but certainly not least, underpinning all of these efforts is a strong One Health system, a local, national and global multi-sectoral collaboration focused on obtaining optimal health for people, animals and the environment. This system reinforces the bridge between veterinary and human health systems, for early, effective contagion control.
Both whole-of-society preparedness and One Health planning are relatively low-cost, high-return approaches to pandemic risk management. Developing and implementing a timely and effective pandemic preparedness system for all countries could cost an estimated $3.4 billion annually, while the expected annual benefit is an estimated $37 billion, according to the World Bank. 
Systematic prevention efforts will both reduce the risks of pandemics and produce considerable economic and health benefits.
Indeed, with pandemics, as with many areas of health, prevention is less costly than cure. With an estimated annual expected rate of return of roughly 50-123%, and benefit-cost ratio of roughly 11:1 for severe pandemic prevention, according to the World Bank, fulfilling our duty to prevent Covid-19 as economically as possible -- had we done it -- might just have been one of the most straightforward decisions of the 21st century."

Narrator: A COVID-19 vaccine will take at least a year to get approved, which may sound like a long time, but it would actually be record-breaking. New vaccines usually take between 10 and 15 years to get to market, but a year still won't be fast enough to hold off any upcoming outbreaks. What potentially will are treatments. A treatment helps people who are already sick, while a vaccine prevents a disease in healthy people. And that's the main reason a vaccine is going to take so long. As of March 26, there were over 120 different developers pursuing three different approaches to curing COVID-19: repurposed drugs, new antibody treatments, and vaccines.
Maria Elena Bottazzi: Vaccines, unfortunately, since we know it's given to healthy people, you really have to be very careful what you give because, one, you want to make sure it's super safe, that you're not going to cause something bad by just giving the vaccine. More importantly is that when you then get the infection, that the vaccine is good to tackle the infection, but it's not going to make the reaction so severe.
Narrator: Vaccines are designed to trigger an immune response without actually causing an infection. By taking a weakened, inactive, or partial virus and introducing it to your system, it can start producing the right antibodies to fight it. Antibodies are created naturally by your body, but it takes time - weeks, sometimes months - to produce one just the right shape to fit, and therefore fight, a virus your body hasn't seen before. For some people facing the COVID-19 pandemic, that's too long to wait. The infection can spread rapidly in the lungs, causing lasting damage or even kill a person before the body produces enough antibodies. A vaccine allows your body to go through this process without the risk and sets it up with memory cells that will recognize the pathogen if it ever comes back, getting rid of it before you even know it's there. But vaccines have extra-long clinical trial phases because it can take weeks or months for a participant to develop immunity. Researchers then have to wait several more months to see if they get sick, since it would be unethical to expose them to the virus intentionally. And because vaccines are meant to prevent, it's more difficult to get one approved for compassionate use.
Bottazzi: Like when you're already so sick that you are gonna die, you'll try anything and everything, right? And so the FDA gives you permission to sometimes try nontraditional drugs because, you know, you're already pretty much, you know, almost dead, right?
Narrator: Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi leads a team at Baylor College of Medicine that's working on a COVID-19 vaccine. Two, in fact. They're using old research, a vaccine candidate from SARS-1 that they developed a decade ago. It's been frozen and constantly monitored ever since interest and funding ran out. The virus that causes SARS and the virus that causes COVID-19 share about 70% to 80% of their genetic makeup, making this vaccine a good jumping-off point. As it stands, the original vaccine could offer limited protection against COVID-19, but it could also accelerate the development of a more effective vaccine.
Bottazzi: It's a rapid switch strategy, where you start doing some studies with the current SARS. You build evidence of safety by bringing that molecule to the clinic fast. You may then stop there and not pursue it, meaning not pursue it for licensure, but by then we will have the other one, and you can rapidly bridge it in and switch it in. And then you continue the studies with the other one that is more specific.
Narrator: But even with this head start, their vaccine still won't be widely available for at least 12 months. After it's developed, the vaccine will move into safety and toxicity testing, followed by a clinical trial, then FDA approval. And this is the case for all 40-plus vaccines currently in development. It's unlikely any of them will be finished and approved in time to affect this pandemic, but they could stop future outbreaks. Even the leading front-runner for a vaccine, a candidate developed by Moderna that's already in human trials after unconventionally bypassing animal testing, is still looking at one year or longer for commercial release. It would be a rare example of a vaccine being approved for compassionate use, but it is worth noting that the company is looking into emergency use of the experimental vaccine, specifically for aid workers, by fall of this year. Besides taking too long, vaccines don't work as well in people who are elderly or immunocompromised, two groups that are at high risk of dying from COVID-19. Antibody treatments get around that. These treatments follow a similar path to vaccines to widespread use, but instead of setting your body up to make antibodies itself, this treatment injects premade antibodies into your system.
Sarah Ives: They can be administered to people who are infected, and they'll start clearing the virus, and they'll clear the infection within a matter of hours. They will actually help people recover faster as well as reduce the mortality rate.
Narrator: They can be used preventatively, but they don't last as long as vaccines do, so they're primarily used as treatments. But in this outbreak, medical professionals could benefit from a preventative antibody treatment.
Ives: So, antibodies usually take a while too, but we're doing something that is extremely rapid, and that's because we've already let nature do half of the work for us.
Narrator: Sarah Ives and other scientists at Distributed Bio are working on a monoclonal antibody based on one that is already able to neutralize a SARS infection.
Ives: Because these people have already created these antibodies in their bodies, and we are just taking those resources, because people have already studied them, already published their sequences, and we're cutting out months to years of the drug-development process.
Narrator: Once the team identifies the new antibodies that fit the COVID-19 virus the tightest, it still has to go through the same trials a vaccine does, but a shorter version. The team hopes to have a drug available for widespread use by early fall of this year. And they're just one of more than 20 developers hoping to create a successful antibody treatment. Finally, repurposed drugs could be available as early as April. Those are drugs that the FDA or another regulator has already approved to treat other diseases and that could work for COVID-19. Repurposed drugs don't need to go through as much testing as experimental ones, which makes a great case for compassionate use, and could already exist in large quantities. The World Health Organization has started global trials on the four treatments that look the most promising, three repurposed treatments alongside one experimental drug, but there's no guarantee that any will work. One of these treatments, a drug combo used to treat HIV, already failed in a small Chinese study. But the WHO believes a larger trial with potentially thousands of participants in dozens of countries is warranted. The study is unusual, forgoing the traditional double-blind method, which opens the study up to the possibility of placebo effects. But it also means they can move faster and get answers, and hopefully a cure, as soon as possible. As of March 24, the FDA had approved the use of convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment on a limited basis. It involves taking blood plasma from a person who's recovered from COVID-19, testing it for antibodies, and injecting the plasma or a derivative of it into someone who's sick. It's worked in the past, but not on every disease, so it's not certain if it will be safe or effective for COVID-19, which is why, outside of clinical trials, it's only being approved for use in patients with serious or life-threatening infections. Even if it is proven to work, convalescent plasma isn't scalable. The treatment requires large amounts of donated blood from recovered patients, and each donation can be given to only a handful of sick patients. So there's no way to manufacture or distribute it as widely as needed for a pandemic. These timelines are a best-case scenario, where nothing goes wrong. For both treatments and vaccines, there's the potential they won't be approved by the FDA for safety or efficacy reasons. And even if they do get through the approval stage, there's still the issue of making sure there's enough to go around.
Bottazzi: So, there's three layers of issues, right? So, there's the money issues, that you don't have enough, and, to be quite honest, never enough. Scalability and suitability, right? You know, so, the logistical piece of not only making it, but delivering it and distributing it. And, you know, how often do you make them? Where do you store them? Who's gonna buy them?
Ives: We are going to need significant financial and government support so that we can scale up these antibodies and manufacture them at a high enough capacity to be delivered to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
Narrator: Both treatments and vaccines are valuable and necessary for fighting COVID-19. But the bottom line is that we likely won't see any way to medically treat or prevent this disease for weeks. All of the developers are working on fairly parallel timelines, simultaneously trying to make long-term and short-term solutions available to the global public. And the rest of us can help by staying home.
Ives: Social distancing and self-quarantine are the only measures that we can take right now to mitigate the spread of this virus. But when we have a medicine, it will allow people to go back to work. And even if the virus does start to come back in waves, it will still reduce the burden on the healthcare system as well as our economy."

 (CNN)In the midst of the greatest health crisis in living memory, the doctor responsible for HELPING TO find a solution, a vaccine, says he was removed for challenging the nonsensical ideas of President Donald Trump about hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Rick Bright, head of the vaccine program, says he lost his job for demanding Trump's ideas be subjected to rigorous testing. Bright was dismissed as the director of the US Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and demoted to a role in the National Institutes of Health. 
In response to Bright's claim, Trump said that he ""never heard of him."" ""The guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. You'd have to hear the other side.""
Who will be held accountable for this and the mounting number of outrages that have prolonged the crisis and led to more deaths?
""What do you have to lose?"" Trump asked Americans during an April 4 news briefing, as he urged anxious viewers to take the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine -- which we now know could lead to more deaths -- for Covid-19. 
The answer, of course, is their lives. What do the people of Georgia have to lose, he may ask again, as he initially cheered on Gov. Brian Kemp, who is disregarding Trump's own guidelines and starting to reopen the state at the height of a pandemic.
In the face of alarm at Kemp's plan and at his support, Trump unexpectedly reversed course on Wednesday evening, announcing that he told the governor that he ""strongly"" disagreed with reopening certain facilities like spas, beauty shops and tattoo parlors. 
With that, he backtracked on one of his errors, perhaps hoping to avoid blame for yet another surge of Covid-19 patients.
Another grievous error would have added to the long series of presidential missteps along this road, mistakes for which neither Trump nor his acolytes and promoters, including Fox News -- which offers a megaphone for every manner of Trump outrage -- never apologize. 
Will the Trump administration be called to account for the extraordinarily serious accusations by Dr. Bright, who, in a statement, said he resisted pressure to pursue Trump's drug panacea and objected to ""rushing blindly towards unproven drugs"" which could be ""disastrous and result in countless more deaths.""
For weeks, Trump and Fox News hosts and guests incessantly repeated unproven claims about hydroxychloroquine. The country's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, tried valiantly to lower expectations. But Trump persisted. ""I really think they should take it,"" he advised, blocking Fauci from commenting. We all wished there were a quick, easy cure, but we also wanted a responsible leader.
""It's just a feeling,"" he explained as he promoted the drug from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters. I'm a ""smart guy."" Trump said he had ordered 28 million doses; he wrongly claimed the US Food and Drug Administration approving hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment. People rushed to buy it, creating shortages for those who needed it to treat diseases like lupus.
Now, a US Veterans Health Administration study found Covid-19 patients who took Trump's ""game changer"" drug were more likely to die than those who didn't. In the study, 27.8% of those who took it died, compared to 11.4% who did not. A study in France was stopped to prevent worse damage. The same happened with a Brazilian study.
The President doesn't talk about the drug anymore. Neither do personalities on Fox News, which banged the drum relentlessly, with its quackery-prone doctors promoting it on multiple shows, exciting the Fox-loving Trump, who reportedly met at the White House with Fox's Laura Ingraham and two of her TV show's regular guests to discuss the promise of hydroxychloroquine, according to the Washington Post. 
The time he and the network wasted promoting the drug could have been used guiding the public on ways to protect themselves, on ways to protect the community, to protect all of us.
Trump and everyone else who magnifies the President's most irresponsible exhortations bears guilt in this disaster.
Back when the pandemic was already spreading and Trump kept saying it was all under control, disparaging calls for urgent action as a ""hoax"" against him by Democrats and the media, his favorite propagandists on Fox kept telling the same lies. Notorious among them was Sean Hannity, though he said earlier this month in an interview that he never called it a ""hoax."" 
Hannity, of course, was echoing Trump downplaying of the virus. Survey after survey found that Republicans from the beginning were less concerned about the virus. 
One hesitates to blame individuals -- politicians or celebrities -- for the killings executed by a virus. But the inescapable fact is that the message from Trump, Hannity and others in right-wing media made it easier for the virus to carry out its deadly mission.
Will anyone be held responsible for the egregious misinformation?
One might think this is an ethical question better left for the future, one we should discuss when the carnage has ended. But that would be a mistake because Trump and his helpers are continuing to splash gasoline on the raging fire.
Before Gov. Kemp announced that by the end of this week people can start getting their nails done and getting a tattoo, perhaps he should have spent a few hours at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, Georgia, where, as the Los Angeles Times reported, the staff was ""struggling to treat a community afflicted with one of the most intense coronavirus rates in the nation."" 
Many in Georgia are furious at the governor; mayors are scrambling to figure out how to protect residents from a dangerous order that bars cities from imposing restrictions. 
And while the President has backtracked in his support of the governor's move, it's clear that Kemp and other governors are following Trump's lead in accelerating the reopening before scientists think it's safe. 
Trump, too, should show us how convinced he is about the need to ""liberate"" states from stay-at-home orders by spending some time in a hospital swamped with Covid-19 patients. 
The Georgia order, which would also reopen movie theatres by Monday, comes before the state meets the official White House conditions for beginning to reopen: 14 days of decreasing cases, ""robust"" testing for antibodies and the coronavirus among health care workers. None of that has happened.
Now, Trump has reversed his position on Georgia but not before first expressing support for Kemp's decisions and sending a strong message to his supporters that he favors an accelerated reopening of the economy. He's sending mixed messages at a most dangerous time. 
Georgia is nowhere near ready to open. The scientific model the White House has been using says stay-at-home orders should remain in place in Georgia until at least June. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield is warning that a second wave of the virus could hit even harder next winter, when the seasonal flu is also expected.
Trump's actions and words could all but ensure that that's precisely what happens. And his accomplices at Fox News will magnify the harmful impact of wrongheaded decisions. We will all pay the price, and they will never apologize. They will never admit they got any of it wrong. It will be left to the American people to reach a verdict -- and proceed accordingly."

As of March 28, US states and territories had reported 122,653 coronavirus cases, the report said. For the 7,162 cases in which patients' underlying health data were available, the CDC said 71% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 78% of those admitted to intensive care units had preexisting conditions or risk factors. By contrast, just 27% of people who tested positive but weren't hospitalized had underlying health issues.
The most frequently reported preexisting conditions among US coronavirus patients were diabetes, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.
Here's how different health conditions correlate with hospitalization and ICU admissions among US coronavirus cases.
Business Insider/Skye Gould, data from CDC
The CDC noted that many of the conditions reported by patients are fairly common among Americans in general.
The agency also cautioned that its findings are still preliminary and that the analysis was constrained by factors like missing health data for nearly 95% of patients, as well as the limited availability of coronavirus testing, and a lack of information about longer-term outcomes of the disease.
Still, the early findings are comparable to those from countries like China and Italy, which have both seen higher rates of death and severe cases among patients with preexisting health conditions.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that death rates among patients with heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and cancer were significantly higher than the nationwide average, while Italy's National Institute of Health found that 99% of people who died from COVID-19 had at least one preexisting condition.
""Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions, including social distancing and handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19,"" the CDC report said.
The agency recommends that anyone with an underlying health condition who experiences symptoms of COVID-19 — which often include fever, cough, and shortness of breath — should immediately contact a healthcare provider.

11,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",STAN CHOE / AP,Stock Market Sinks 2.9 Percent After Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate,Stocks fell sharply Tuesday after an emergency interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to reassure markets about COVID-19.,https://time.com/5795105/stock-market-coronavirus-updates/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-stocks.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-03-03T21:59:18Z,"(NEW YORK) — Fear and uncertainty continue to control Wall Street, and stocks fell sharply Tuesday after an emergency interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to reassure markets wracked by worries that a fast-spreading virus will cause a recession.
The Dow Jones Industrial average sank 785 points, or 2.9%. It had surged 5% a day earlier on hopes for a broader set of stimulus measures.
While the cut gave some investors exactly what they had been asking for, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that the ultimate solution to the virus challenge will have to come from health experts and others, not central banks. Some traders are also questioning whether more aid is on the way to stabilize the market, while others called the Fed’s move premature to begin with. For more than a few, the Fed’s steepest rate cut since 2008 recalled the dark days of the financial crisis and only added to the dread.
Through it all, markets are still faced with the same quandary that has sent stock prices tumbling 11% since they set a record just two weeks ago: No one knows how far the virus will ultimately spread before authorities can get it under control, and by how much companies’ profits will be shorn because of it.
That uncertainty led to jagged trading across markets on Tuesday. Stocks rallied briefly in the morning following the Fed’s surprise move, but it took just 15 minutes for the gains to evaporate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell below 1% for the first time in history as investors ratcheted back expectations for the economy and inflation. A gauge measuring traders’ fear of upcoming swings for stocks jerked wildly up and down through the day.
After popping to a 1.5% gain shortly after the Fed’s announcement, the S&amp;P 500 swung between modest gains and losses for about an hour before turning decisively lower. The index ended the day down 86.86 points, or 2.8%, at 3,003.37. It pared a loss that reached 3.7% in the mid-afternoon, and it marks the eighth drop in the last nine days for the index.
The Fed has a long history of coming to the market’s rescue with lower rates and other stimulus, which has helped this bull market in U.S. stocks become the longest on record. Some analysts said the Fed’s latest cut could provide some more confidence.
“Confidence in markets is crucial,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Without confidence, you don’t have a market.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had jumped Monday to its best day in more than a decade on rising anticipation for aid from the Fed and other central banks. Even before Tuesday’s announcement, traders were convinced that the Fed would cut rates by half a percentage point on March 18 at its next meeting.
But doubts are high about whether the medicine provided by central banks can be as effective this time around. Lower rates can encourage shoppers and businesses to borrow and spend more, but they can’t reopen factories that have been shut or recall workers out due to quarantines.
After the Fed’s announcement, Powell acknowledged that central banks can’t solve the health crisis. But he said the Fed recognizes the fast spread of the virus is a risk for the economy, and he cited concerns from the travel and hotel industries. Powell said that since last week, when several Fed officials had said they saw no urgent need to cut rates, “we have seen a broader spread of the virus.”
The high stakes pushed the Fed to cut rates outside of a regularly scheduled meeting for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, when investors were considering a complete meltdown of the world’s financial system as possible if not likely. That in itself may have spooked the market, as some investors wondered if the Fed saw things as worse than they were led to believe.
“I don’t believe that market participants woke up this morning thinking we were facing a crisis similar to the global financial crisis,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “But that’s what the Fed’s actions suggested to some.”
She said investors will likely have mixed emotions about the move for days.
Some economists called the Fed’s move premature, given that U.S. economic data has yet to show a sharp drop due to the virus.
“The nature of today’s announcement could send the wrong signal to market participants, including individual investors who are concerned with recent market volatility,” said Roger Aliaga-Diaz, chief economist of the Americas at Vanguard.
Markets are likely to remain shaky until investors get a sense of what the worst-case scenario really is in this virus outbreak. Markets have been on edge for nearly two weeks, as the virus spreads beyond China and companies across continents and industries say they expect it to hit their profits.
Payments processor Visa on Tuesday joined the lengthening list of companies warning investors. It said its quarterly revenue will be weaker than earlier predicted because of a drop-off in travel-related spending on cards.
“To get a floor on the markets, realistically, what we need to see is not so much a cut in the number of new coronavirus cases, but at least a slowdown in the acceleration,” said Salvatore Bruno, chief investment officer for IndexIQ. “Up until that time, we’re likely to see a lot of volatility.”
Worldwide, more than 92,000 people have been sickened, and over 3,100 have died. The number of countries hit by the virus has reached at least 70, with Ukraine and Morocco reporting their first cases.
The topsy-turvy Tuesday got off to a slow trading start in the United States. Earlier in the day, the Group of Seven major industrialized countries pledged support for the global economy, but they stopped short of announcing any specific new measures. Disappointment in the lack of action helped push U.S. stocks lower at the opening of trading, before the Fed surprised markets with its announcement of the steep, half-point rate cut at 10 a.m. Eastern time.
Investors are still speculating whether other central banks will join and cut rates and offer stimulus in a coordinated effort around the world. Before the Fed made its move, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its key interest rate to a record low 0.5%.
U.S. markets have been hit hard by fear over the virus’ impact. Monday’s surge for stocks on hopes that central banks will come to the rescue followed a broad sell-off last week that erased gains for 2020 and sent indexes into what market watchers call a “correction,” or a fall of 10% or more from a peak. Last week was the worst for the S&amp;P 500 since the financial crisis.
MARKET ROUNDUP:
The S&amp;P 500 fell 86.86 points, or 2.8%, at 3,003.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 785.91 points, or 2.9%, to 25,917.41, and the Nasdaq fell 268.07, or 3%, to 8,684.09.
European stock markets were broadly higher, with the German DAX returning 1.1%, the French CAC 40 up 1.1% and the FTSE 100 up 1%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.2%, South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6%, and stocks in Shanghai added 0.7%.
Bond yields swung following the Fed’s announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slumped to 1.01% from 1.08% late Monday after earlier dropping below the 1% threshold for the first time. The 10-year yield tends to fall when expectations are for weak economic growth and inflation. Shorter-term yields, which move more on Fed actions, had even more dramatic drops. The two-year Treasury yield sank to 0.71% from 0.81%.

The CDC confirmed that a person being treated for COVID-19 was released from a federally mandated quarantine as a result of a positive COVID-19 test, according to a Sunday press release from the City of San Antonio. The CDC had said it is retesting an individual who was released from isolation at a local healthcare facility on Friday “because the individual met the criteria for release, including two negative test results” but was isolated again “after a pending, subsequent lab test came up positive for the virus that causes COVID-19”, according to the city’s statement.
Local officials said at a press conference on Monday that the person is now isolated again after being “out in the community for slightly over 12 hours” and urged state and federal officials not to release the remaining evacuees quarantined at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland until they were tested a third time for the new coronavirus. On Monday afternoon, Nirenberg declared a public health emergency “explicitly designed to ensure” that the more than 120 evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship remain at the military base until further testing is completed. They were originally set to be released from quarantine on Monday.
“As mayor of this city I find it totally unacceptable that the CDC would release a patient prior to receiving all test results and potentially exposing the public to this harm,” Nirenberg said during Monday’s press conference. “Local health professionals, in whom I have the utmost confidence, are working very hard to prevent the spread of this virus here in San Antonio and we simply, we cannot have a screw up like this from our federal partners.”
The CDC emphasized that the patient had no symptoms at the time of their release, and met all of the agency’s criteria for release: the lack of any symptoms and two consecutive sets of negative test results, collected more than 24 hours apart. Dawn Emerick, director of San Antonio’s Metropolitan Health District, said at the press conference that local officials are in “constant contact” with the state and CDC about identifying what protocols can be updated, specifically about expanding current protocol to require two consecutive negative tests to three.
The CDC said the patient was isolated again at a local medical facility “out of an abundance of caution” and that the agency, in partnership with local public health partners, was following up to contact people who may have been exposed to the infected person. It noted that “others have encountered similar situations where test results have alternated back and forth between negative and positive” and that the cycle of infection “on this particular patient is longer than what has been previously seen.”
According to a timeline shared by the city, the patient was dropped off at the Holiday Inn Express Airport around 3 p.m. on Feb. 29. Just after 5 p.m. the patient took a hotel shuttle to visit North Star Mall, where they visited a few stores and went to the food court, ordered food from a Chinese restaurant and ate alone in the food court. They returned to the hotel on the hotel shuttle at 7:30 p.m and on Sunday at 2:00 a.m. they were transported back to the Texas Center for Infectious Disease in a specialized ambulance.
The document said that, to date, 10 people evacuated to Lackland “have tested positive for the virus and it is anticipated that the number of persons diagnosed with the virus is likely to increase.” There were two main groups of evacuees at the base: the first group includes 91 Americans evacuated from Wuhan who were released from quarantine on Feb. 20 and the second group includes 144 passengers evacuated from a cruise ship docked in Japan, according to the document.
Nirenberg had tweeted on Sunday that the CDC’s actions were “unacceptable.”
Texans in Congress were quick to speak out, as well.
U.S. House Rep. Joaquin Castro tweeted Monday that he would ask Congress to “investigate CDC’s protocols for the treatment of coronavirus patients.”
U.S. Sen. José Menéndez tweeted that he is calling on leadership in Texas to make the CDC bring COVID-19 test kits to Bexar County, “where they have caused unnecessary exposure.”

Why has the US only performed a few hundred?,https://time.com/5793605/coronavirus-testing-united-states/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1206791434.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-03-03T15:16:55Z,"After a slow and criticized rollout of U.S. government-designed testing kits for the novel coronavirus COVID-19, federal agencies enforced new policies to scale up capacity to conduct tests and produce results more quickly.
On Feb. 29, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) policy to allow more labs to apply for approval to conduct testing for COVID-19. Until the announcement, two labs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were the only ones in the country that could test for the disease.
Expanding the number of labs that can perform COVID-19 testing is critical to getting a more accurate sense of how widespread the virus may be in the country. Some public health experts warn that the current number of cases in the US may be low simply because too few people have been tested; with more testing, the count in the country will likely rise. Already, the number of confirmed cases has increased from 62 on Feb. 28 to 101 on March 2.
Government agencies can activate Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) review processes during extenuating circumstances such as an emerging disease outbreak. In this particular case, the EUA enables the CDC to use the test, which picks up genetic signatures of the coronavirus, even before the FDA finished reviewing data on the test’s efficacy—a process that normally takes months.
As of this past weekend, that EUA is also granted to other labs in the country that meet certain proficiency criteria, and have the ability to develop and order the materials needed to perform their own test, or use the CDC template.
The CDC still plans to ship its own kits first to the 500 or so state and local health labs. However, each lab will get only one kit, which can perform about 800 tests. “That still keeps testing in the hundreds per state, which is really, really low,” says Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and medical director of the viral diagnostics lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. If other labs start developing their own tests, that number could increase rapidly.
Exactly how quickly more tests will become available isn’t clear. “The estimates that we’re getting from industry right now, by the end of this week close to one million tests will be able to be performed,” Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at a White House press conference Monday evening. Experts outside the Trump administration, however, say that’s not likely. Speaking to CBS News on Sunday, former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said that, at best, testing capacity would likely reach 10,000 people by the end of this week, and 20,000 within two weeks.
There are several reasons why testing isn’t so widespread in the US yet. Because infection rates to this point have remained low, CDC criteria for who should be tested are relatively narrow. The agency recommends that doctors not test everyone with symptoms of fever, coughing and difficult breathing, but only if they have these symptoms as well as a history of traveling to an area where cases are endemic, or being in close contact with someone who is diagnosed as positive. Those criteria remain in place.
Another challenge in rolling out testing has to do with the test itself. As soon as Chinese scientists published the genetic sequence of the COVID-19 virus in mid January, scientists around the world, including those at the CDC, went to work developing a diagnostic test to pick up the genetic footprint of the virus in infected people. Researchers at the World Health Organization zeroed in on a set of three genetic components of the proteins that stud the virus like a crown (or “corona,” which gives this class of viruses its name), and developed a test targeting these sections. Many countries adopted that test.
In the U.S., however, CDC researchers developed their own test, focusing on three different viral genes and their components. It got off to a bumpy start. State laboratories that received the first few kits reported back that the test wasn’t reliable, producing inconsistent results even when repeated on the same samples.
“The kits that were sent to us have demonstrated performance issues and cannot be relied upon to provide an accurate result,” says Stephanie Buhle, deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
The issue turned out to be one of the three targeted viral genes. CDC researchers determined that running the test using just two of the genetic components was as valid as using all three, and the FDA agreed. On Feb. 28, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, said new test kits including just the two components were ready for state and local health departments.
Not all experts are confident the new version will be considerably more reliable. Three genetic targets, they say, improve the chances of a reliable result. “By taking away one of the components, you run the risk of having a greater number of false positives,” says Mina.
The test, however, met FDA criteria for sensitivity; CDC officials did not respond to repeated requests for clarification.
Lab directors like Mina hope that having more labs developing tests will improve its accuracy. He believes that federal health authorities should consider making it standard policy for the FDA to expand the network of eligible labs that can apply for EUA status during an outbreak. That way, the national capacity for lab testing could scale up more rapidly.
There’s another potential benefit in having more labs develop their own versions of the test: it could lead to a more accurate tool. “Most microbiology lab testing is like a microwave dinner,” says Mina. “It comes as one kit, you push the button and you get your result. Nobody can screw it up. The CDC test kit for COVID-19 is more like Blue Apron. It comes with a box of ingredients that you can go to any store and buy, but it’s nicely packaged up for you, and comes with a recipe.”
Using the same recipe, but with chemicals ordered from different companies, could lead to slightly different versions of the test. As researchers figure out which formulas work best, they could uncover more accurate ones.

“I bet everyone’s like, ‘I’ve got coronavirus, I’m dying,’ and you’re like, ‘No, you’ve just got a cough,'” the Duke of Cambridge quipped to first responder Joe Mooney, according to video footage of their exchange. He added: “It does seem quite dramatic about coronavirus at the moment. Is it being a little hyped up, do you think, by the media?”
It’s not clear what Mooney said in response. More than 92,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in over 100 countries and at least 3,085 people have died from the infection. The United Kingdom has at least 51 reported cases of coronavirus, according to the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care — one British citizen, a male passenger who had been onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, died in hospital in Japan in February. Ireland, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visiting, has so far seen one case.

Coronavirus could potentially “spread extensively,” in the U.K., and it is “more likely than not that the U.K. will be significantly affected,” the Department wrote in its action plan for dealing with the disease.
Prince William’s quips continued during the event. In another video clip, he was heard saying, “By the way, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are spreading coronavirus. Sorry!”
His comments came the same day his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, was seen wearing gloves during an investiture ceremony in what was widely interpreted as a precaution against coronavirus.
The Duke of Cambridge was criticized online for joking about the outbreak, with a #crownavirus hashtag trending. “Just the future king joking about a virus that has killed thousands. Nothing to see here,” wrote one Twitter user.

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the NBA and NHL seasons into limbo, MLB’s opening day came and went with nary a knuckleball or bat flip, and the Olympics are being put off until 2021.
But one form of sporting event lives on in the age of social distancing: Esports, or competitive video gaming, is on the rise, with people tuning in to everything from Counter-Strike to League of Legends. Viewership on Twitch, the go-to site for game streamers, is up 31% in March, by one estimate. People stuck inside are playing more video games, no doubt. But they’re also watching the world’s best gamers take one another on, too.
“Sports are out and something needs to fill that void,” says Chance “Maux” Moncivaez, who plays Call of Duty: Modern Warfare player on the Florida Mutineers, an esports team. “I think esports is perfect to fill that void because of the ability to play online competitions.”
It’s not that the coronavirus outbreak has totally spared the esports world. The biggest, most well-funded competitions, like Activision-Blizzard’s Overwatch League, are held in-person in massive arenas like Madison Square Garden, often before sellout crowds. With big gatherings off the table, those events have been canceled, disrupting a business that counts in part on ticket and merch sales. But unlike basketball or hockey, it’s possible to shift esports back online, where they began — it just takes a little doing.
 “It is possible to train, and compete, and continue competition and create entertainment,” says Steve Arhancet, owner of Team Liquid, an esports organization that represents 70 players across 17 different games. “It’s all possible. But it’s not like the flip of a switch.”
One issue, says Arhancet, is making sure that players don’t cheat when they’re not under the watchful eye of a referee. “Aimbots,” or software that automatically aims at enemy players in shooter games, are one popular trick — think of them as the esports’ world sign-stealing controversy. Then there’s the simple issue of making sure every player has a good enough Internet connection to compete on equal footing; the tiniest bit of lag can result in a missed shot or miscast spell.
“We can get there,” says Arhancet. “We can do these things. We will be more resilient than a lot of professional sports industries. But how long will it take? Each game will handle that a little bit differently.”
Indeed, some leagues are finding their footing more quickly than others. While the Overwatch League has started back up, the competitive scene for Apex Legends has faltered. Riot Games — which developed, published, and organizes tournaments for esports giant League of Legends — took its League of Legends Championship Series [LCS] online-only in under a week.
“This is a time where our fans need something to watch, need something to entertain them, need something to distract them from the things that are going on around them, even if it’s just for a short time,” says LCS Commissioner Christopher Greeley. “With the complete absence of conventional sports, and only a handful of esports able to deliver remotely, it was important for us to deliver for the fans.”
Being able to operate amid a total absence of “conventional” sports would seem like a brilliant marketing opportunity for the esports world, which is closer than ever to going truly mainstream. But people in the business say that for now, they’re more focused on keeping their existing audience engaged rather than trying to pull in new fans.
“I think the opportunity certainly exists, but it’s not the opportunity we’re focused on,” says Greeley. “If the ancillary effect of that is people who normally would be watching the NCAA tournament are flipping on Twitch and finding the LCS and sticking around, that’s great. But it’s certainly not what we’re driving towards.” 
Still, as some desperate hoops fans turn to simulated matchups in basketball video games like NBA 2K, it doesn’t seem like a huge leap to convert them into lifelong esports viewers. But some are skeptical that those fans would stick around when traditional sports finally tip-off once again.
“The reality is that I don’t think there would be a turnover in the long term,” says Carlos Rodríguez Santiago, owner of European esports organization G2. “Our best bet is to keep doing what we’re doing … and embrace everybody that comes in and wants to learn about games.”
Newbies are tuning in regardless. Arhancet says Team Liquid’s viewership is up 30% higher than “any month we’ve had in company history,” while Santaigo says viewership numbers for G2 are up around 20 percent. Twitch itself went from 33 million to 43 million viewers between March 8 and March 22. 
But the players and organizers who spoke with TIME for this story seemed aware of why the numbers are up, and many simply want the virus to go away.
“I think time will tell how resilient the esports industry will be,” says Arhancet. “Honestly, I’m really hopeful that in four weeks, there’s been enough social distancing and preventive measures to curb this, and we’re back to normal before we know it.”

“The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice,” a statement read. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”
Previously, it had been floated that the NBA might continue to play games, only without fans. The goal of this being to limit large gatherings, which could increase the spread of the virus. Los Angeles Lakers star Lebron James said last week that he wouldn’t play if games were held without fans.

For the next 18 minutes, the Democrats’ leading contender for the presidency offered Americans a dress rehearsal for the job he hopes to have come January. Reading from prepared remarks about how to combat the global coronavirus pandemic, he sought to reassure the public, markets and allies that the United States will prevail—all while appearing undeniably presidential. After the speech, #PresidentBiden was trending on Twitter.
About an hour and a half later, Bernie Sanders, who significantly trails Biden for the Democratic nomination, struck a similar tone. In the face of a global pandemic, he said, Americans must act not for themselves, but in the service of others. “Now is the time for solidarity. Now is the time to come together with love and compassion for all.” 
The two Democratic rivals’ speeches diverged from one another’s. Biden emphasized competence and experience, while Sanders repeatedly called for solidarity. But both made a point of differentiating themselves most markedly from the actual President. 
In planned remarks from the Oval Office on March 11, President Donald Trump bungled his message, declared the U.S. in a unilateral fight against a “foreign virus,” and accidentally announced a ban on all travel and trade with Europe. (The White House later clarified it was only travel of non-Americans and that trade between the U.S. and Europe would continue.)
Where Trump characterized the fight against COVID-19 as one in which the U.S. faced off against the world, both Biden and Sanders described the stakes as one in which humans were allied with one another: the virus must be wrestled to containment through international cooperation. “The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,” Biden said, standing in front of a backdrop of five U.S. flags at the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Delaware. 
“If there ever was a time in the modern history of our country when we are all in this together, this is that moment,” Sanders said, before a wall plastered with his campaign logo, an American flag and a Vermont flag in Burlington, Vermont. 
Both Biden and Sanders unleashed withering criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis so far. “Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” Biden said. “Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.”
“We have an administration that is largely incompetent, and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country,” Sanders said. 
Both men also offered voters a glimpse of their own coronavirus response plans—blueprints for what they would do if they were President. Biden’s proposal underscored his own deep experience in the White House. He reminded Americans of his front row seats during the Ebola crisis, when his former chief of staff and current adviser Ron Klain led the Obama administration’s response. He then offered a litany of solutions, which were drafted with input from a host of leading experts, including Klain, bioethicist Zeke Emanuel and former White House homeland security chief Lisa Monaco: free and accessible testing, lower barriers for lab trials on a vaccine, economic relief for those affected and added hospital capacity, including temporary sites. Among his other recommendations were a call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to set clear standards for when to close schools and other high-traffic sites.
Sanders’s plan was a reflection of his campaign that focused on folding marginalized people into politics. The appropriate response, he said, would include declaring a national emergency, making access to testing and eventual treatment or vaccine free of charge and pushing for national and state hotlines to respond to queries with accurate information. He would advocate for paid family and medical leave, call for a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs during this outbreak, and demand that workers in the gig economy be allowed to file for unemployment.
“The coronavirus is already causing a global economic meltdown which is impacting people throughout the world and in our own country,” Sanders said. “And it is especially dangerous for low income and working class families, people who today, before the crisis, are struggling economically.”
While both Biden and Sanders struck notes of empathy for the American people, their campaigns were also operating from places of deep uncertainty. As the threat became more acutely apparent, each scaled back large-format campaigning and told staffers to work from home.
While Biden has emerged in recent days as the clear front-runner, his campaign remains a work in progress. On Thursday, he installed the third top aide with final say he’s had in a year. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, a 43-year-old political pro, is set to become the new manager in the campaign’s Philadelphia headquarters. O’Malley Dillon is a no-nonsense taskmaster whose operations are precise, and the campaign is hoping she’ll bring that discipline to a campaign that has often felt like it was ambling.
Meanwhile, Sanders’s campaign, facing increasingly unlikely prospects for the Democratic nomination, remained solidly on-message: good leadership must reflect the needs of all people living within U.S. borders. In his speech Thursday, Sanders underscored that the country is at a disadvantage because it does not guarantee health care for all. The number of uninsured or underinsured people are inherently a liability to the country in controlling coronavirus because they cannot afford to seek the appropriate medical attention.
For both candidates, the coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to showcase their leadership styles—if primarily as an alternative to Trump.

Given the slow roll out of testing for COVID-19 in the U.S., and concerns about spreading the disease, at-home testing could help to diagnose more cases. After initially limiting testing to one provided by the Centers for Disease Control and conducted at state and local public health labs, the Food and Drug Administration allowed certified labs, including commercial lab testing companies, to develop and distribute COVID-19 tests on Feb. 29. Though other private companies have been involved with creating tests for COVID-19, this is the first company to offer its test directly to consumers.
The Austin-based Everlywell offers a range of validated tests for everything from cholesterol levels to fertility and infectious diseases like STDs.
People can order the Everlywell COVID-19 test on the company’s website, after first answering questions about their basic health, symptoms and risk factors for the coronavirus disease. A doctor still needs to prescribe the test, so telemedicine doctors from PWNHealth, a national network of physicians who prescribe diagnostic tests, then reviews these answers to determine if a person qualifies for testing, based on criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, because COVID-19 tests are not plentiful in the U.S., doctors are trying to rule out other respiratory diseases like flu first, and only ordering tests for people with symptoms who also have other risk factors for infection, such as being in close contact with others who have been diagnosed.
If the telemedicine doctor decides to prescribe an Everlywell COVID-19 test, the company says it will send the $135 test kit in two days (customers can pay $30 more to receive the kit overnight). The kit comes with a special swab that is long enough to take samples from the back of the nose and throat area, along with instructions for how to seal the swab sample to send it back to the company. People can also provide both spit and sputum samples as backups. (For now, the Food and Drug Administration only validates samples from nasoparyngeal swabs, but companies have applied to test spit and sputum.).
The sample is sent in a pre-paid overnight package, and processed at one of several labs approved by the FDA to perform the test around the country within 72 hours. As with many of the commercially available tests, this one extracts SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, from the sample and then probes for specific genetic signatures of the virus.
The company says it will then send results by text and email, and doctors may advise people to self-isolate until they receive them. If the test is positive, the company also provides a full telemedicine consultation with one of around 200 physicians that is included in the cost of the test. That physician also reports the result as a positive case to the appropriate state health departments, as is required by health authorities.
Everlywell says it is ready to ship 30,000 COVID-19 tests, and plans to expand the number of labs processing the samples. But CEO and founder Julia Cheek says that scaling up the number of testing kits will depend on the availability of swabs for collecting samples. Three major manufacturers make the swabs, but the main producer, it turns out, is a company based in Italy. Because the country is under lockdown, limited supplies from there, as well as the surge in demand as more COVID-19 testing is conducted around the world, are leading to a global shortage of swabs for any lab performing the test. That’s why Everlywell’s first kits will contain only one swab, and Everlywell will limit kits to one per household until the supply of swabs becomes more plentiful.
“We’re working hard to ramp up weekly capacity to test 250,000 Americans,” says Cheek. “Our goal is to continue to refresh capacity but with the global swab shortage we don’t have a confirmed timeline for that yet. Ultimately, she says, the testing kits could be designed for a household so everyone in a family could be tested if needed to know what protective measure they might need to take.

The company today revealed an interactive map that tracks where people are experiencing symptoms from the novel coronavirus throughout the US, based on data from an ongoing survey the company is running with Carnegie Mellon. The map is granular enough to let you see an estimated percentage of people with COVID-19 symptoms down to the county level
To reiterate, the map shows an estimated percentage of people experiencing self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, not confirmed cases. Still, Facebook hopes the aggregate data could be useful for guidance regarding the virus. As Zuckerberg puts it:
Understanding how Covid-19 is spreading is critical for local governments and public health officials as they allocate scarce resources like ventilators and PPE, and eventually to decide when it is safe to start re-opening different places. Researchers believe these symptom survey maps can be an important tool in making these decisions.
The company says the survey currently includes a sample of users over 18 years of age within the US, but company plans on going global this week, according to Mark Zuckerberg.
Considering its likely many more people have been infected than tested, and given Facebook has over 2 billion monthly users around the globe, the data could prove insightful. And to assuage privacy concerns, the company says only Carnegie Mellon researchers can see individual survey responses Facebook only sees the aggregate information.
You can try out the interactive map here. It can be divided by either counties or hospital referral regions. Facebook says it plans to update the map with new cases information daily.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions for brick and mortar businesses and e-commerce brands alike. While much of the media focus has been on forced closures of retail locations, I’ve also seen plenty of online stores that have been adversely affected by these changes.
With supply chain interruptions and adapting to remote teams, even e-commerce brands are undergoing a period of significant adjustments. While we are better positioned for these changes than others, it is still a challenging time. Visual Capitalist data reveals that while many food staples are experiencing sales increases of over 300 percent, many “non-essential” categories — particularly luggage, cameras and swimwear — have experienced sharp declines.
Unfortunately, the shift to online purchasing isn’t just hurting select businesses. It is also causing many individuals with disabilities to get left behind due to a lack of web accessibility.
I’ve written about the importance of web accessibility before, but now that we’re in a time when many people are limited to shopping exclusively online, it is more essential than ever.
What COVID-19 means for web accessibility
According to the CDC, roughly one in four adults in the United States live with some type of disability. That’s roughly 61 million people. These numbers include people with mobility limitations, hearing and vision disabilities, as well as issues related to cognitive function.
All of these disabilities can impact someone’s ability to use the internet. Someone who is blind will depend on a screen reader to navigate a website. Deaf individuals rely on closed captioning or transcripts for audiovisual content. If a website doesn’t have provisions to address these and other access needs, the website can become essentially unusable.
While the Americans with Disabilities Act ensures that accommodations are made to meet access needs at physical retail locations, e-commerce brands have lagged behind in ensuring similar accessibility provisions are made for their stores.
When physical retail is unavailable, this can quickly become problematic. Quartz reports that year over year retail foot traffic dropped 97.6 percent in March, in large part because of retailers closing to slow the spread. For many, especially those with compromised immune systems or other underlying health conditions, buying online is now the only viable shopping option.
Where online stores are falling short with web accessibility
While e-commerce could seem more convenient for individuals with disabilities, most websites fail to address even basic access requirements to ensure users can get information or make a purchase.
Web accessibility automation platform accessiBe recently evaluated 10,000,000 websites to see if they met WCAG accessibility standards. Of this large sample group, 98 percent had noncompliant menus. 89 percent had popups that interfered with basic access needs. The majority of sites also had accessibility issues with forms, icons, buttons and images.
Even a seemingly minor issue could keep an individual with disabilities from being able to complete a purchase. For example, if on-site buttons do not allow for keyboard navigation, a shopper might be unable to add a needed item to their shopping cart.
During the current pandemic, such obstacles could keep people from being able to purchase essential items they need when it is too dangerous for them to leave the house. In some cases, this could cause individuals in high-risk groups to run out of food or medication.
Potential fallout from not making your e-commerce store accessible
With such dire consequences associated with COVID-19, it is clear that we as e-commerce retailers have a responsibility to ensure that everyone can complete the purchases they want or need at this time. Failure to enhance website accessibility leaves an already-vulnerable group in an even more difficult situation.
If you don’t act, this could also lead to serious consequences for your e-commerce brand. The 2019 Click-Away Pound Study found that 69 percent of people with disabilities will abandon a site that presents access barriers — resulting in yearly losses of £17.1 billion in the UK alone.
In fact, 83 percent of those surveyed said they try to “limit their shopping to sites they know are barrier-free.” If your website has accessibility barriers, you could be losing money and not even be aware of it. This is a major missed opportunity, especially for e-commerce stores selling items that are currently in high demand.
The stress and anger many are feeling because of COVID-19 also presents another risk for noncompliant e-commerce sites: lawsuits. An analysis from Seyfarth found that 11,053 web accessibility related lawsuits were filed in the United States in 2019 — an eight percent increase over 2018, and a substantial increase from when just 2,722 lawsuits were filed in 2013.
Courts in the United States are increasingly viewing web accessibility as an ADA issue. E-commerce brands that fail to take quick action could find themselves facing serious consequences as frustrated customers attempt to deal with their situation.
Make accessibility a priority now
There is no telling how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to disrupt our daily lives. However, its impact will likely extend after the virus is no longer a major threat, altering our behaviors and buying habits for some time to come.
Because of this, online stores need to start prioritizing web accessibility today. This will allow you to better serve customers with access needs during the current crisis and when things eventually get back to normal."

 Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) April 9, 2020
President Trump recently started sharing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation that people should wear cloth face masks when out in public, but he's made it very clear that he will not be wearing a mask.
In an April news conference, Trump was asked why he won't wear a mask despite the fact that it would likely set a strong example for the country. He replied, ""I just don't choose to. They are not mandatory guidelines, they are guidelines. They suggest you could wear them, you don't have to wear them."" 
Trump further elaborated on his decision and said, "" ""Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens I just don't see it.""
While Melania's PSA was a step in the right direction in terms of raising awareness on the importance of wearing a mask, she truly did the bare minimum here. She spends the entirety of the video holding the mask never wearing it. But if she and the president don't practice what she's preaching how can she expect people to take her words seriously?
Perhaps in the next White House PSA she and the president will consider putting masks on themselves, or at least sharing some tips on how to make your own cloth masks, since many masks are sold out or reserved for medical professionals directly exposed to COVID-19."

This might be a worrying fact for many people, especially those who have only heard of one coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the disease known as COVID-19.
There is much more to coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are actually a family of hundreds of viruses. Most of these infected animals such as bats, chickens, camels, and cats. Occasionally, viruses that infect one species can mutate in such a way that allows them to start infecting another species. This is called cross-species transmission or spillover.
The first coronavirus was discovered in chickens in the 1930s. It was a few decades until the first human coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s. To date, seven coronaviruses have the ability to cause disease in humans. Four are endemic (regularly found among particular people or in a certain area) and usually cause mild disease, but three can cause much more serious and even fatal disease.
The first coronavirus discovered was in chickens. Pieter/Shutterstock
Common cold
Coronaviruses can be found all over the world and are responsible for about 10-15% of common colds, mostly during the winter. The coronaviruses that cause mild to moderate disease in humans are called: 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1.
The first coronaviruses discovered that are able to infect humans are 229E and OC43. Both of these viruses usually result in the common cold and rarely cause severe disease on their own. They are often detected at the same time as other respiratory infections. When several viruses, or viruses and bacteria, are found in patients this is called co-infection and can result in more severe disease.
In 2004, NL63 was detected for the first time in a baby suffering from bronchiolitis (a lower respiratory tract infection) in the Netherlands. This virus has probably been around for hundreds of years, we just hadnt found it until then. A year later, in Hong Kong, another coronavirus was found this time in an elderly patient with pneumonia. It was later named HKU1 and has been found to be present in populations around the world.
Deadlier strains
But not all coronaviruses cause a mild disease. Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) caused by SARS-CoV was first detected in November 2002. The cause of this outbreak wasnt confirmed until 2003 when the genome of the virus was identified by Canadas National Microbiology Laboratory. Sars bears many similarities to the current pandemic of COVID-19. Older people were much more likely to suffer severe disease and symptoms included fever, cough, muscle pain and sore throat. But there was a much greater chance of dying if you had Sars. From 2002 until the last reported case in 2014, 774 people died.
A decade later, in 2012, there was another outbreak involving a newly identified coronavirus: MERS-CoV. The first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) occurred in Saudi Arabia. There were two further Mers outbreaks: South Korea in 2015 and Saudi Arabia in 2018. There are a handful of Mers cases every year, but the outbreaks are usually well contained.
So why did Sars or Mers not result in pandemics? The R0 of both Sars and SARS-CoV-2 is about two or three (although some more recent estimates of the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 are around five), meaning that every infected person is likely to infect two or three other people. The symptoms of Sars were more severe, so it was much easier to identify and isolate patients.
The R0 of Mers is below one. It is not very contagious. Most of the cases have been linked to close contact with infected camels or very close contact with an already infected person.
One of the main challenges in containing the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is that symptoms can be very mild some people may not even show any symptoms at all but can still infect other people. SARS-CoV-2 is not as deadly as either Sars or Mers, but because it can spread undetected, the numbers of people it will infect and the numbers that will die will be higher than any coronavirus we have ever encountered. So please, stay at home.

Welcome to the latest edition of Pardon The Intrusion, TNWs bi-weekly newsletter in which we explore the wild world of security.
Since COVID-19 began spreading all over the world, governments have embraced a variety of invasive contact-tracing measures via smartphones. Now Apple and Google have teamed up in a rare joint effort to do just that while possibly still preserving the privacy of individuals who use them.
A few weeks ago they proposed an opt-in automated system which will use Bluetooth-based identifiers to keep track of whether a smartphones owner has come into contact with someone who is later positively diagnosed with coronavirus.
Most importantly, it will be interoperable between the two dominant smartphone platforms Android and iOS and will turned off on a region-by-region basis when the pandemic is over.
The project influenced by similar proposals from researchers at Carnegie Mellon (NOVID), MIT (Private Kit: Safe Paths), Stanford (COVID Watch), and TCN Coalition is an important step because it makes zero use of location data. (This, however, doesnt prevent apps using Google and Apples API from asking for your location data anyway.)
While its clear that the upcoming system has some privacy advantages, its essential that it doesnt collect any information it shouldnt and stores as much data as possible on the users device rather than in a central server.
Similar debates around Bluetooth tracking are taking place in Europe too, including approaches such as Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP3T) and Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT).
Digital contact tracing for tackling COVID-19 is far from perfect and ready for prime time, but the plan is to automate the process and hopefully lay the groundwork for something that could be useful against similar health emergencies in the future.
But even with this Bluetooth tech, there are still some hurdles: It would need a widespread adoption and people would have to trust the system enough to share their proximity data and infection status. Plus, such solutions may not adequately account for the potential abuse and the risk of false positives, or the possibility of a correlation attack.
I suspect the tracing apps are really just do-something-itis, security researcher Ross Anderson said.
Yet theres a paradox here. If the app is voluntary, nobody really has an incentive to use it, and the efficacy of contact tracing becomes extremely limited. On the other hand, if its made compulsory in workplaces, schools, universities, and grocery stores, it could easily defeat the opt-in nature of the system thus inadvertently feeding the mass surveillance system it was meant to stop.
After all, its impossible for Apple and Google to go after businesses and governments and stop them from forcing it on the society at large. This is an ethical dilemma that neither seem to be addressing as yet.
Whats trending in security?
Google is blocking more than 18 million malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 daily, with over 240 million COVID-related spam messages filtered daily. Security firm Carbon Black said ransomware attacks against corporations it monitored jumped 148% in March from the previous month. In a piece of good news, Jitsi, the open-source video calling platform, said its working on end-to-end encryption.

On the flip side, more than 500,000 Zoom accounts were found being sold on the dark web.

Remediating security bugs can take a long time. At least, thats the consensus from a new report from Kenna Security, which analyzed the time to remediation across a number of firms and learned that 45% of vulnerabilities are closed in the first month, two-thirds are closed within three months, and just under 20% stick around longer than a year.
Takeaway: To date, there are over 130,000 vulnerabilities published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). But its not just a matter of fixing them, as organizations need to identify every affected system and ensure theyre patched the right way. In a world where a single high-risk vulnerability can have catastrophic consequences, effective patch prioritization and speed are the keys to security regardless of the type of device or software it sits on, the report says.
Thats it. See you all in two weeks. Stay safe!

You'll get a list of the posts you've recently liked, and then you can choose one to show in your chat. If you've never tried a video chat on Instagram, here's how to start it: In the home screen, tap the arrow button in the top right to open Direct, tap the video icon in the top right, and then choose a user. 
Instagram also said it would include more educational resources in Instagram Search, add stickers to promote accurate information, as well as remove COVID-19-related misinformation.

Finally, the company is rolling out a donation sticker in more countries to help people find relevant nonprofit organizations to support, as well as a ""Stay Home"" sticker to promote social distancing.

But despite the fact that quarantining for the coronavirus pandemic has made the outside world feel like a strange apparition, you should still be washing your hands really, really well, even if you're practicing social distancing as carefully as possible. 
How do we know this, though? 
It's all thanks to Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician from the 19th century. 
Semmelweis, widely-considered to be the first person to suggest that handwashing would prevent the spread of life-threatening germs, is being honored today with a Google Doodle recognizing the continued importance of his discovery. 
SEE ALSO: Oh my god, just wash your hands
The new Doodle, which will remain up for 48 hours, also outlines the World Health Organization's guidelines for proper handwashing, which are crucial  for curbing the spread of coronavirus. (You can also follow WHO's advice for the public concerning COVID-19, the official term for the virus, here.)
But we only know about the importance of proper handwashing because on this day (173 years ago), Semmelweis was appointed Chief Resident within the maternity clinic in the Vienna General Hospital.  There, he later found that making doctors wash their hands could reduce the amount of transmitted diseases, as referenced in a statement from Google sent to Mashable. 
At the time, an infection, commonly called ""childbed fever,"" caused high mortality rates in maternity wards around Europe. Semmelweis, determined to discover the cause, launched an investigation at two maternity wards at his Vienna hospital, one staffed by doctors and medical students and one staffed by female midwives, as reported by NPR. 
He found that new mothers in the clinic with doctors and medical students were dying at a much higher rate. After testing other theories, Semmelweis finally found the link: Medical staff at the clinic with the higher death rate were not washing their hands between patient examinations, thus transmitting infectious material from other operations to those in the maternity clinic. 
Semmelweis instituted mandatory handwashing among the medical staff in the clinic, and infection rates plunged. 
Back then, his findings were not widely heeded. That shouldn't be the case now, with agreed-upon science behind the importance of handwashing in preventing infections and an increasingly urgent need for everyone to take proper measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
So, continue to follow guidelines from medical professionals, and do Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis a favor: Wash your hands."

Instagram account @bestmemes was banned from the platform on Monday morning after posting misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the weekend, according to Daily Dot

The fake tweets read due to the CoronaVirus, if your state is currently under lockdown, you are eligible for $1000 via @PayPal by completing the #StayAtHome survey. Stay strong everyone. They included a PayPal screenshot showing a balance of $1,448.71.

However, not long after the posts were removed, the fake Obama tweet was reposted on the @bestmemes account. It was again taken down later that night.
A spokesperson for Facebook, Instagrams parent company, confirmed to Daily Dot that it had removed the account over repeated community standards violations. The social network, along with other big tech companies like Google and Microsoft, released a statement
 earlier this month committing to jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus. 
Its notable that an Instagram account with so many followers would partake in this scam. Obviously, with so many followers, it was capable of quickly spreading misinformation. 
With close to 14 million followers, the @bestmemes account could have been used for legitimate business endeavors. The @fuckjerry Instagram account, for example, was parlayed into a successful although controversial
 internet media company. As Daily Dot notes, the @fuckjerry Instagram account has around 15 million followers.
Regardless, its an encouraging move from Instagram to remove fraudulent content clearly trying to prey on peoples financial concerns while many are out of work during this global pandemic."

Those antibodies can then provide immunity from future attacks.
John Swartzberg, professor emeritus of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, said it's ""likely, but not yet established"" that antibodies produced to fight off the novel coronavirus will prevent a second infection, at least temporarily.
""There is every reason to think the antibodies we produce against COVID will protect us, based on our experience with other coronaviruses and most, but not all, other infectious diseases,"" Swartzberg told Business Insider.
A March 14 report indicated that monkeys that recovered from exposure to the novel coronavirus did not develop a second infection when re-exposed. And we know most humans who survive COVID-19 develop antibodies specific to the disease.
""That's a good sign that we likely have at least temporary immunity after infection,"" Frances Lund, chair of the microbiology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told Business Insider. ""What we don't know yet is how long that immunity will last, the quality of that immunity, and whether all individuals will generate a long-lasting high immune response.""
Another wrinkle is whether everyone who is exposed to the virus develops antibodies, and whether they develop enough to ward off reinfection. A pre-print study from Chinese researchers that hasn't been peer-reviewed yet found that of 175 recovered COVID-19 patients, nearly 6% didn't have detectable antibodies.

Additionally, some antibodies remain in the body forever while others fade over time, which is why you may need booster immunity for diseases like meningitis and hepatitis A &amp; B.
Comparing COVID-19 to related viruses could help us find out how long we could be immune
Because COVID-19 is in the same virus family as SARS, researchers are focusing on patterns seen in that disease.
""It is way too soon to get any kind of definitive data,"" Drexel University epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur said, but he cited a study of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak in China that found immunity from that virus lasted an average of two years.
A 2017 study of SARS patients similarly showed that 89% of those who recovered had detectable antibodies two years after infection. At the six-year mark, though, only two out of 23 patients still had detectable antibodies, suggesting a diminished defense against the virus.
And the novel coronavirus is an RNA virus, like influenza, which means it can mutate. When that happens antibodies built up against one strain aren't always effective against another. (That's why we need a new flu shot every season.)
But, Lund said, the current coronavirus ""isn't changing too much, so we hope this will be less of an issue.""
Tim Schacker, director of the University of Minnesota's HIV medicine program, said that based on similar illnesses, ""I presume that once you have [COVID-19], if you get it again, it will be a milder course.""
There have been reports of patients who have seemingly fought off the coronavirus only to test positive again weeks or even days later. But those could be attributed to flaws in testing, Florian Krammer, a virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, told The New York Times.
""I'm not saying that reinfection can't occur, will never occur, but in that short time it's unlikely,"" Krammer said.
How long could acquired immunity to COVID-19 last?
It's too early to know if exposure will grant lifelong protection from COVID-19, but Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he believed someone infected in March would have immunity at least through September, when a second wave of the virus could hit.
""If this virus acts like every virus we know, once you get infected, you get better, clear the virus, and then you will have immunity that will protect you against reinfection,"" he told the Daily Show's Trevor Noah in late March.
Scientists are hoping so-called serological tests could test for antibodies specific to the coronavirus in people's blood, and that those with them — and the immunity they provide — could return to work earlier.
As Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, ""only the first glimmers of data are available about immunity to"" COVID-19, and scientists are rushing to figure out the rest.

What's not so clear is if climate change had an impact on the origin of the virus. 
Business Insider Today spoke with Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), to learn more about the relationship between climate change and diseases like COVID-19. 
According to Andersen, ""the health of our planet plays a super important role in spreading or containing what we refer to as Zoonotic diseases."" 
From what scientists know so far, COVID-19 is likely a zoonotic disease, meaning it was probably transferred from animals to humans. 
Zoonotic diseases are not uncommon. SARS, MERS, Zika, and Ebola are all zoonotic diseases — and more new ones are emerging. 
Andersen said that ""75% or so of new infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature.""
Some experts think this increase might be related to an increase in deforestation and the subsequent increase in contact between humans and animal species. One study of Ebola found that the disease was more prevalent in areas that had recently been deforested. 
""When we encroach on nature, when we destroy forest, when we degrade the environment, then we are disturbing what is supposed to be left undisturbed,"" said Andersen.  
The coronavirus crisis is also impacting waste streams as more face masks and medical gowns are used and then thrown away. Andersen noted that many countries may not have the infrastructure or capacity to properly dispose of this waste.

Gerard Tuzara, an operations manager at Amazon's Hawthorne facility, died of the virus on March 31, Business Insider has learned. 
Tuzara is the first known case of death from the coronavirus disease among Amazon employees. Amazon's spokesperson confirmed his death in an email to Business Insider.
""We are saddened by the passing of a member of our management team in Hawthorne, California. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues,"" the spokesperson said.
It's unclear where Tuzara first contracted the disease. His last day at work was March 6, as he went on a vacation to Mexico until March 20. Shortly upon returning to the US, Tuzara started experiencing flu-like symptoms on March 26 and was subsequently hospitalized, Amazon's spokesperson said. Amazon has been in contact with Tuzara's family every day since late March, and all site employees were made aware of his passing on March 31, the spokesperson said. 
Nonetheless, Tuzara's death could further ignite calls for Amazon to build safer working conditions for its warehouse and delivery workers. Groups of employees have expressed concerns over the company's weak safety measures over the past month, staging employee walkouts across several facilities. 
There have been reports of at least 74 Amazon facilities with an infected employee, according to the Washington Post. The Hawthorne facility, called DLA8, is one of the six warehouses in Southern California to have been infected by the disease, according to an LA Times report earlier this month. Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment on the exact number of employees affected by the disease.
In response, Amazon has pledged to add some new safety measures, like providing face masks and regular temperature checks for all of its warehouse employees. It's also increased the hourly pay throughout April, while offering paid time off to those diagnosed with the disease. Amazon is hiring an additional 75,000 new warehouse employees, after having hired 100,000 new workers over the past month.
Still, Amazon has sparked controversy over the way it handled employee calls for better working conditions. Last month, it fired Chris Smalls, the warehouse worker who organized the walkout at its Staten Island facility. On Monday, it fired three more office workers who had been critical of Amazon's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The company said the firings were not retaliatory.
Lawmakers across the country have been critical of Amazon's way of handling workers' protests. Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted on Tuesday urging Amazon to provide a safer workplace.
""Instead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos—the richest man in the world—can focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet,"" Sanders wrote.
Some of Tuzara's friends have left an emotional message in a letter mourning his death that has been circulating Amazon warehouses lately.
""Gerry was an Air Force officer, a loving husband, son and uncle,"" the letter said. ""He will be greatly missed."""

Scientists say there isn't enough evidence to show that the drugs, which can have serious side effects, could treat or prevent COVID-19. But that hasn't stopped the president's remarks from gaining traction with people desperate for potential coronavirus treatments.
Google trends show huge spikes in interest for the two drugs in the past month. Other public figures with no medical background — including Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — have touted the drugs despite scientists' warnings, contributing to the hype.
Now, scammers are cashing in on the public's rising interest in the questionable coronavirus treatments.
Researchers with security rating service NormShield have identified at least 362 new websites pushing questionable coronavirus drugs that have appeared since January. The vast majority of them mention hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, while others mention Remdesivir, a potential coronavirus treatment that's still in early testing. 
Fraudulent sites typically focus on phishing, or the practice of tricking people into hand over personal information. But many of the sites pushing questionable coronavirus treatments aim to extract money from victims, NormShield's Chief Security Officer Bob Maley said.
""In this particular cases, the purpose looks like monetary fraud — trying to get people to hand over money to ostensibly purchase these drugs,"" Maley told Business Insider.
Scammers are used to following news and search trends and exploiting them to make money from people's fears an interests. Coronavirus-related scams are no exception, Maley said, and the majority of the scam sites appeared after Trump began touting the antimalarial drugs in March.
""Where we really started to see the uptick was mid-March,"" he said. ""Elon Musk had tweeted about it, and also President Trump started talking about it, which is when it really took off.""
The sites most likely trick people into spending money on drugs without ever actually shipping any product to victims who fall for the scam. But more broadly, an increased interest in the drugs worldwide has caused a shortage for people who already take them to treat conditions like lupus. Scientists have also warned that misusing them can lead to dire side effects.

Now, most travelers who booked with the company will qualify for penalty-free refunds for bookings. thousands of travelers are canceling their reservations and choosing to stay home. 
Here's what you need to know about booking with Airbnb: 
What is the extenuating circumstances policy?
The company can override those conditions with its Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and that's how many Covid-19-related cancellations may qualify for refunds.
When the Airbnb website recognizes that customers are traveling from or to certain affected areas, an automatic message is generated offering the chance to cancel without a penalty.
Even if travelers don't receive that automated message, they may still cancel their reservation and submit a request for a refund within 14 days of cancellation. 
As President Trump's Schengen Area travel ban goes into effect, and confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the United States rise, Airbnb has made the area covered by the extenuating circumstances policy global. 
All reservations made before March 14th, with check-in dates from March 14th through April 14th, qualify for penalty free cancellations. Both hosts and guests may choose to cancel the booking. 
Airbnb experiences, where travelers can book tours, classes and workshops, are also covered by the new policy. 
The sole exception is for domestic travel in mainland China. On April 1st, standard cancellation policies are back in effect there. 
Not every travel company is offering exceptions for coronavirus cancellations. The vacation rental property Vrbo has not offered any Covid-19-related exceptions to its cancellation policy.
In a March 14th letter, Vrbo president Jeff Hurst recommended that travelers reach out to homeowners to request a penalty-free cancellation.
Addressing homeowners in a letter on March 12th, Hurst suggested that they remain open to such requests. ""In the spirit of good hospitality,"" he wrote, ""we strongly encourage you to offer a full refund."" 
Travelers aren't the only ones feeling the pain of canceled trips. Thousands of Airbnb hosts across the globe are coping with lost income. 
On Airhosts forum, a popular platform for Airbnb hosts, users are sharing their concerns about the financial impact of refunding money. 
In some cases, the 50% deposits paid by guests might be hundreds or even thousands of dollars, money hosts must now return when travelers cancel their bookings whether or not they're in an area impacted by coronavirus. 
On March 14th, the short-term vacation rental group purchasing organization Host GPO posted an open letter to Airbnb about the new refund policy. 
""Extending refunds to practically everyone through April 1st,"" they write, ""will be absolutely devastating to hosts."" Arguing that the decision is a break with company policy, the letter asks that Airbnb reconsider. 
""To prevent hosts from losing their livelihoods, it's important to make sure that hosts survive the unprecedented onslaught of cancellations."""

A company spokesman confirmed to Reuters that the stores will reopen Friday. Some had been closed in early February as a precaution against the coronavirus.
Apple had warned in mid-February that it would not meet its March revenue guidance thanks to the store closures, and production slowdown thanks to the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Later that month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was ""very optimistic"" China had the coronavirus under control, citing reductions in the numbers of new cases being recorded in the country.
Cook added that many suppliers to Apple have reopened factories in the country. Crucially for Apple, this includes its biggest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, whose founder said Thursday that production at its factories had returned to normal.
The reduction in new cases cited by Cook appears to be continuing, too. Wuhan – the Chinese city where the virus originated – reported fewer than 10 new cases for the second day in a row on Friday, while no locally-transmitted contractions of the virus were reported in the rest of China.
The number of new cases outside China is continuing to rise. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that outside China, the number of cases of the virus increased 13-fold in a fortnight.

The announcement brings the number of known FCA workers who have died as a result of the disease to three. 
""One of our members at FCA Warren Truck in Michigan passed away today due to the Coronavirus,"" the statement read. ""On behalf of myself and the entire International Executive Board, I want to extend our sincerest sympathies to the family and friends of our dear member.""
In the statement, Gamble added that ""today FCA officials sent home the few remaining Mopar workers at the parts-distribution center in Center Line, Michigan, after at least one employee tested positive for the virus."" That facility, Gamble said, was being operated by paid volunteers and is being deep cleaned. 
The announcement follows Tuesday's news that two FCA plant workers — one at the company's Kokomo, Indiana, facility and another at its Sterling Heights, Michigan, plant — had died of the disease. According to Automotive News, those two employees were the first known US auto workers to have died from it. 
Last week, the Big Three US automakers — Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler — committed to a full shutdown of North American plants in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has, as of this publishing, infected more than 521,000 people and killed more than 23,000 worldwide. The UAW had been pushing the Big Three to close US plants for days as new cases of the virus among auto workers continued to grow. 
""Today's action is the prudent thing to do,"" Gamble said following the Big Three's announcement of plant closures in North America. ""By taking a shutdown and working through next steps, we protect UAW members, their families and the community."" 
But on Thursday, tensions between the UAW and Ford began to rise again following the manufacturer's announcement that it would restart production at some plants — with additional safety measures in place — to generate extra cash flow. 
""The UAW continues to review with great caution and concern decisions being made about restarting workplaces, especially at advanced dates,"" Gamble said in a statement. ""The only guideline in a boardroom should be management asking themselves, 'Would I send my family — my own son or daughter — into that plant and be 100% certain they are safe.'""

Holland America did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.
The Panama Canal Authority is the autonomous legal body responsible for operating the canal. In a March 27 statement, a Panama Canal Authority spokesperson told Business Insider that, as per Panama's Ministry of Health's protocols, ""if a vessel has individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 on board, it cannot make any port operations or transit the Canal.""
But now, with the authorization of Panama's Ministry of Health, the ship will be ""scheduled for transit after entering Canal waters,"" according to the statement. The statement said that the Zaandam was originally scheduled to transit the canal on April 1.
The Zaandam is now anchored outside Panama Canal waters, undergoing a Panama Maritime Authority-approved operation in which healthy passengers are being moved to Holland America's MS Rotterdam. It has therefore not had its transit scheduled yet.
""Traveling through the Panama Canal will allow the Zaandam to save two days in their journey back to Florida,"" the statement from the Panama Canal Authority's spokesperson said.
Holland America confirmed that four passengers have died on board the ship, while two individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. The Zaandam has been stranded off the coast of South America and Central America after different ports began closing to cruise ships due to coronavirus concerns. A bout of respiratory disease then broke out on the ship, prompting 138 sick passengers and crew members to report to the vessel's medical center.
The cruise on the Zaandam was scheduled to last 14 days, embarking from Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7. For some passengers, the cruise would end after 14 days in San Antonio, Chile. For others, it was due to April 7 in Fort Lauderdale. Those plans were diverted because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the cruise ship rerouted its course to sail north to an undetermined destination.

On Sunday, Trump, who is in damage control mode over the US's slow response to dealing with the COVID-19, reshared a tweet about firing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and one of the top experts on Trump's coronavirus task force, who helped tackle the AIDS, Zika, and Ebola epidemics.
The tweet, which was written by Republican DeAnna Lorraine who is running for Congress, said: ""Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large."" Lorraine's tweet included a hashtag that said: ""Time to #FireFauci.""
It's been about two months since the US's first cases, and 22,023 have died from the virus and 555,398 have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Only a week earlier, Trump stopped Fauci from telling reporters what he thought about using hydroxycloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, on patients with COVID-19. Trump has been vocal about his support for the drug, repeatedly asking: ""What do you have to lose?""
It's not clear whether his retweet is more than a vague threat, but five days ago, he got rid of Glenn Fine, the acting inspector general at the Department of Defense, who had been tasked with overseeing the implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.
Before that, on April 3, he fired intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, who had alerted Congress about the whistleblower's complaint that accused Trump of soliciting foreign election interference.
Trumps' retweet was in response to Fauci speaking to CNN on Sunday, as well as a New York Times report from Saturday that outlined recommendations Fauci backed on February 21.
—Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020
On Saturday, in stark contrast to Lorraine's tweet about Fauci saying the coronavirus posed no threat on February 29, The New York Times reported that Fauci, along with Trump's other top public health experts, said on February 21 that the administration needed to announce aggressive social distancing policies, even at the cost of disrupting normal life and the US economy. 
On Sunday, Business Insider reported Fauci told CNN's ""State of the Union"" earlier in the day that ""no one is going to deny"" that lives could have been saved if the US implemented containment measures earlier on in the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Fauci said fewer people would have died if the Trump administration had announced isolation measures in February instead of late March after fielding warnings from public health officials.
""As I've said many times, we look at it from a pure health standpoint,"" he said. ""We make a recommendation. Often the recommendation is taken. Sometimes it's not. But it is what it is. We are where we are right now.""

We may never find out precisely where or when it occurred, nor the animal which was responsible. But we do know that these spillover events are the starting points of many outbreaks, from influenza to HIV and from SARS to COVID-19.
Zoonotic diseases are caused by pathogens which originate in other animal species. Some diseases, such as rabies, cause sporadic outbreaks, often self-contained but deadly and traumatizing for the communities they infect. Others manage to spread worldwide and become pandemic, circulating in the global population. Some are repeat offenders that re-emerge from animal hosts in a mutated form every few decades think influenza, plague and cholera.
Many others are now part of our burden of endemic diseases, such as measles, mumps or HIV. The coronavirus causing COVID-19 is closely related to those that caused the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003. Despite speculation, its too early to tell whether COVID-19 will disappear within a year or stay with us permanently like the flu.
Either way, we can expect new strains of coronavirus to spill over from wildlife in the future. Countless pathogens jump across animal species on a daily basis most of the time with no visible effect. But increasingly, these pathogens are taking advantage of the new opportunities that humans have created as they reshape the natural environment. In this fraught atmosphere, its natural for misconceptions to circulate, so heres what we know about how new diseases jump from animals to people.
Bush meat and wet markets
Its often assumed that close contact with wild animals is necessary for zoonotic outbreaks like Ebola or COVID-19 to occur. Activities like hunting, butchering and trading wild animal meat for human consumption carry a high risk of exposure to pathogens, but we dont know how often they actually cause diseases. Bats are popular game in several African and Asian countries, where some species weigh over 300g and roost in their thousands in trees. As a result, bat hunters are at particular risk of infection, although there is little evidence to suggest hunters themselves may have been the source of past Ebola outbreaks.
In some countries, live animals destined for human consumption are traditionally sold in wet markets, potentially bringing zoonotic viruses from the forest into towns. But footage of exotic wild animals, sometimes endangered, sold live on overcrowded market stalls, misrepresent a niche trade as mainstream activity.
Surveys in China and Vietnam have shown that wild meat is mainly eaten in restaurants, mostly from wild pigs, goats, deer and birds, all of which are commonly farmed not unlike what happens in Europe. As for bats, which are sold in their tens of thousands in Ghana, they are already dead, eviscerated and smoked by the time they reach market stalls, hence posing a very low risk of infection to consumers.
Vectors
More common routes of spillover do not require direct contact with animals at all. Many emerging diseases are transmitted by biting insects that act as vectors between animal host species. For example, Lyme disease, caused by bacteria found in wild mammals and transmitted to humans by ticks, has been increasing in North America and Europe in the last 30 years. Although this increase is often thought to be driven by deer hunting, studies suggest that the growing abundance of small mammals may be spreading the disease as their natural predators decline.
Ticks can transmit the bacteria that causes Lyme disease when they bite humans. KPixMining/Shutterstock
Other pathogens are excreted in the urine or faeces of their animal host, contaminating drinking water or crops for humans and farm animals. This has been seen in Bangladesh, where bats drink from and urinate into vessels collecting palm sap, causing outbreaks of Nipah virus in local communities.
Domestic animals
Although wild animals transmit zoonotic viruses, people are much more frequently in contact with domestic animals, creating ample opportunities for disease spillover. Poultry can spread bird flu, and there have been sporadic (and often deadly) outbreaks of H5N1 or H7N9 strains in the last 20 years, leading to mass culls in farms.
Although less lethal, bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter, commonly found in farm animals, cause thousands of cases of food poisoning in the UK alone. Even normally harmless bacteria may acquire antibiotic resistance genes in farms that use lots of antibiotics. Outside Europe, antibiotics are often added to animal feed as growth promoters, potentially helping to incubate multidrug-resistant bacteria in livestock.
How to prevent zoonotic disease outbreaks
There are no simple solutions to prevent zoonotic outbreaks, but researchers in our Bat-One-Health consortium are studying how to reinforce three particular lines of defence.
Preserving ecosystems and restoring natural habitats can ensure animals dont need to forage near where humans live. Risky behaviours that expose people to pathogens can be reduced not by imposing harmful bans on wild meat but through community engagement thats respectful of different livelihoods and cultural practices. Most importantly, governments must invest in public health and surveillance where they are needed most.
Understanding how new viruses make the jump from animals to humans can help lower the risk of future pandemics, but it will mean dispelling misconceptions about where most transmission occurs and avoiding knee jerk reactions.

After seeing an initial spike in COVID-19 infections in February, South Korea implemented several measures to bring the diseases spread under control, a progression Ive followed as a researcher on public policy. South Korea was able to lower the number of new infections from 851 on March 3 to 22 infections as of April 17 and the mortality rate from COVID-19 hovers around 2%.
Several measures contribute to Koreas success, but two measures were critical in the countrys ability to flatten the curve: extensive testing for the disease and a national system for promptly and effectively tracking people infected with COVID-19.
Testing and triage
From the 2015 MERS outbreak, Korea learned that infection to medical staff sapped the ability to control the virus as infected citizens in hospitals turned them into hotspots for infection. As a result, at the onset of COVID-19 infection, the Korean government ensured that proper personal protective equipment was provided to avoid infection to the medical staff. It also created physically separated testing and treatment sites for health care workers.
Once safe testing and treatment facilities were secured, the government began testing for COVID-19 at massive scale over 440,000 people which essentially covered all those with symptoms. People who test positive are quarantined in COVID-19 special units and treated.

South Korea focuses attention on treating people with severe symptoms and therefore less likelihood of recovery, rather than focusing on people with mild symptoms. This helped lower the mortality rate of COVID-19, as some of the most vulnerable populations with severe symptoms recovered. Countries focusing their effort on treating patients with a greater likelihood of survival may lead to a higher mortality rate as more vulnerable patients perish.
Extensive testing is a crucial step in identifying the state of the infection in the country where the outbreaks are taking place, who is infected and who is not. This data then becomes a stepping stone for identifying any hotspots of infection in the country and to trace and identify the population that came in contact with those infected.
COVID-19 contact tracing system with roots in MERS
What distinguishes the Korean model in controlling COVID-19 is its ability to trace individuals diagnosed with the disease who may have come into contact with the infected individuals. Its known as the COVID-19 Smart Management System (SMS).
South Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) runs the contact tracing system that uses data from 28 organizations such as National Police Agency, The Credit Finance Association, three smartphone companies, and 22 credit card companies to trace the movement of individuals with COVID-19. This system takes 10 minutes to analyze the movement of infected individuals. For people who come in contact with an infected person, the KCDC informs the local public health center near the infected citizens residence and the health center sends the notification to them. If they test positive, they are hospitalized at the COVID-19 special facilities. Those without symptoms are asked to remain self-quarantined for 14 days.
The legal basis for accessing such personal information was prepared after the 2015 MERS outbreak when the government learned that tracing the movement of infected individuals and people who came in contact with them is crucial. As a safety measure, only epidemic investigators at KCDC can access the location information and once the COVID-19 outbreak is over, the personal information used for the contact tracing will be purged.
Could the US emulate South Korea?
South Koreas model relying on rapid testing availability, safe COVID-19 medical facilities and a government-run contact tracing system helps avoid an authoritarian approach of shutting down an entire city as we have seen in China. A forced lockdown has democratic and human consequences of restricting individual freedom and stockpiling. It may have lasting consequences in the post-COVID-19 world such as the abuse of political power and the threat to freedom through intrusive surveillance.
Currently, the U.S. is considering re-opening the country or states out of concern over the economy. But without effective measures in place to contain the virus, it may lead to exponential growth in infection again.
Epidemiologists have said the key to defeating COVID-19 pandemic is in identifying hotspots of infection and severing the vicious cycle of infection. An effective contact tracing system is a crucial component in this approach and this can be potentially emulated in the U.S.
The U.S. has the necessary technology and data and the government could form a partnership with the relevant entities, such as credit card and telecommunications companies, law enforcement, health care, and other related public and private organizations to create a COVID-19 contact tracing system. With the help of such a system, the government could identify the infected population and hotspots, trace and quarantine them for treatment in medical facilities that are, with the governments continued effort, supplied with the necessary PPE.
At the citizen level, the practice of wearing masks and social distancing should be strongly encouraged to prevent infection while the government tries to flatten the curve.
Currently, there is a sense of normalcy returning to South Korea. No cities are under lockdown, the restaurants, churches, bars, gyms, and learning institutes are allowed to open if they observe the government quarantine guidelines, trains, and buses run on schedule, grocery stores are fully stocked, and the country just successfully held parliamentary elections in mid-April. Citizens wear masks and exercise social distancing at all times which helps prevent further infection. South Koreas approach to COVID-19 with its focus on technology suggests a possible path for the U.S. in reopening the country without having to subject citizens to the coercive authority of the state and compromise our democratic ideal.

The announcement came one day after an employee from the company's Everett, Washington, plant died of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The worker, who was not immediately named, was the first death from the virus among the company's workforce.
There were 29 confirmed cases of the virus among Boeing's employees as of Sunday, the Seattle Times reported. 24 of those were in the Puget Sound area of Washington.
In a press release, the company said that affected employees who could not work from home would continue to be paid for 10 business days, covering the entire suspension period.
""These actions are being taken to ensure the well-being of employees, their families and the local community, and will include an orderly shutdown consistent with the requirements of its customers,"" the press release said.
""This necessary step protects our employees and the communities where they work and live,"" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in the release. ""We continue to work closely with public health officials, and we're in contact with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders who are affected by this temporary suspension.""
About 70,000 employees work at the two major factories and several smaller facilities in the Puget Sound region. The company's other production sites, in Missouri, South Carolina, Arizona, and Pennsylvania, will remain open.
Washington, which has been among the hardest-hit states so far, was the first to declare a state of emergency.

""I told you a few days ago that [Musk] was likely to have 1,000 ventilators this week,"" Newsom said, adding: ""They've arrived in Los Angeles... It was a heroic effort.""
Last week, after Newsom said he had spoken with a ""well-known entrepreneur"" about ventilators, Musk hinted that plans for production were already underway at Tesla factories, tweeting: ""We're working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter.""
Musk has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, calling the panic surrounding it ""dumb"" and falsely claiming that children are ""essentially immune"" to the virus, despite evidence to the contrary. Musk also initially hedged his promise about producing ventilators just minutes after making it, speculating that there wouldn't be a shortage after all — also flying in the face of experts' predictions.
A February report from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins estimated the US has about 160,000 ventilators ready for use in hospitals, with another 8,900 held in a national reserve. But one expert warned that, as the virus continues to spread across the US, one million Americans could need the life-saving devices.
In response to that potential shortage, General Motors and Ford have both said they will help produce ventilators as various sectors of the US economy reconfigure themselves to help meet the surging demand for medical supplies.

In a March 25 letter addressed to Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, says such matters — ""bond hearings for adult detainees and emergency hearings for children"" — should, instead, be handled via teleconference.
""The benefit for reducing the risk to public health outweighs pressing forward with non-critical matters during this pandemic,"" Feinstein added.

A spokesperson for Feinstein said the senator has not yet received a response to her letter.
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Judge Dana Leigh Marks, whose court in San Francisco remains open despite a local order to shelter in place, told Insider that little has changed since and the National Association of Immigration Judges, where she serves as president emerita, last week called for her courtroom — and all 60-plus immigration courtrooms that still remain open — to be shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Department of Justice that oversees the immigrant court system, has started to implement telework, Marks said, ""but it is going forward at glacial speed.""
""We continue to advocate for a complete closure of all courts,"" she said, ""for two to four weeks, until the medical experts weigh in on what measures need to be taken to flatten the curve and protect all in our courtrooms from unnecessary medical risks.""
In the past week, suspected COVID-19 cases have caused the temporary closure of immigration courts in New York, New Jersey, and Colorado, the Associated Press reported. 
According to EOIR, just six out of the 68 US immigration courts are closed right now, and one of those is opening back up on March 30.

He only informed the crew of his test results after the plane had landed.
""Last night's event put our crew members, customers, and federal and local officials in an unsettling situation that could have easily been avoided, and as such, this customer will not be permitted to fly on JetBlue in the future,"" the airline said told CNN in a statement Thursday.
The man boarded JetBlue flight 253 at John F. Kennedy Airport and landed at West Palm Beach International Airport on Wednesday night along with 114 other passengers. According to JetBlue, he did not alert anyone at the airline that he had taken a test for COVID-19.
Passenger Scott Rodman, who was sitting next to the man's wife, told WPTV that the wife had told him that they knew about his positive test results before the flight left JFK. 
""His wife was sitting in the same row as me and mentioned to others that he wasn't feeling well,"" Rodman, who wore gloves and a mask on the flight, told WPTV. ""She said he had gotten a phone call with his test results right before we had taken off, implying that he had a positive test but not actually saying it.""
Upon arrival, the passenger notified the crew that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey immediately began to clean the areas he came into contact with based on security footage, including gates, security checkpoints, check-in counters, kiosks, elevators, and restrooms, CNN reported.
The other passengers on JetBlue flight 253 were briefed by local health officials on the plane for nearly two hours after the plane landed just before 9 p.m. 
""Passengers in the vicinity of the positive patient were advised of monitoring procedures,"" Palm Beach County Fire Rescue said in a statement to ABC news.""The rest of the passengers were released to go home,"" and instructed to call the local health department with any other concern. 
The Palm Beach International Airport temporarily closed down Concourse A for sanitizing after passengers on the same flight exited the area. However, the airport will continue operating as normal the day after the incident, CNN reported. 
The passenger's condition and his whereabouts remain unclear. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended those at high risk of getting sick from COVID-19 to avoid non-essential air travel.  New York is one of at least 30 states that have declared a state of emergency in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Bank of America offers three types of personal loans: home loans, auto loans, and credit cards. The bank is offering deferment on all three loans for customers in good standing. 
How to apply for loan deferment through Bank of America
Bank of America is offering up to 90 days of deferment for home loans, auto loans, and credit cards. The bank is not pausing any payments automatically — you must apply manually.
To apply, visit the bank's coronavirus response page and select ""request payment deferral"" near the top of the page. This link will lead you to a deferral application for all three types of loans.
""Bank of America is deferring mortgage payments for up to 90 days or until the crisis is over,"" Bank of America representative Bill Halden told Business Insider.
If you're still struggling financially due to the coronavirus after 90 days, contact Bank of America. The bank will handle these instances on a case-by-case basis.
Deferral is available for customers who are current on their loan payments. There is a little leeway — for example, if you're only a week late on your payment, you should still qualify for deferral.
Bank of America deferments for each type of loan
Deferred home loan payments will be tacked onto the end of your loan term
You can apply for deferral on your Bank of America home loan, including mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit.
If you defer your Bank of America home loan, interest will continue to accrue. The missed payments are tacked onto the end of your loan term, which means you won't have to pay the total amount after the deferment period ends, but the term of your loan will lengthen. 
You don't have to skip payments completely when you defer. You may choose to make smaller payments each month or to pay the lump sum at any time.
Bank of America will not report late or missed payments to credit bureau agencies. The bank also will not foreclose on your home or evict you.
If you have a home loan through federal mortgage companies Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, Bank of America will follow those companies' policies on handling home loans during the pandemic. Federal policies regarding home loans are changing frequently, so check the Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae websites to ensure you have up-to-date information.
If you want to talk to a Bank of America representative about your home loan, call 1-(800)-669-6650.
Auto loan deferrals work similarly to home loan deferrals
Bank of America's policies for auto loans are similar to to its policies for home loans. You can request extended payment assistance if you continue to face hardship after the 90-day deferment period, and you can make modified payments at any time.
As with home loan payments, interest will continue to build, and any payments you miss will be added to the end of your loan term.
To speak with a representative about your auto loan, call 1-(800)-386-4017.
Credit card payments are on hold
Credit card payment deferrals work a little differently than home or auto loan deferrals. When you a pay off a credit card, you don't have a strict due date that you're expected to pay off the loan, like with other types of loans (although it's always best to pay your monthly bill in full, if you can). So when you defer your Bank of America credit card payment, your payments aren't tacked onto the end of a loan. Payments are just on hold until the deferral period ends.
Remember that interest still accrues during the deferral period, and rates are typically higher than home or auto loan rates.
To speak with a Bank of America representative about your credit card payments, call 1-(888)-800-5160.

Here's how Germany turned itself around as one of the European countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases to having one of the lowest mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide.
January: Germany's unconcerned about coronavirus
In January, when COVID-19 was ravaging China, Germany still regarded the illness as a far-off, and likely minor, threat. In late January, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that COVID-19 posed a very low health risk.
But it took just a few days for signs of trouble to erupt. Germany had discovered its first few COVID-19 cases by January 27, but thought they were little more than local threats that could be easily managed.
Germany wasn't the only country with this reaction. On January 22, US President Donald Trump was asked whether he was worried about the coronavirus outbreak. ""It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,"" Trump said. ""It's going to be just fine.""
At the time, Germany and the US seemed to be on the same page.
February: Germany has one of the highest infection rates in the world
Over the course of February, the situation had changed dramatically in Germany. 
The coronavirus threat was increasing by the day and with 48 confirmed cases by February 28, Germany had the second-highest number of cases in Europe behind Italy's 644 cases. It was also just behind the 60 cases confirmed in the US.
That seemed to be the point at which Germany and the US started to diverge in their response to COVID-19. Just two days prior, on February 26, Trump said that the US coronavirus threat was ""going down, not up."" The next day, he said the threat would, ""like a miracle,"" evaporate.
But Germany sprung into action. 
Late February and early March: Germany's forceful and rapid response
By the time Trump made his comments, Germany was already taking action to address the coronavirus threat.
In late February, the country extended school and daycare facility closures and required anyone who had contact with confirmed cases to remain in isolation for 14 days. Even in unconfirmed cases — those who had been near someone with coronavirus-like symptoms — were told to self-isolate. 
Meanwhile, the government said that it would limit outside travel into the country and begin acquiring protective medical equipment to prepare for the COVID-19 fight. Along the way, despite an inability to get rapid test results, Germany was ramping up its testing efforts.
""Germany was able to react to the situation unfolding in China in January and have testing established by mid-February,"" said epidemiology professor at Yale School of Public Health Nathan Grubaugh. ""They could do this in part because Germany doesn't have a centralized diagnostic system so labs around the country were free to establish tests."" In fact, as of April 2, private labs in Germany have helped the country test 1 million people for COVID-19. 
Germany was one of the first countries to develop a  testing system for COVID-19. It's capacity to test for COVID-19 early on meant that Germany could ""get a much better handle on who was infected, isolate contacts, and treat those who need care,"" Jennifer Kates, the senior vice president and global health and HIV policy director at the Kaiser Family Foundation said.
March 9-10: The first deaths
Despite widespread testing efforts, the German coronavirus outbreak continued. 
By March 9, Germany had approximately 1,200 cases and had recorded its first two deaths. The same day, the US had accumulated 950 cases and 28 deaths. German chancellor Angela Merkel and her administration told Germany that they would need to do ""everything possible"" to slow the coronavirus spread and save lives and announced that gatherings of more than 1,000 people would be shut down.
This was 7 days before Trump recommended social distancing measures based on CDC guidelines.
But perhaps what has contributed to Germany's low death rate most is an ace up its sleeve that many other countries can't match: An extremely high bed-to-person ratio. According to data from HealthSystemTracker, Germany has 8.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people and 6.1 ICU beds per 1,000 people. Italy has 3.2 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.6 ICU beds per 1,000.
The US has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.4 ICU beds per 1,000 people.
""Germany hospital capacity surpasses that of many other countries,"" Kates said. It's been a key factor in saving lives and not overwhelming a strained healthcare system.
March 17: A bigger risk — and problems testing
On March 17, the Robert Koch Institute, which monitors public health across the country, changed COVID-19's health risk to ""high"" in Germany. 
The German government said that because of a lag of about three to four days between testing and results, it believed the real number of cases was higher than the recorded 7,000, or so. Germany quickly expanded the number of COVID-19 beds by 1,000 to accommodate extra needs.
In the ensuing days, more curfews and quarantines went into effect. Social distancing, a core component in any country's battle with COVID-19, was further tightened as schools, daycare facilities, and other gathering limitations were extended. At the right time, Germany responded forcefully, experts said.
""The factors [in Germany's success] have not been in place in other settings,"" Kates said. ""The US has largely bungled its testing effort and Italy's hospitals have been overwhelmed. These are very hard barriers to overcome once countries are at this point."" 
But Germany wasn't done. 
March 22: A widespread crackdown
By March 22, Germany's cases hovered at around 25,000, but deaths were just 86 — a fatality rate of approximately 0.3% that easily outpaced China, Italy, and nearly every other country around the world.
That day, the German government announced that people would need to remain six feet apart, and gatherings of more than two people were forbidden. Germans were also asked to stay home, unless necessary.
It was a move made just a day after Italy announced similar national restrictions on movement and non-essential business activity. But by then, the differences between Germany and Italy were stark: Italy reached more than 59,000 cases that day and nearly 5,500 deaths.
In the US, the coronavirus battle was ramping up. On March 22, the US 140 deaths that day and 557 cumulative fatalities. A mortality rate of 1.2%. This is partly due to the country's slow roll out of tests early on, Grubaugh said. 
Late March into April: Questions abound
Statistics indicate that Germany is in a far better place than many of the other developed countries worldwide. And testing may be central to its success.
Late last month, Germany said that it could conduct 160,000 tests each week, and has been able to test more than 2,000 per million people. It's now using rapid testing to identify patients within hours, and it's not letting up.
""It's becoming clear that the countries that rolled out rapid wide-scale testing are the ones that are also controlling the virus better,"" Grubaugh said. 
""If countries that have yet to see surging cases can implement early widespread testing, isolation of those infected and contact tracing, coupled with shoring up their health system capacity, they can see success,"" Kates said.
Germany hit all the right marks. But the fight remains.
Experts cautioned that Germany may not have reached its peak. The country added about 4,000 new cases on March 28. On March 30 cases were up 4,600 to a cumulative total of 61,913.
Meanwhile, deaths are increasing. On March 29, Germany recorded 66 deaths due to COVID-19. That figure increased 128 on March 30. Germany's death rate is now 1.2% -- still lower compared to many other parts of the world.
It's unclear what might be happening in Germany and whether the worst is behind the country. But there are clear indications that this story is far from over.
""Germany is not out of the woods yet,"" Kates said.

Integrated into HVAC systems, the technology utilizes specialized tubes that take oxygen molecules from the air and convert them into charged atoms that then cluster around microparticles, surrounding and deactivating harmful substances like airborne mold, bacteria, allergens, and viruses.
They also attach to expelled breath droplets and dust particles that can transport viruses, enlarging them so they're more easily caught in filters. It's an active process that provides continuous disinfection.
""The ions produce a chemical reaction on the cell membrane surface that inactivates the virus,"" Philip Tierno, a clinical professor of microbiology and pathology at the NYU School of Medicine, told Business Insider. ""It can reduce 99.9% of microbes in a matter of minutes.""
The battle against the coronavirus could be an air fight 
Concerns about airborne transmission have grown as new research indicates the novel coronavirus can remain airborne longer and spread further than previously thought. Some experts now believe that just normal breathing can spread the virus.
""The possibility of aerosolized spread of COVID-19 and the ability of particles to hang in the air for extended periods of time would make the consideration of an active air-cleaning strategy even more prudent,"" Tierno said.
Long popular in Europe, bipolar ionization first arrived in the US in the 1970s as a tool to control pathogens in food manufacturing. It was effective during the SARS outbreak of 2004, as well as more recent outbreaks of MERS and norovirus and various strains of influenza.
Recent advances have made units cheaper and easier to install and companies are scrambling to test the technology against the coronavirus. According to Tierno, early results have been positive: ""Because coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, they are easier to kill compared to naked viruses like noroviruses.""
Many large venues already employ bipolar ionization
Hospitals including Johns Hopkins, Children's Hospital Boston and the University of Maryland Medical Center have already embraced the technology.
""Bipolar ionization has been used in healthcare for many years for many applications,"" Tony Abate, chief technical officer at AtmosAir Solutions, told Business Insider. ""We believe bipolar ion systems will become a standard in these critical environments to protect patients and staff.

Terminals at LaGuardia, O'Hare, LAX, and San Francisco International Airport already have AtmosAir units in place. Tampa's Amalie Arena and the TWA Hotel at JFK airport are adopting bipolar ionization technology, as are large workplaces such as Google's headquarters in Chicago and San Jose.
There are also options for the home, including standalone portable devices and additions to HVAC systems.
""Events like this, unfortunately, act as a wake-up call to understand the implications of not addressing indoor air quality,"" Larry Sunshine, president of bipolar-ionization company Plasma Air, said. ""In the past, improving indoor air quality was oftentimes viewed as a luxury. Now it needs to be viewed as essential.""

Fauci told CNN's New Day that the Trump administration is considering giving out certificates showing a person has previously had coronavirus and recovered, which could help reduce transmission as people return to work in the coming months.
""I mean, it's one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not,"" he said. ""This is something that's being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit, under certain circumstances.""
Fauci added that the federal government is preparing to deploy a ""large number"" of antibody tests in the coming week, which the Food and Drug Administration is currently validating.
While existing coronavirus tests tell people whether they have the virus or not, an antibody test shows if someone has previously had the virus and recovered, which could mean they're immune. Deploying them would be a part of the next phase of the government's plan to reopen the economy.
""Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of tests that are available,"" Fauci said Friday.
The government is also exploring partnering with private sector companies to monitor the spread of the virus. Apple and Google are currently partnering for a contact-tracing program that will use Bluetooth data from people's smartphones to gauge whether they've come in contact with someone exposed to coronavirus.
CDC Director Robert Redfield told NPR on Thursday that ""very aggressive"" measures including contact tracing will be necessary for the US to return to normal.

Under the Emergency Money for the People Act, US citizens who are 16 or older — and make less than $130,000 a year — would receive cash payments from the federal government for at least six months, and until unemployment falls to pre-pandemic levels.
The bill was introduced Tuesday by Rep. Tim Ryan, a former presidential candidate associated with the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, and Rep. Ro Khanna, former co-chair of Sen.

The experimental digital arm of the NHS — NHSX — has been developing a tracing app for some weeks, but was blindsided by a joint announcement last week by Apple and Google on a contact-tracing system that sets limits on how invasive such apps can be on iPhones or Android devices.
Now there's a conflict between the political win of getting the app out on time, and actually ensuring it works properly.
Apple and Google are not building an app themselves, but released a set of privacy-focused APIs in May on which governments and public health agencies like the NHS can base their own contact-tracing apps.
A key advantage of the system is that approved contact-tracing apps will be able to run in the background. Contact-tracing apps mostly rely on Bluetooth scanning, which normally isn't permitted to run in the background on iOS. For example, Singapore's Bluetooth-based TraceTogether app reportedly requires the user to leave their phone unlocked to work properly — a privacy risk and a battery drain. Adopting the Apple and Google system means approved apps would work properly even when a phone is locked, making it more likely people would actually download them.
But in order to access this better functionality, governments and public health authorities must ensure their apps meet the tech giants' privacy standards. The idea here is to ensure governments don't push out highly invasive apps that track people's movements through location data, or build up centralized databases of people's medical information.
According to people familiar with the matter, the NHSX app may not meet Apple and Google's privacy restrictions but has already been announced by the government and is at an advanced stage of development. These people said NHSX is in discussions with Apple currently.

Although the NHSX app is not expected to be especially invasive, sources suggested that NHSX's view of the ideal balance between specificity of tracing and privacy differs from that of Apple and Google. The cybersecurity arm of the UK's spy agency GCHQ, the NCSC, is also thought to be advising on the app.
Ross Anderson, a University of Cambridge professor who advised on the app's security and development, told BI that UK authorities want ""fine-grained"" contact tracing. The logic here is that it would enable the UK's epidemiologists to take more effective action in response to COVID-19.
Now it isn't clear that the app meets Apple and Google's standards, and whether it would work properly, particularly on the iPhone.
Anderson told Business Insider: ""The NHSX people [have] this delightful choice between an app that won't work... or an app that will run on the platform but won't enable them to do the epidemiology they want.""
Jon Crowcroft, Marconi professor of Communications Systems at the University of Cambridge, raised similar questions.
""Apple and Google's policies on all COVID-19 related apps was that if they came from a government health agency, subject to normal other checks, they'd be okayed,"" he told Business Insider, saying that it wasn't clear if the NHSX app might be blocked.
Ultimately, practicality may win out over politics. The obvious solution would be to rebuild the app on Apple and Google's APIs.
Another source said: ""Everyone expects the [Department of Health] to rewrite their app to use the API, and claim victory.""
NHSX and Apple did not return a request for comment."

Furloughs in the UK mean temporary suspension of employment. The worker is still employed, but the government covers up to 80% of their salary to a maximum of £2,500 per month and they do not continue working. Employers can choose to cover the remaining 20%, or not.
Sources estimated that the furloughs had affected around 100 staff and said they took place in early April.
The changes impact front-of-house and office staff, since employees are working from home, as well as some engineers unable to be deployed to other areas of the business.
Babylon Health is headquartered in the UK, and is best known for its doctor app that provides medical consultations via video. It also offers health apps and services to clients such as Prudential. The company was last valued at $2 billion during a fund-raise in 2019, and has raised more than $600 million to date.
One source with knowledge of the matter said the 2019 fund-raise meant the furloughs came as a surprise. ""Everybody was surprised and thought the company should be able to sail through because most of it's app-based,"" the person said.

However, even highly valued firms with plenty of cash runway are taking steps to cut costs. UK bank startup Monzo, another highly valued firm, has offered voluntary furloughs to staff and its CEO will not take a salary for a year.
The source added that Babylon Health had expanded rapidly over the last year, saying they had seen 30 people join its London office in a single day.
The company has offices in the UK, US, Rwanda, Canada, and Singapore.
A spokesman for Babylon Health said: ""Whilst we've seen large increases in demand for our core services, there are parts of our work that have had to be paused during these extraordinary times.
""As a result, like every other company, we've had to make some difficult decisions and have placed around 5% of our employees on furlough. This includes our office facilities team, and people working on certain non-core or older technology developments. We're making additional top-up payments for lower-earning employees to try to minimise any hardship.""
Babylon Health has been prominent in the news during the pandemic, rolling out new apps and services in response to COVID-19. CEO Ali Parsa also met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March along with other healthtech startups to discuss the rollout of coronavirus testing, an increasingly painful political issue for the government.
The firm has also come under scrutiny for its behavior over the past few years. One of the firm's products, an ""AI chatbot"" which triages patients, has been repeatedly criticized by clinicians for its accuracy. When one UK clinician highlighted problems with the chatbot in September 2019, Babylon Health put out a press release describing him as a troll.
The UK's current health secretary, Matt Hancock, who is prominent in leading the country's response to the pandemic, has also been criticized for openly endorsing Babylon Health and its ""GP at Hand"" video consultation app."

Many other countries are in the same situation. This is undoubtedly good news, but its perhaps not as good as many might hope. Indeed, in his first speech after recovering from COVID-19 on Monday, the UKs Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it the moment of maximum risk.
Number deaths reported in hopsitals in England aggregated by date of death shows that we are clearly over the peak. https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/
Part of the reason he defined it as such is because the peak that the UK has passed is, in many senses, artificial a result of the stringent lockdown measures citizens have been forced to endure for the last month. This is not the same peak from the flatten the curve rhetoric of early government briefings.
The aim of flattening the curve seemed to be to allow the disease to spread through the population slowly enough that, eventually, a large proportion of people in the country would have had the disease, while the peak demand on the health service was kept at a manageable level.
If herd immunity having a sufficiently large proportion of the population that has recovered from the disease with immunity to deny the virus the fresh susceptible people it needs to propagate was not explicitly the stated aim, certainly none of the flatten-the-curve schematics acknowledged the possibility of a second peak. It seemed to be suggested that, at the end of this flatter peak, most restrictions might be lifted and life might go back to normal.
An early infographic purporting to display a flattened epidemic curve. In reality the scale of Healthcare capacity is massively overestimated.
This is not what the UK has achieved. It would have needed extremely finely calibrated interventions to slow down the infection rate to just the right degree to keep the disease in check while still allowing some transmission. Most cartoon schematics (like the one above) that illustrate flattening the curve are misleading. The peak would need to be way lower. And to imbue the population with herd immunity at such a slow rate of spread, it would also have taken far longer. A realistic comparison of the expected peak demand on UK critical care beds and the potential capacity is given in the figure below.
Critical bed capacity falls dramatically below the peak demand without intervention. Author created
Far from the inert firebreak promised by herd immunity, the vast majority of the UK population are probably still susceptible to the disease a tinder box just waiting for a spark to reignite it.
The way out
The reproduction number of the disease tells us how many people a single infectious person will infect on average at a given point in time. If the reproduction number is above one, the disease will take off. If its below one, the disease will die out as each new infectious person passes the disease to fewer than one other person on average.
The reproduction number depends on three factors: the transmissibility (how easily the disease passes between people); the infectious period (the longer it is, the more chances there are for an infectious person to pass on the disease); and the number of susceptible people in the population.
The aim in eradicating the pandemic is to alter one or more of these factors in order to bring the reproduction number permanently below one. The infectious period is largely beyond our control (certainly without effective antivirals). Transmission can be significantly reduced by the strict social distancing, quarantine and isolation rules many of us are currently subject to. We have succeeded in temporarily reducing transmission and bringing the reproduction number below one, which in turn has led to a decline in cases of COVID-19.
But for things to return to normal, the only real strategy is to bring down the number of susceptible people. This is the reason why vaccination can wipe a disease out. It effectively reduces the susceptible population. Without a vaccine, though, the only other way to derive immunity is to have the disease. For COVID-19, rough estimates suggest that we need up to 60% of the population to have had the disease to achieve herd immunity.
So although we are slowly descending from the peak of the first small ridge of the epidemic, without the large number of people gaining immunity through having the disease, the mountain metaphor is unhelpful. The laws of epidemic gravity wont help to pull us down on this descent. If the UK relaxes social distancing now, while most of the population is still susceptible, it runs the very real risk of a second wave.
A better analogy would be to the decelerating influence of a parachute. Social distancing and other measures have slowed the spread to a point at which the impact of the disease is currently manageable. But cut the parachute too early, before the danger is averted, and the outbreak will accelerate again.
The end of the beginning?
Thankfully, the peak the UK has experienced has had nowhere near the magnitude of the peak that would have hit had the virus been allowed to pass through the population unhindered. Instead, it has been brought under control and the health service has been protected. The consequence, however, is that the vast majority of the population remain susceptible.
A second wave isnt inevitable, but unless the UK can scale up its ability to test, isolate and trace contacts of infected people, putting out each new fire at source, then a significant loosening of restrictions will inevitably have to be re-tightened as cases begin to grow again.
Famously, after a significant victory against Rommels forces at El Alamein in 1942, Churchill said, in the context of the tide turning in the Allies favor during the second world war: Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
Although the UK is over the peak of the first wave, in the context of the battle against COVID-19 we still have a long way to go before we draw close the end of the beginning, let alone the beginning of the end.

The question: If doctors give therapeutic doses of the blood-thinner heparin, do those doctors save the lives of COVID-19 patients? 
Spyropoulos is an expert on blood clots at Northwell Health in New York, and he said that's the single most important question he's come across in the time he's spent in his field.
As the coronavirus pandemic has spread, infecting millions globally and killing hundreds of thousands, doctors have been forced to rapidly figure out how to treat it without a vaccine or medicines that cure it. They're still not sure of the best way to get oxygen into the damaged lungs of the most severely ill patients, for example.
And now, they're learning that the respiratory disease appears to be impacting more than just the lungs, particularly in severe cases. Doctors have reported kidney issues, heart problems, and more recently, issues with blood clots appearing in different parts of the body. Not helping the matter, researchers have also reported complications that might make it harder for people to form blood clots in other hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.
Typically, doctors like Spyropoulos prefer to rely on results from robust clinical trials to figure out whether treatments are effective. But because the virus is so new, trials are just getting started, with results expected in the coming months. 
""We're driving blindly based on what we call very weak but very compelling data,""  Spyropoulos said. 
In the absence of sturdy scientific evidence backing up whether one approach or another is best, doctors are debating the best way to treat the disease. Studies are ongoing looking into the answer to Spyropoulos's question, as well as whether clot-busting drugs — typically used to treat strokes — are a better approach.

'Remarkably high' incidence of clotting in COVID-19 patients
Early on in the coronavirus outbreak, doctors in the US were hearing from colleagues in China about the virus' effects on the heart, Dr. Thomas Maddox, who serves as chair of the science and quality committee of the American College of Cardiology, told Business Insider.
The effects seemed to be related to both a viral invasion of the heart and to the stress of fighting the respiratory disease.
With COVID-19, doctors are also seeing blood clots occurring in the lungs and bodies of patients on ventilators, Dr. Greg Martin, a professor of pulmonary critical care at Emory University and president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, told Business Insider.
Clots can wreak havoc on the body, traveling and blocking up veins, leading to strokes, heart attacks, kidney problems, lung problems, and more.

Blood clots aren't uncommon in severely ill patients in intensive care units, or even in hospitalizations. While in the ICU, patients are typically on breathing support and sedated, which limits their ability to move as they heal. Staying still raises the risk of clots.

Northwell Health's Dr. Alex Spyropoulos with a colleague.
Northwell Health
Other viruses also raise the risk of clots
But doctors have a hunch that the virus might play a role in increasing the risk of clots, too.
""We think it's one of the most important, if not the most important, issue with respect to monitoring sick hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"" Spyropoulos said.
It wouldn't be the first time, he said. Doctors noted an elevated risk of clotting in patients with H1N1, or swine flu, as well as in the SARS outbreak, another coronavirus, in the early 2000s. 
With the novel coronavirus, more clots seem to be originating in the lungs, Spyropoulos said. 
In a recent observational study, Dutch researchers looked at 184 patients in the intensive care unit with coronavirus. About a third of them had a complication associated with a clot, such as clots in the lungs, clots in the legs, stroke, heart attack, or other clots cutting off blood to other parts of the body.
All were on preventive treatment intended to prevent clotting in the body.
That's a higher rate of problems than might typically be seen in patients in intensive care units, Spyropoulos said. Typically, he said, clotting rates in ICUs for different conditions are between 5-10%. The researchers called it ""remarkably high,"" recommending increasing doses of the blood-thinning medication.
To figure out the best way to treat patients, researchers are evaluating two options:
Making decisions in the absence of evidence
For now, most of the evidence doctors are using isn't much better than anecdotes. The ACC is currently reviewing recommendations on how to take care of the clotting complications seen in COVID-19 patients, but heart doctors won't have much evidence to guide them until they get clinical trial results, likely, in the second half of this year. 
""Our journals are inundated with essentially opinion pieces,"" Maddox said. 
To preventing clotting complications in COVID-19, Northwell's Spyropoulos has been relying on his clinical experience to make decisions. 
""If you have a deep experience in this field you can make reasonable assumptions and extrapolations and observations from indirect data,"" Spyropoulos said.
For the past month — partially while out sick with COVID-19 himself — he been working with the health system to adjust guidelines, stepping up preventive dosing of blood thinners and making sure doctors are more sensitive to signals that might indicate clotting, such as swelling in the legs of patients.
The health system has also been keeping tabs on signs of clotting once patients leave the hospital and prescribing blood thinners when patients are discharged. 
Clotting complications outside the hospital in COVID-19 patients
For now, most of the conversation is about what to do with blood clot complications in hospitalized patients. 
But, Spyropoulos said, there are two additional questions he's keeping his eye on.
One is whether clotting complications are happening in milder COVID-19 cases that don't require a hospital stay. That's a question that's far from being answered, particularly given the lack of routine testing available. 
The other question is whether blood clots are causing problems after COVID-19 patients leave the hospital, leading to sudden deaths. Spyropoulos said he's concerned about complications arising after patients are discharged. In early autopsy data from Northwell, there appear to be major clotting events like a massive heart attack or lung clots in 40% of patients who have died after leaving the hospital."

The company is also advocating for legislation that would require it to provide drivers with certain financial benefits while still classifying them as independent contractors. “protections and benefits for independent workers, not just employees” The appeal comes as Uber has seen a precipitous drop in ridership as a result of the pandemic. The company’s gross bookings in Seattle, a city hit hard by the novel coronavirus, is down by 60 to 70 percent, and Uber is assuming similar declines in other big cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. The company suspended its carpooling service, UberPool, in most major markets and is providing financial assistance for drivers who have contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, or who have had their accounts suspended or been told to quarantine by public health officials. In a letter to President Donald Trump and congressional leaders on March 23rd, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said any economic stimulus should include “protections and benefits for independent workers, not just employees.” But Khosrowshahi insisted that he wasn’t seeking a handout for his company. 1/2 My request of America’s leaders: make sure @Uber drivers & delivery people, along with all independent workers in the gig economy and beyond, get immediate protection and support in COVID-19 stimulus packages https://t.co/SKBlOubxyY pic.twitter.com/U2xHPxQmyh — dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) March 23, 2020 “My goal in writing to you is not to ask for a bailout for Uber, but rather for support for the independent workers on our platform and, once we move past the immediate crisis, the opportunity to legally provide them with a real safety net going forward,” Khosrowshahi writes. Khosrowshahi avoided prescribing a specific amount of money for gig workers, but he is broadly advocating that independent contractors should be included in any bailout measures for full-time employees. Some of these measures are already under debate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), with whom Khosrowshahi spoke over the weekend, is pushing for language that would expand and increase unemployment insurance for freelancers, in addition to other protections. Sensing that the novel coronavirus could present a unique opportunity to address one of Uber’s long-standing quandaries, Khosrowshahi is also calling for legislation that would amend existing labor laws to better suit its approach to worker classification. The company is under pressure in states like California, where a recent law is making it more difficult for gig economy companies to classify workers as freelancers, to completely change its approach to employment. The company, which has hemorrhaged money since its disastrous IPO last year, is dead set against classifying drivers as employees. “The economic challenges ahead of us mean America’s workers will need more opportunities to earn additional income, not fewer,” Khosrowshahi writes. “I am eager for us to work together to establish a new standard for flexible work, so that it benefits all who choose it and continues to be readily available to as many people as possible when they and our country need it most.” “Put simply, our laws should protect all workers, not just one type of work.” He adds, “Put simply, our laws should protect all workers, not just one type of work.” Khosrowshahi says Uber is “already working with lawmakers and Governors in various jurisdictions across the U.S. on similar legislation that would require companies like ours to provide protections and benefits to our independent contractors.” Uber’s state-by-state lobbying effort is mostly to avoid a repeat of what happened in California. In the run-up to the passage of AB5 in California, the company proposed paying drivers $21 an hour (but only while on a trip), providing them with sick leave and empowering them to “have a collective voice” — a nod toward drivers forming a union. But the proposal was disregarded; on September 18th, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB5 into law. After the law was passed, Uber introduced some dramatic changes to its app in an effort to be in compliance. Now, Uber’s app displays prices differently, allows users to select preferred drivers, and discontinues some benefits associated with its driver rewards program. The company is betting that by giving drivers more control over their rides and making fares more transparent, they can avoid some of the repercussions of the law, which enshrines the so-called “ABC test” for determining whether someone is a contractor or employee. Khosrowshahi’s appeal to the Trump administration for legal support isn’t surprising given the federal government’s endorsement of Uber’s worker classification. Last year, the US Department of Labor issued an opinion stating that gig workers like Uber drivers are contractors ineligible for minimum wages and overtime pay. A federal judge ruled basically the same way in 2018 in what is said to be the first classification of Uber drivers under federal law. And more recently, the federal labor board’s general counsel said that Uber drivers are independent contractors, not employees of the ride-hailing company."

While no public health expert has a foolproof crystal ball, this scenario of repeated waves means that the likely contours of the next one to two years are now coming into clearer view.
Right now, many countries including Italy, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom, are still struggling desperately to put out the initial fire. They are using suppression measures like stay-at-home orders as a fire extinguisher to smother transmission while urgently trying to ramp up their capacity to conduct testing, to manufacture and distribute personal protective equipment for health workers, and to treat people with COVID-19.
Once countries have achieved a sharp fall in new daily cases, protected all their health workers, scaled up their hospital capacity to deal with future COVID-19 outbreaks, and can conduct widespread and efficient testing, isolation of cases, and contact tracing, they can then start relaxing their lockdowns.
But even in this best case scenario, we are likely to see further outbreaks, and we may need to turn on the fire extinguisher again.
Turning the fire extinguisher on and off will buy us time until we develop a COVID-19 vaccine. If we develop a safe and highly effective vaccine, over time we will be able to vaccinate a high enough proportion of the world’s population to eliminate the risk of overwhelming epidemics. An effective vaccine will both prevent people getting COVID-19 and also curb transmission.
The good news is that the time from “lab to jab” could be as short as 12-18 months (though some experts predict it will take longer), a fraction of the time it took to develop an Ebola vaccine. Efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines have been on the fastest trajectory in history. Just 63 days after China shared the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the first human trial began in Seattle, USA on March 16, 2020. Two days later a trial in China kicked off.
There are now at least 70 COVID-19 vaccines under development, including at my own university led by Bart Haynes at the Duke Human Vaccine Initiative. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Norway-based public-private partnership that develops epidemic vaccines, is aiming to mobilize $2 billion to make three vaccines available to the point at which they can be mass manufactured and deployed. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, just announced a $1 billion partnership with J&amp;J to accelerate development of J&amp;J’s vaccine candidate.
The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will help fund factories ready to manufacture seven of the vaccine candidates currently under development, even though only one or two candidates are likely to be successful, a strategy that Bill Gates acknowledges will lead to billions being spent on the abandoned five candidates. Losing a few billion dollars, he argues, is worth it compared to the trillions of dollars being lost economically by COVID-19.
The more vaccine development efforts there are underway, the greater the odds that a vaccine will be available in 12-18 months. Governments, philanthropies, academics, and industry should do everything they feasibly can to reduce those timelines further, if at all possible.
But there’s also bad news on the vaccine front. There’s no guarantee right now that when COVID-19 vaccines are ready, they will actually reach everyone who needs them. There’s a serious risk that rich countries will monopolize the vaccine, leaving poor countries behind. Such behavior by the rich world would not only be immoral but disastrous to their own health and recovery too, and the selfishness would upend our global efforts to shut down the pandemic once and for all.
We’ve seen this happen before. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, rich countries like Australia, Canada, and the United States secured large advanced orders for the vaccine from manufacturers, and as a result poor countries received vaccines much more slowly and in smaller quantities. They were unable to vaccinate as many of their citizens.
And we’ve already seen recent signs of monopoly behavior by the rich. The Trump Administration reportedly tried to buy the German firm CureVac, which is developing a COVID-19 vaccine—a New York Times story said that the attempted purchased raised “fears in Berlin that President Trump was trying to assure that any inoculation would be available first, and perhaps exclusively, in the United States.” A researcher at the University of Copenhagen who is developing a vaccine with public funding from the European Union has been approached with large financial offers from companies wanting to buy the rights to his research. And rich countries are trying to monopolize other vital supplies, including face masks and critical medicines that are used to treat patients in intensive care, like antibiotics, blood pressure drugs, and sedatives.
We need to put a plan in place to make sure that everyone worldwide who needs the vaccine will be able to receive it, free at the point of care. What would such a plan look like?
Based on typical vaccine development success rates, it is reasonable to assume that at least one or two vaccines currently under development will prove to be safe and effective in large randomized controlled trials. Manufacturing capacity will need to be built worldwide so that the vaccine can be produced in bulk quantities. For this to happen, companies that know how to make COVID-19 vaccines will need to widely share their knowledge. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called on “all countries, companies and research institutions to support open data, open science, and open collaboration so that all people can enjoy the benefits of science and research,” including by voluntarily sharing intellectual property on COVID-19 medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics.
Let’s assume, optimistically, that a billion doses of vaccine—whether from one or more vaccine producers—will be ready for use in 2021. Governments worldwide should club together into a “solidarity purchasing club” to make a large advanced purchase commitment, with countries contributing according to their means, to buy these billion doses and fund their distribution for prioritized populations worldwide. The vaccine should then be made free to recipients at the point of care and accessible just like your typical flu shot.
For this to happen, we’ll need vaccine manufacturers based in rich and poor countries to work in partnership with each other. No sole manufacturer on earth will be able to single-handedly make enough vaccine. The manufacturing of any successful vaccine will need to be globalized as quickly as possible. All vaccine developers receiving public funds must be prepared to support the necessary technology transfer arrangements to manufacturers worldwide.
We’ll then need a worldwide allocation system that is fair, transparent, and tailored towards ending the pandemic. It would make sense, for example, for the initial doses to go first to health workers and to countries that have an uncontrolled epidemic, then to the elderly and medically vulnerable, and finally to the whole population.
The Geneva-based organization Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which currently funds vaccinations in 73 low- and middle-income countries, is already helping to get these countries ready for the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. With sufficient donations from the public, philanthropic, and private sectors, Gavi could buy enough vaccine for all 73 countries. Other funders like the World Bank and the Global Fund will need to help fund vaccine delivery efforts.
Which brings us to the multi-billion dollar question. How much cash will be needed to buy enough vaccine? This all depends on the price of the vaccine.
In the current pandemic situation, many vaccine companies are receiving public funding for their efforts and should not be seeking a profit or price gouging. We cannot expect them to take a big financial hit, of course, but they should ideally sell the vaccine on a break-even basis. The manufacturers should commit to making the vaccine available at a price low enough to ensure truly global reach.
Given J&amp;J’s important partnership with BARDA, the company looks set to potentially be a key supplier of a vaccine. It was therefore encouraging to learn that if J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine effort is successful, the company will sell it on a not-for-profit basis. But the price that J&amp;J is suggesting, of ten dollars a dose, would mean that the solidarity purchasing club would simply not be able to buy enough doses to distribute the vaccine to those who need it worldwide. Ten dollars would be just the price of the vaccine itself—there is an additional cost for the distribution. At a ten dollars per dose price, there would probably be no end in sight for the COVID-19 crisis.
Nobody can know so early in the development process what the final price of a new vaccine will be. It depends on many factors, such as how it is given (e.g. the number of doses), the complexity of the manufacturing process, and whether you need to add an ingredient called an adjuvant to boost the vaccine’s effectiveness. But when the world finally gets a safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine, fair allocation and fair pricing will be crucial for ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

In less than two weeks, he has had to learn about a fast-spreading, complicated viral outbreak and take control of the entire federal government response to it. “Everything comes to Pence” on COVID-19, a White House official says, and “he’s coming up to speed from zero.”
That, for some, is cause to worry. For starters, President Donald Trump and his administration have gone further than recent American leaders to insert politics into once-shielded areas of government, from the Federal Reserve and foreign policy to homeland security and the courts. Even if Pence can resist the pressure to play politics with COVID-19, administration critics say, it’s not clear the Vice President has what it takes to lead the fight against a fast-moving epidemic that potentially threatens thousands of lives.
“There’s always a concern in an election year about the role politics plays in public policy,” says presidential historian Timothy Naftali. But the larger concern “is just incompetence,” Naftali says. “There is an understaffed government that hasn’t shown respect for expertise, scientific or otherwise. Right now, what the American people need is expertise.”
Trump hasn’t made matters any easier. Pence is in the unenviable position of having to convince the public he is listening to the best medical advice, while the President supplants evidence with gut instinct. Trump has repeatedly downplayed the danger posed by COVID-19 and its expected spread in the U.S., occasionally contradicting his own and other medical experts.
In a recent example, Wednesday night on Fox News, Trump said that thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of people get better from COVID-19 “just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tells employers to encourage sick employees to stay home. Speaking to reporters during a primetime press conference on Feb. 26, Trump said, speaking about COVID-19 cases, “we’re going down, not up.” Within minutes, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the CDC, said health officials “do expect more cases.” During a March 2 White House meeting with pharmaceutical company executives, Trump said a vaccine could be ready in “months” and he’s “heard very quick numbers.” Trump’s head of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, spoke up, saying a vaccine could be ready in a year to a year-and-a-half “at the earliest,” adding: “Like I’ve been telling you, Mr. President.” 
Such conflicting public messaging can be dangerous in a crisis and was precisely the problem Pence was nominally brought in to fix. On Feb. 25, senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier roiled markets when she said COVID-19’s spread in the U.S. was “not a question of if but rather a question of when” and that the public should prepare. That same day Trump’s top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said on CNBC that the virus had been contained, there would be little economic fallout in the U.S., and the U.S. response was “pretty close to air-tight.” Kudlow felt blindsided by the CDC’s evaluation, a White House official says.
The mixed messages sparked a wave of criticism and Trump, returning from a visit to India, was furious at the growing perception that his administration didn’t have a handle on the outbreak. A day later, Trump brought in Pence to harmonize the administration’s messaging on the virus and to be a senior voice corralling multiple agencies to prepare and respond. In the process, Trump shunted aside the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, a former drug company executive and lobbyist with extensive government experience who had been leading the effort.
Pence served as the governor of Indiana from 2013 until 2017 and oversaw the state’s response to the first U.S. case of MERS-CoV, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a different type of coronavirus. White House aides believe that Pence’s experience as a governor will help him talk to regional leaders and orchestrate aid for state and local responses. But while he was Indiana governor, he also presided over budget cuts to local health and testing facilities that critics blamed for an uptick in HIV among intravenous drug users. “Right now he’s kind of the vice president without any meaningful portfolio, one of the least memorable and least effective vice presidents,” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, adding: “He’s in the Dan Quayle club of meaningless VPs.” 
So far, Pence’s strategy on COVID-19 has entailed a mix of inter-agency meetings, personnel moves and PR. In the week since Pence took over the federal response, he absorbed onto his team Deborah Birx, a respected public health expert brought to the White House from the State Department with a Rolodex full of health leaders around the world. He’s shuttled between meetings with health care and pharmaceutical executives in the West Wing and convened larger meetings at his office across an alley on the second floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. And he’s made himself the face of the response, placing the Vice Presidential seal on the lectern in the White House briefing room during press conferences.
He’s convened meetings with long-term care providers, diagnostic lab companies, and airline CEOs to coordinate the response to the virus. “It’s safe to fly in America,” Pence told reporters after meeting with airline executives, even as health experts emphasize that viruses can be more readily transmitted on passengers airplanes. On Thursday, Pence flew to Maplewood, Minn. to 3M headquarters to talk about increasing face mask production for health care workers, and emphasized that the general public doesn’t need the masks.
Overall, Pence has received mixed to positive reviews from regional and other leaders, including Democrats. Pence visited Washington State on Thursday to talk to local leaders about the spike in COVID-19 infections in the Seattle area. During the visit, Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington State, who had tweeted last week that the Trump administration should “stick to science and tell the truth,” told reporters that he was getting good information from the federal government. Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland gave Pence similarly positive reviews after he and an interagency team briefed Senators earlier in the week.
Messaging problems remain. On March 3, Pence had told reporters that the Trump administration was addressing the COVID-19 test kit shortage and had lifted restrictions on who could be tested with the limited supply. “Any American can be tested,” Pence had said, saying there would be “no restrictions, subject to doctors’ orders.” But without many labs or test kits available, the number of patients that should be referred for testing is still relatively small, Pence told reporters on Thursday. “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,” Pence said. According to the CDC, clinicians should “use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested.”
Pence has a fair amount at stake in whether such measures work. He has been handed a national crisis and his success or failure could define the Trump Presidency—as well as his own future. He’s got the spotlight, but he’ll own the disaster if the outbreak is handled badly. “It is a high risk game for Pence because he’s operating on a superhighway with angry citizens and he very easily could become debris,” says the historian Brinkley. In an election year, with a particularly unforgiving boss, that’s a dangerous spot to be in. But not nearly as dangerous a spot as that of the thousands of Americans who may live or die on the competence of Pence’s performance.

New York City has rapidly become a hotspot for COVID-19, with more than 15,000 of the world’s roughly 440,000 cases as of the morning of March 25. Doctors and nurses have been working around the clock to care for the surge of patients, canceling elective procedures and non-urgent appointments to free up bed space, protective supplies and staffing for acutely ill patients.
NYU’s action aims to add more physicians to the ranks.
“In response to the growing spread of COVID-19, and in response to Governor Cuomo’s directive to get more physicians into the health system more quickly, NYU Grossman School of Medicine and NYU have agreed to permit early graduation for its medical students,” an NYU spokesperson confirmed to TIME. The decision is subject to approval by the New York State Department of Education, Middle States and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.
According to an email circulating on Twitter, the option is available to students in NYU’s class of 2020 who have met all graduation requirements and volunteer to work in the NYU hospital system’s internal or emergency medicine departments beginning in April.
NYU’s decision is just one example of COVID-19’s shakeup to medical education. “Match Day,” when graduating medical students learn where they will complete their residency training, is typically a ceremonious occasion, when classes gather to announce their matches. But this year, with most mass gatherings canceled due to the outbreak, Match Day was a remote affair for students like John Damianos, who learned by email, surrounded by family at home, that he will leave Dartmouth University’s Geisel School of Medicine to start an internal medicine residency at Yale University this summer.
“Many people are more excited about Match Day than even graduation,” Damianos says. “It was not the Match Day we expected, but we all understood the important need for canceling it.”
Now, Damianos and his colleagues are readying themselves to potentially enter the workforce earlier than expected, and under highly uncertain conditions. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center has leaned on medical students to carry out a number of support roles during the pandemic, and hospitals around the country have done likewise. Health care students in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, for example, have developed a childcare network for workers on the front lines.
Damianos, at least, says he’s ready to jump into patient care whenever the call comes.
“This is why I went into medicine: to help people, to serve as an advocate for public health,” he says. “This is it. This is the time to rise to the calling.”

When in-person races were canceled this year, NASCAR and Fox Sports announced the first-ever eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series, a simulation-style competition featuring stars like Dale Earnhardt Jr., Bobby Labonte, Kyle Busch and Denny Hamlin racing in digital vehicles. It was the first time many NASCAR fans -- and drivers -- were exposed to the magic of professional gaming.
The inaugural eNASCAR race aired on March 22nd and it was the highest-rated televised esports program to date, drawing in 903,000 viewers. It was also the most-watched sports broadcast that Sunday, and the most-watched program on its host channel, FS1, since most sports events were canceled on March 12th. The following race on March 30th clocked 1.33 million viewers, breaking the previous Sunday's record.
Torque Esports is running The Race All-Stars Esports Battle, an online event serving Formula 1, IndyCar, Formula E, NASCAR and other audiences in the wake of mass event cancelations. This event has already attracted new advertising partners including its first corporate sponsor, Jones Soda.

""Our goal, and this goes for streaming numbers and fan interest as well, is that the current situation doesn't become just a blip on the radar.

This interest isn't limited to the racing genre. Vice President of Overwatch Esports at Blizzard Entertainment Jon Spector said, ""We are seeing an increased interest in gaming, streaming and esports overall,"" while LCS head Greeley said, ""We're seeing excitement in partnership discussions.""
Greeley noted that in 2019, Nielsen ranked the LCS as the third-most popular professional sports league in the US among 18- to 34-year-olds. This is a coveted market for advertisers, and a sign that esports were already on the radar of major sponsors. The coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated their involvement.
""We see this activity more as a continuation of sponsorship trends than a big change, since the esports ecosystem and leagues like LCS have been gaining momentum for some time now in global media,"" Greeley said. ""Sponsors are drawn to the size and passion of the esports community, and we believe that's only going to continue growing from here.""
Torque Esports' analytics group, Stream Hatchet, says esports streaming viewership has grown more than 17 percent from January to March this year, with 1.75 billion minutes of content watched around the world in March alone. A 12-hour Stream Aid Charity Marathon on Twitch last Saturday raised $2.8 million for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.
""We're introducing esports to a much wider audience, particularly in the motorsports genre,"" Cox said. ""The 'stay at home economy' is something that is expanding rapidly and our live-streaming data analytics team at Stream Hatchet is certainly seeing dramatic increases in all platforms at the moment.""
Of course, the global pandemic has disrupted the esports world, too. Established leagues like the LCS and OWL have the resources to quickly pivot and implement online-only tournaments, and sponsors are already knocking. However, newer leagues might find it harder to catch their footing. For instance, the Apex Legends pro scene kicked off this year and was already struggling with server issues, a lack of advertising and poor management structures before the outbreak began. Organizers announced yesterday they would move the remainder of the Apex Legends Global Series online, with the finals airing on Twitch and YouTube on April 6th. It's a rough first year for any league.
Even established organizations are feeling the pressure: Chaos Esports Club let go its entire Dota 2 squad following the suspension of the Dota Pro Circuit this year.
""This is not a decision we made lightly, but during these uncertain times and with the DPC circuit suspended it is impossible for us to justify the cost of a Dota 2 team at this time,"" Chaos Esports Club CEO Greg Laird said at the time. ""The world is an unprecedented situation and it is necessary for us to focus our efforts into a few key current and upcoming projects for the long-term success of the organization.""
Today we unfortunately have to announce the release of our Dota 2 Roster.

Compared with many other industries, esports have experienced low job loss during the global pandemic, largely because leagues are able to transition online instead of shutting down altogether. Unemployment rates in the US are expected to hit their highest point since World War II, with conservative estimates projecting 20 million Americans will lose their job in the next few weeks.
Esports are well-positioned to serve an audience that's trapped at home, and organizers are doing everything they can to capitalize on this strange new market. The trick, they say, is making all of this progress stick even after the pandemic has ended.
""We're very interested in using this as the foundation for long-term growth,"" Cox said. ""Esports as a whole has been growing dramatically in recent years and now we're in a massive spike. Once traditional sport returns we're obviously going to see a levelling off. But in five years' time we want to look back on today as not just 'the COVID-19 esports thing,' but as a tipping point for when esports took its first steps into the mainstream and cemented its place alongside other professional sports."""

Stanford Universitys Folding@home distributed computing project is seeking volunteers to help researchers develop treatment therapies for the novel coronavirus. 
Folding@home (FAH) uses the processing capacity of networked computers to simulate the complex process of protein folding, which helps determine how to treat diseases like Alzheimers and cancer, and SARS, another coronavirus. A brief explainer from Folding@home:
For both coronaviruses [the current 2019 nCoV and SARS], the first step of infection occurs in the lungs, when a protein on the surface of the virus binds to a receptor protein on a lung cell. This viral protein is called the spike protein ... Proteins are not stagnantthey wiggle and fold and unfold to take on numerous shapes. We need to study not only one shape of the viral spike protein, but all the ways the protein wiggles and folds into alternative shapes
Studying how the protein folds could eventually help researchers develop drugs that could treat infections of the virus. 
This kind of research requires substantial computational power, which FAH generates by tapping into volunteers CPUs when theyre idle.

Apple has informed its tech support retail employees that stock of replacement iPhones will be strained for the next few weeks, according to Apple Store employees who spoke with Bloomberg. This shortage marks one of the first instances of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and its many ripple effects on industries worldwide, affecting the iPhone makers existing product supply. Bloomberg notes that the companys iPhone 11 and iPad Pro lines are beginning to see shortages as well. 
The company shared in a recent investor call that it does not expect to meet revenue goals for the second fiscal quarter of 2020, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has also said worldwide iPhone supply would be temporarily constrained. But it wasnt clear at the time that the effects of the coronavirus would hit existing products like replacement iPhones, too. 
Some Apple Store locations are short on individual parts, too
If your iPhone is heavily damaged to the point of needing to be replaced there will reportedly be a limited supply of replacement devices to swap it out for over the course of the next two to four weeks. The report also notes that some Apple Store locations are short on individual parts, meaning that in those cases, minor repairs that are normally handled in-store may not be possible due to shortages. 
This doesnt mean youre without any options if your iPhone isnt working. Bloomberg says a memo from Apple told employees that stores are authorized to mail replacement iPhones to customers whenever they become available, or loan out iPhones until a replacement arrives.
Bloomberg notes that Apple has reopened most of the China-based Apple Stores that have closed due to the COVID-19 virus. That could be a sign that other parts of Apples business may soon function normally. Also, that Apple expects the shortage to last for up to four weeks could mean its already ramping up the restocking of replacement phones in the meantime.

New customers signing up for Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods Market home delivery will now need to make it through a waitlist before they can order groceries. Amazon announced the new procedure yesterday, adding that the company is increasing capacity each week and will invite new customers to shop every week. Select Whole Foods locations will have store hours adjusted to focus exclusively on fulfilling online grocery orders during this time, and Amazon notes that its own full-fledged grocery store is now open in Woodland Hills, California, but is solely focused on online orders and delivery for now. 
Delivery windows for Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market have been increasingly difficult to secure during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Amazon says its coming up with a system that should at least bring more order to the situation. 
In the coming weeks, we will launch a new feature that will allow customers to secure time to shop, the company said in a blog post. This feature will give delivery customers a virtual place in line and will allow us to distribute the delivery windows on a first come, first served basis. Amazon acknowledges that despite its continued efforts to add more capacity, customers will still likely have a tough time finding a delivery window. Its at least trying to make available slots more visible by putting that information right on the Amazon Fresh homepage. 
Amazon hired 100,000 workers in four weeks
In a separate update this morning, Amazon announced it has already hired the 100,000 workers it pledged to bring on last month to help meet customer demand. Today, we are proud to announce that our original 100,000 jobs pledge is filled and those new employees are working at sites across the US helping to serve customers. 
Now, Amazon claims it will hire another 75,000 people during this unprecedented time.
We know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants, and travel are lost or furloughed as part of this crisis and we welcome anyone out of work to join us at Amazon until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back. 
Amazon also said that it expects to spend $500 million (instead of the $350 million originally stated) on pay increases for the employees putting themselves at risk to get food and other essential items out to millions of people. Amazons main online store continues to prioritize speedy delivery of household items, with shipping timeframes for most other products extended into May at this point."

One of the biggest complaints Disney Plus received at launch was The Simpsons not being available to stream in the correct 4:3 ratio. Disney has worked on a solution, and the company is hoping subscribers will be able to stream the show in its proper format by the end of May. 
We appreciate our fans patience and are working to make the first 19 Seasons (and part of 20) of The Simpsons available in 4:3 versions on Disney Plus, a tweet from the company reads. We expect to accomplish this by the end of May. 
Instead of being available to stream in a 4:3 ratio, Disney Plus released episodes formatted for a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, which crops out many visual gags entirely. The company said in November that it chose to release the episodes in a 16:9 aspect ratio in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons. In doing so, the quality might be better, but the jokes dont land as well. 
All the classic Simpsons episodes on Disney+ are in cropped widescreen format -- this means you miss out on tons of great visual jokes, like how Duff, Duff Lite and Duff Dry all come from the same tube. pic.twitter.com/cTy9adulFl
 Tristan Cooper (@TristanACooper) November 12, 2019
When The Simpsons premiered in 1989, it was in a 4:3 ratio. The switch didnt occur until the end of 2009, about a third of the way through The Simpsons 20th season, when the shows aspect ratio switched from 4:3 to 16:9. Its been an ongoing issue that has even developed into a meme among Simpsons fans. The situation improved a bit in 2015, though, when Foxs FXX network announced that early Simpsons episodes would be available to stream in a 4:3 ratio on the Simpsons World app.
The move got FXX a ton of praise, with fans thanking the network for giving subscribers more technological freedom. Many assumed the same setup would apply to Disney Plus following the companys announcement in early 2019 that all 30 seasons would live exclusively on Disneys streaming service. When it didnt turn out to be true, fans were livid. Even former Simpsons writer Bill Oakley expressed disappointment with the setup, telling Digital Trends in November, Hopefully that will get rectified very quickly. 
Now, it looks like things are well on their way to being fixed. Of course, with the state of the world and production issues popping up because of people self-quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic, theres always a chance the format switch might get delayed."

Grimes recently released a new music video for Youll Miss Me When Im Not Around, and it came with a surprise: a content dump containing assets from her new album Miss Anthropocene and an invitation for anyone to remix the song or video.
The music video features Grimes in front of a green screen and was originally shot so her team could create visuals for the album. Now, its an opportunity for collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because were all in lockdown, she wrote on Instagram, we thought if people are bored and wanna learn new things, we could release the raw components of one of these for anyone who wants to try making stuff using our footage.
The file, called Grimes Art Kit, contains instructions for downloading all the different assets for Youll Miss Me When Im Not Around. It contains the lyrics, artwork, fonts, Native Instruments tools, video footage in 1080p and 4K, and all of the songs stems separated pieces of audio including guitar, effects, the synths, and three layers of vocals. She says her team is working on securing free short-term access to the visual tools they use for those who dont own pro editing software.
Youre free to tinker with the song and video however you like, but if you post it online, there are some rules. It cant be monetized, so YouTube and SoundCloud are the only approved platforms. And any remix of the song thats posted belongs to the label, not you. Also, make sure your YouTube upload has Youll Miss Me When Im Not Around in the title and includes #GrimesArtKit in the description. Grimes team says this will ensure that all uploads using the songs assets will get approved.
Having this sort of carte blanche access to remix a major artists content is a unique opportunity. Rights around a songs ownership can be complicated and messy, and frustrations with platform algorithms taking down legitimate content is a longstanding gripe for many creators.
Grimes will be sharing some of her favorites, so if youd like a chance at having your work reposted, tag her when you share on Twitter or Instagram and use the #GrimesArtKit hashtag.

NASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using modified Copernicus Sentinel 5P data processed by the European Space Agency. 
Theres been a dramatic drop in pollution across China as the country tries to contain COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. New maps using data collected from NASA and European Space Agency satellites show how nitrogen dioxide, a dangerous gas released by burning fuel, has dissipated since the outbreak. 
Maps depicting nitrogen dioxide levels in Wuhan, China from January 1st through February 25th of last year show the region blanketed in fiery colors, with parts in a deeper red signifying high concentrations of the pollutant. Fast forward to this year, and maps of the same region show a stark difference: theyre nearly all blue, showing lower concentrations. 
Even though pollution typically drops during that time period as the country celebrates the Lunar New Year, scientists say what theyre seeing this year is a stark difference. This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event, Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. The steep fall in emissions happened more rapidly than what she observed during the 2008 economic recession, and is also lingering longer than the drop in pollution in Beijing during the Olympics that year. I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize spread of the virus, Liu said. 
The new coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan in December. By January, officials had quarantined the city halting planes, trains, subways, and most private vehicles. As the virus spread beyond Wuhan, so did quarantines that shut down businesses, stopped travel, and curbed emissions. A map of the country before the quarantines (from January 1st to 20th) is covered with orange and red splotches, while those splotches are noticeably absent in another map depicting China after quarantines were put in place (from February 10th to 25th).
The cleaner air will hopefully provide some relief as China copes with a novel coronavirus that affects the lungs. On its own, nitrogen dioxide can inflame airways and make it harder for people to breathe. It also reacts with other chemicals to create soot, smog, and acid rain.

Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images
After it initially made restaurants participating in a discount program foot the bill, Grubhub on Thursday said it would be changing the program to cover the discount for up to 25 orders per restaurant. 
Grubhubs Supper for Support promotion offers diners $10 off an order of $30 or more placed via Grubhub between 5 and 9PM during the month of April. Under the original terms of the deal, however, restaurants that opted in were expected to cover both the $10 discount and Grubhubs commission on the undiscounted order total, not the lower amount the customer actually paid. 
After withering criticism and backlash for a promotion which appeared to take advantage of struggling restaurants, Grubhub said Thursday its putting $30 million toward Support for Supper, giving each participating restaurant a measly $250 to cover the cost of the per-order discount. After that $250 is spent, it appears the restaurants are once again on the hook to make up the difference. 
Grubhub spokesperson Dan Abernethy said in an email to The Verge that participating restaurants decide upfront whether they want to fund the additional discounts, which he said was clearly communicated to them. He added that like all Grubhub promotions, commissions are calculated on the pre-promotion total.
Abernethy said that there had been some confusion about Support for Supper which he said was an entirely optional initiative to drive more business to restaurants, that had been so successful that Grubhub was doubling down on the promotion.
Grubhub, which reported revenue of $341 million and gross food sales of $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, says it anticipates the funding for the Support for Supper promotion will help generate at least $100 million in restaurant sales. It claims that restaurants participating in its promotions during the COVID-19 pandemic have seen up to a 30 percent increase in sales. More people are ordering delivery from restaurants, many of which are closed due to social-distancing restrictions. A report from restaurant review platform Yelp estimates that restaurant delivery was up 300 percent in the past month."

Foxconns Wisconsin plant, the controversial recipient of billions of dollars in tax subsidies and the focus of multipleVergeinvestigations, will produce ventilators with medical device firm Medtronic. The partnership was announced by Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak in an interview with CNBC, who said that Foxconn will be manufacturing ventilators based on its PB-560 design in the next four to six weeks. 
Foxconns Wisconsin plant was first announced way back in 2017 as a $10 billion LCD factory. It was labeled the eighth wonder of the world by President Trump, but Foxconns plans for the site appear to have changed repeatedly over the years. At various points, Foxconn has said that it would build a smaller LCD factory, no factory at all, or that it would produce other items like a robot coffee kiosk. Now, it appears the factory will, in part at least, produce ventilators, after its planned opening next month.
Based on Medtronics open source ventilator design
Medtronics CEO was unable to share the numbers of ventilators that Foxconn will produce during his interview with CBNC. However, in a statement provided to Reuters, Foxconn said that its hoping to speed up production time so that the ventilators can be produced as soon as possible, and that medical and technical personnel from the two companies were working closely together. The partnership came about after Medtronic open-sourced the design for its PB-560 ventilator, which has been downloaded 70,000 times, according to Ishrak.
Foxconn isnt the only company rushing to produce ventilators in the face of a shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tesla is producing a sub-component of Medtronics PB-980 ventilator, and is also working on a ventilator design of its own constructed using its car components. Meanwhile Ford and General Motors have also announced plans to help with ventilator production, with Ford hoping to produce around 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days in Michigan, Reuters notes. Even British vacuum manufacturer Dyson has won a contract to produce 10,000 ventilators for the UK government.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge John Broomes in Wichita prevents the enforcement of an order issued by Gov. Laura Kelly if pastors and congregations observe social distancing. The judge’s decision will remain in effect until May 2; he has a hearing scheduled Thursday in a lawsuit filed against Kelly by two churches and their pastors.
Kelly continued to defend her order in a statement: “This is not about religion. This is about a public health crisis.”
Broomes’ action comes amid strong criticism of the Democratic governor’s order from the Republican-controlled Legislature and increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers to lift at least part of a stay-at-home order for all 2.9 million Kansas residents that took effect March 30 and is set to continue until May 3.
“Churches and religious activities appear to have been singled out among essential functions for stricter treatment,” Broomes wrote in his order.
COVID-19-related deaths rose Saturday by two, to 86, and confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 85 to 1,790. Kelly’s office said six deaths and 80 cases are tied to religious gatherings.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.
The lawsuit over church gatherings was filed Thursday by First Baptist Church in Dodge City and Pastor Stephen Ormond and Calvary Baptist Church in Junction City and Pastor Aaron Harris. The lawsuit said both churches held indoor Easter services with 20 or more members of the congregation present.
Broomes’ order does not let the churches have services without any restrictions. Instead, he ordered them to abide by recommendations for social distancing that people stay 6 feet apart and to continue following other practices the lawsuit said they had imposed, such as not using collection plates.
“Public safety is important, but so is following the Constitution,” said Tyson Langhofer, senior counsel for the Christian-founded and conservative Alliance for Defending Freedom, which was involved in the case. “We can prioritize the health of safety of ourselves and our neighbors without harming churches and people of faith.”
Kelly’s order limited in-person religious services or activities to 10 congregation members but didn’t limit the number of pastors, choir members and others who could put on the service, so long as they practiced social distancing. Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican, warned that it would be unconstitutional to cite or fine churches and pastors for violating Kelly’s order.
“Ultimately, the people were forced to stop her,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said in a statement.
Many Kansas churches have moved services online, but the pastors and churches suing Kelly said they believe God calls them to engage in “corporate” prayer.
They argued Kelly could have imposed less restrictive measures on churches to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. They also said that Kelly’s stay-at-home order had exceptions for numerous “essential” businesses, so her policies unfairly targeted and showed “hostility” toward churches.
Broomes noted the exceptions for some businesses, calling the different treatment of churches “arbitrary.”
But Kelly called the judge’s decision “preliminary” and some critics said it could be applied to only the two churches that sued.
“There is still a long way to go in this case,” Kelly said. “And we will continue to be proactive and err on the side of caution where Kansans’ health and safety is at stake,” Kelly said.
Top Republican legislative leaders moved last week to revoke Kelly’s order on church gatherings themselves, only to see the Democratic governor thwart their efforts by contesting their action before the Kansas Supreme Court. The state’s highest court let her order stand on technical grounds, without deciding whether it violated freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. or Kansas constitutions.
Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a Kansas City-area Republican, texted that people need to stay home, but, “the state cannot and should not set up a double standard.”

It was “a stroke of good luck.”
Now, his trip inside the virus-free bubble that the Costa Deliziosa cruise ship became on its 15-week odyssey is coming to an end. The boat is steaming toward Barcelona, Spain, where it will make its first port-of-call on Monday after 35 days of continuous sailing with no human contact with the outside world.
“It was not surreal. It was incredible,” Payá told The Associated Press by text messages on Saturday evening. ¨We have family in our home countries. The news that was arriving from home was causing us all a lot of worry and grief. For us, it was a stroke of good luck to be where we were.”
The 58-year-old Payá, a sports writer travelling with his wife, said when news started to reach the boat of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in their native Spain, their first desire was to get home to their two grown children in their hometown of Valencia.
But with ports denying the boat entry, they have had to temper their concern with the amenities on board.
Unlike other cruise ships that suffered outbreaks and and were often put in quarantine to protect port cities, the Deliziosa has found no cases of the COVID-19 virus, according to its owner, Italian cruise company Costa Crociere. So the boat’s 1,831 passengers were free to use the ship’s facilities and entertainments.
Payá said that the ship, which set sail from Venice in early January, stopped making ports of call after leaving western Australia last month. Overall, he praised the ship’s captain and crew for their care.
He said the passengers’ last chance to touch land was in Perth, where they docked after “70 wonderful days” of crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. That was when the U.N. World Health Organization alerted the pandemic in March. From that point on, the ship made only technical and refueling stops, before the journey back toward the Mediterranean, which took it through the Suez Canal.
“Of course, for those of us who have children in Spain, we would have preferred to return,” Payá said. “Other passengers, on the other hand, given their old age wanted to stay on board knowing that the boat was safe and secure.”
A company spokesman said a passenger left the ship earlier in the week in Marsala, Sicily, for health issues and had a COVID-19 test, which was negative. Costa said the passengers were confined to their cabins only for the period until the ship heard back that the ill guest who got off in Sicily had tested negative. It didn’t say how long that period lasted.
The Deliziosa, a nearly 300-meter (1,000-foot) vessel, will disembark 168 Spanish passengers on Monday at Barcelona’s port. Then the Deliziosa will head to its final destination, Genoa, Italy, where it is expected to let off the remaining passengers, Italians and those of other nationalities, on Wednesday. The Deliziosa was originally due to return to Venice on April 26.
French authorities had rebuffed a request by Costa for permission to disembark several hundred passengers from France and nearby countries at Marseilles. “The health situation on board the ships, with 1,814 guests and 898 members of the crew, doesn’t present any problem for public health and no case of COVID-19,” Costa’s statement said.
While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.
Passenger Jean-Pierre Escarras, from Marseilles, shot a video of their cabin that their daughters shared on social networks, in which he says: “This is our place of confinement. We are lucky to have a window.”
The couple said after a stop in Sydney, the ship’s activities were “reduced or sometimes canceled. We haven’t been able to get out on land since March 14 – that’s 34 days.”
Passengers said ports in Oman, along the Suez Canal, as well as in the Seychelles and Indian Ocean ports, refused to let the ship dock.
The company said, because the ship is Italian-flagged, it followed Italian precautionary measures in the pandemic, including social distancing between guests, limiting the number of people who could enter food areas at any one time, and transmitting entertainment to cabin TV sets.
A French woman whose in-laws are aboard the Deliziosa garnered about 100 signatures on an online petition to urge the French government to intervene to get them home.
The regional administration for Bouches-du-Rhone in southern France cited a nationwide ban on allowing foreign cruise ships to dock, as part of France’s virus confinement measures. Italy has also barred foreign cruise ships as it battles the virus outbreak.
The French administration granted exemptions to six other cruise ships in recent weeks to allow French passengers to get off, but refused this time, saying the previous stops overstretched local police and health authorities already mobilized to fight France’s severe virus crisis.
Last month, two other Costa cruise ships pulled into Italian ports, including one that earlier had passengers who tested positive for COVID-19 before being disembarked in France.
It is unclear if or where the passengers who were due to finally step on land after weeks of sailing aboard the Deliziosa would be quarantined.
What is clear is that Payá and the other passengers are returning to a new reality of home confinement, face masks and worry.
“The return home will mean a radical change, a brutal one,” Payá said on Sunday after packing his bags before spending his last night on the Deliziosa. “Fear is what made many passengers want to stay on board. But it is something that we must face, just as our families, friends, and neighbors already have.”

In a statement released Tuesday, a team of WHO experts who had assessed the country’s response to the pandemic said the country “needs to introduce community-wide steps to increase physical distancing,” postpone “large gatherings, including sports, religious and cultural events,” introduce options “for teleworking, and distance learning for schools, universities and other educational institutions” and suspend nonessential business.”
Belarus has registered 6,264 coronavirus cases and 51 deaths and remains one of the few countries affected by the pandemic that hasn’t gone into lockdown or imposed restrictions on public life in order to halt the spread of the virus. Factories, stores and restaurants conduct business as usual in Belarus, stands at sports events are filled with spectators and masks are a rare sight in the capital of Minsk.
President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled the ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist for more than two decades, has repeatedly dismissed concerns about the pandemic as “coronapsychosis.” On Monday, he allowed the country’s schools to reopen after an extended spring break. On Sunday, he attended an Easter church service with his 15-year-old son.
The government has also refused to evacuate its stranded citizens from abroad unless they pay the air fare and cover state costs of organizing flights. Several thousands of Belarusians are currently stuck abroad, unable to return home amid worldwide closure of border and flight halts.

The Results Paint a Bleak Picture for the U.S. Prison System,"2,400 inmates in Ohio have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since mass testing began. What does this mean for the U.S. prison population?",https://time.com/5825030/ohio-mass-testing-prisons-coronavirus-outbreaks/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ohio-mass-testing-COVID-19.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-04-22T20:25:30Z,"Mass testing at a state prison in Ohio has provided more evidence of just how quickly and easily the novel coronavirus can spread in correctional facilities. 1,828 people — or 73% of all inmates — have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Marion Correctional Institute in Marion County, Ohio, according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation &amp; Corrections.
At least 2,400 inmates across Ohio state prison facilities have received positive diagnoses for COVID-19 since Ohio Department of Rehabilitation &amp; Correction began testing on April 11, including large numbers at the state’s Pickaway Correctional Institution and Franklin Medical Center. As of April 22, incarcerated people make up 20% of the state’s entire coronavirus cases. No inmates have died.
This percentage is largely believed to be because mass testing has been implemented at the three facilities, based on the demographics of their populations (which skew towards elderly inmates and those with pre-existing conditions).
“We are getting positive test results on individuals who otherwise would have never been tested because they were asymptomatic,” the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation &amp; Correction said in a statement. “The total tested and total pending are part of the large mass testing currently underway.”

Mass testing at the Cummins Unit correctional facility in Lincoln County, Ark. has similarly found 731 inmates testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. (Over 1,000 inmates there have been tested, the Associated Pressreported.)
“Until we have completely interrupted chains of transmission in the prison, I’m not going to say it’s over,” Arkansas Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith told the AP. “Once we know who’s positive, who’s negative, who’s exposed, who’s not exposed, then we can begin moving people around and that, I would say, is the beginning of containment.”
“Widespread testing really is the most important step we can take to instituting infection control measures that will allow us to reduce transmission of the virus,” Dr. Matthew J. Akiyama, a professor of Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City tells TIME. “We know that congregate settings like prisons and jails are some of the highest risk settings for widespread transmission.”
Keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter.
“In general jails and prisons tend to lag behind in terms of resource allocation,” Dr. Akiyama says, noting the lack of personal protective equipment — or even basic cleaning supplies — being provided to correctional officers and inmates. Experts have long anticipated coronavirus infection rates in jails and prisons across the country impacting a large percentage (and thus, a very large number) of incarcerated people, Akiyama adds.
“Influenza tends to hit prisons very hard,” says Dr. Anne C. Spaulding, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University, “so why would we think that [COVID-19] wouldn’t hit hard?”
Dr. Spaulding believes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other health officials in the country, could have been more aggressive in addressing the impact COVID-19 was going to have on the prison and jail population.
Given the lack of tests currently available in the U.S., Dr. Spaulding questions the value of mass testing blindly, even within at-risk populations, versus the targeted testing of symptomatic individuals. Spaulding wants to see a greater variety of “testing tools” available in order to make large-scale testing feasible. (The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation &amp; Correction did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment on what prompted their testing.)
In New York, where the coronavirus has greatly impacted the prison and jail population, less than one percent of all incarcerated individuals in state prisons have been tested, according to data released by the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS).

“This information provides further proof that Governor Cuomo does not care about the lives of incarcerated people. If he did, then he would test every single person in prison and answer the nation’s call for him to grant broad clemencies to incarcerated New Yorkers, especially those who are vulnerable to the virus,” VOCAL-NY said in a joint statement with criminal justice reform organization Worth Rises and the political activist group Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club.
Other states dealing with coronavirus outbreaks are similarly lacking in data specific to their prison and jail populations (as well as testing thereof). With around 157,000 incarcerated people, Texas currently has the largest prison population in the country, but just 814 inmates have been tested for the coronavirus, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). Of those tests, 438 have tested positive.
California has the second-largest prison population with around 129,000 inmates. 694 of them have been tested, which has resulted in 129 positive tests. And in Florida, which has the third-largest prison population, just 378 prisoners (out of around 98,000 inmates) have been tested for the COVID-19. 119 were positive.
On April 21, health officials in California recommended that mass testing of asymptomatic people should begin across the state, citing environments like prisons and nursing homes as a priority.
On April 22, meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) released a model projecting that, if prison and jail populations are not drastically reduced, COVID-19 could claim 100,000 more lives than current projections forecast. A majority of the additional fatalities projected are incarcerated people, the ACLU says.
“The prevailing epidemiological models largely fail to take into account our incarceration rates,” the ACLU’s chief analytics officer Lucia Tian argued in an accompanying press release. “While we always knew that jails would have an impact on loss of life in this pandemic, the model shows us just how large that impact may be… We can’t save our community while ignoring our jails.”
Health experts and prison doctors have, since the beginning of the outbreak in the U.S., warned of the tinder box-like conditions in prisons and jails — that they are an environment ripe for viral spread. Mass testing seems to confirm these fears, placing further emphasis on the need for proactive public health solutions.
“We are likely facing massive loss of life — both in jails and in communities around the country — if dramatic steps aren’t taken to reduce the incarcerated population in this country,” Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU’s Justice Division, said in the release.

Wuhan Zall returned home this weekend after the government lifted the last restrictions on movement in the city where the COVID-19 outbreak emerged late last year.
The nearly 50 members of the squad had been away since Jan. 2, when the team left to begin training for the Chinese league season that was supposed to start in February but was eventually suspended.
The team’s preseason started in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Wuhan. It was told about 20 days later that it would not be allowed to return to its base because of the coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan ended its 76-day lockdown in early April, allowing people to leave for destinations across China.
Wuhan Zall had already planned a training period in southern Spain, where it arrived in late January. The team’s presence near the city of Málaga prompted fear among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. The team had been away from Wuhan for nearly a month but members of the squad had to be repeatedly tested in Spain before concerns about their condition abated.
None of the squad members tested positive in Spain, but Spanish coach José González said at the time that one of them lost a family member back home because of the virus.
The team went to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid to watch the Spanish league “clásico” between Real Madrid and Barcelona on March 1, which González called a “well-deserved reward” for the team.
The squad was expected to leave Spain in mid-February but had to extend its stay as conditions back home hadn’t fully improved. The team was going to stay training in Spain until at least the end of March but plans had to change again after the situation in Europe took a turn for the worse. Spain became one of the hardest-hit countries by the pandemic and Wuhan Zall officials decided it was time to leave.
The team left on March 14, the day the Spanish government declared a state of emergency and said the entire nation would have to abide by lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of the virus. González said at the time that “things were well” in China so it was better to leave Spain as soon as possible.
The team initially went to the city of Shenzen as restrictions in Wuhan remained in place when the team left Spain. Members of the squad had to enter a mandatory quarantine after arriving in China.
The team went to the nearby city of Foshan after the quarantine was over, and it finally returned home to Wuhan on Saturday.

The researchers responsible for the study had not approved its posting; Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson told STAT that it was “inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments.”
Remdesivir, an experimental drug originally developed to treat Ebola, is not yet approved for that or any other disease. But studies conducted by remdesivir’s maker, Gilead, have shown that the experimental drug could be effective against coronaviruses like those that cause SARS and MERS. So during the COVID-19 crisis, Chinese researchers contacted the company about using it to treat the sickest patients, and Gilead made the drug available under a compassionate use program, to treat those with no other treatment options.
After Gilead agreed, Chinese doctors launched two formal studies of remdesivir; one in severely ill patients, and another in people with milder disease. Both studies compared the drug to a placebo. But in mid-April, both were suspended when scientists could not enroll the more than 400 patients needed for each trial.
The summary posted temporarily to the WHO’s website involved the trial to treat severe patients. The Chinese researchers noted that remdesivir was “not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement,” according to STAT, which took a screen shot of the study before it was removed. In addition, according to the documentation briefly published on the WHO site, after a month, there was almost no difference in the fatality rate of patients given remdesivir compared to those who received the placebo.
In a statement responding to the results, Dr. Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer of Gilead Sciences, said “we believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study. The study was terminated early due to low enrollment and, as a result, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions. As such, the study results are inconclusive, though trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early in the disease.”
Parsey seemingly was referencing recent remdesivir studies involving COVID-19 patients in the U.S., Europe and Canada, which have hinted at more positive results. In one, which involved 53 patients who were treated with remdesivir on a compassionate use basis, 68% of those experiencing severe respiratory symptoms improved after 10 days. In another, involving 125 U.S. patients, most who took the drug improved enough to be discharged from the hospital. However, unlike the Chinese studies, those trials did not compare remdesivir to a placebo.
The studies from China would be the first to provide solid data from gold standard clinical trials that randomly assigned people to remdesivir or placebo. Their results would likely guide decisions about ongoing trials in the U.S. and around the world, including one sponsored by Gilead and another by the National Institutes of Health, seeking to uncover which COVID-19 patients might benefit most from the drug, and when in the course of the disease the drug is most effective. Those studies, however, will take months to complete, regardless of this data leak.

Legend helped kick things off by opening the summit with a stripped-back version of “Lean On Me” solo at his piano at home, and closed out the two-hour digital event with his new song “Bigger Love.” But he also shared a thoughtful conversation with TIME Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal.
Legend has been a long-time advocate for criminal justice reform, an issue that has become increasingly urgent with the spread of COVID-19 through jails and prisons. “It’s been a hotbed for a lot of infections, because so many people are so close to each other, and the conditions already aren’t the best,” Legend explained, noting that not everyone in jail or prison is serving a long-term sentence — or is even guilty of a crime, but instead may simply be unable to pay bail. “That should not carry with it a death sentence,” he said. “We need to think very carefully about who we really need to have in our jails and prisons to keep us safe.” 
He continued: “You should not be able to buy justice in America.”
Outside his efforts to reduce New York prison populations, Legend has been keeping busy: he’s a freshly-minted stay-at-home dad thanks to the coronavirus, a lifestyle change that requires a sense of humor. “When you have kids like we do, being home doesn’t necessarily mean you can a lot more work done,” he said with a laugh. Still, he said, he’s lucky: 4-year-old Luna and nearly 2-year-old Miles are at an age where they are “in heaven hanging out with mom and dad.” (Legend shares parental responsibilities with cookbook author and model Chrissy Teigen, who generously shares stories of their family escapades on social media.)
Thankfully Legend already has an album set for release this summer. He closed out the summit with a solo performance of its title single, the new track “Bigger Love.” “I didn’t know the circumstances under which I’d be releasing it, but here we are,” he said of the record. “I think people could use a little shot of hope and love — and a moment to dance as well.”
Legend’s music has often served as a soundtrack for powerful moments, and he reaffirmed his optimism. “I do believe in the human spirit, and I do believe America and the world are comprised of a lot of people who care about each other,” he said. “If we try our best to summon the best of our human energy and spirit and ingenuity toward making a better future, I think we can do that.”

Dr. Jennings Ryan Staley, a 44-year-old licensed physician who operates a medical spa, was charged with mail fraud on Thursday after allegedly promoting “COVID-19 treatment packs” which Staley said could offer immunity from the coronavirus for six weeks and could “100%” cure it, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California.
Starting in late March, Staley’s company, Skinny Beach Med Spa in Carmel Valley, Calif., started to send out email advertisements for the packs, which were priced at $3,995 for four people. Although the spa typically offered beauty services, including botox, laser treatments and fat transfers, the COVID-19 pack offered the medications hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, “anti-anxiety treatments” and access to Staley. President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the use of these particular medications to treated COVID-19 at press conferences, calling the unproven drugs “a game changer.”
The FBI started to investigate Staley after receiving a tip from the public, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In a recorded call with an undercover agent posing as a customer, Staley said the medication he was offering was a “an amazing cure” for COVID-19 that worked as a “magic bullet.”
“It’s preventative and curative. It’s hard to believe, it’s almost too good to be true. But it’s a remarkable clinical phenomenon,” Staley said, adding that the disease “literally disappears in hours” according to the release.
However, while both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been used by some physicians treat COVID-19, scientists say there isn’t enough evidence to recommend the drugs as treatments for SARS-CoV-2, and warn that there is no known cure for COVID-19. Experts also warn that taking hydroxychloroquine in particular, which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders, may pose serious safety risks.
Dr. David Sullivan, professor of microbiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has told TIME, “In general if hydroxychloroquine really, really worked, and it was a magic drug for COVID-19, we would know it by now.”
During the FBI’s overt investigation a week after the call, Staley denied saying that the treatment was a 100% cure for the infection caused by the virus, saying, “No, that would be foolish. We would never say anything like that.” 
Staley had allegedly also claimed that his broker brought hydroxychloroquine from China to make the pills, smuggling the drugs through customs by describing it as sweet potato extract. Shipping records showed that Staley was scheduled to import supposed “yam extract.”
Staley also allegedly offered the undercover agent Xanax without conducting a medical examination, the release said.
Omer Meisel, the acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office said in a statement that false cures would be “vigorously investigated by the FBI.”
“The FBI is using a variety of tools to identify anyone who exploits the current crisis with fraudulent scams or a variety of cyber schemes – and is proactively warning the public about products claiming to save lives, before losing their money or creating false hope. Scammers seeking to profit by exploiting fear and uncertainty during this COVID-19 pandemic will be brought to justice,” Meisel said.
If convicted, Staley could face up to 20 years in prison, a fine or other penalties.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic has exposed how fragile societies are but that if governments work together on common challenges, including global warming, it can be an opportunity to “rebuild our world for the better.”
Speaking at a two-day international meeting on climate change, the United Nations chief said the only effective response to the worldwide health emergency is “brave, visionary and collaborative leadership.”
“The same leadership is needed to address the looming existential threat of climate disruption,” Guterres said, noting that the past decade was the hottest in history since measurements began.
He urged the European Union to show “global leadership” by presenting updated emissions reduction plans by the end of the year that would put Europe on course to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
But Guterres added that other big emitters also have come on board. He noted that the Group of 20 major developed and emerging economies together account for more than 80% of global emissions.
“The Paris Agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the United States and China,” he said, referring to a 2015 climate accord. “Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.”
Under President Donald Trump, the United States has moved to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which commits to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) by the end of the century.
“These are dark days, but they are not without hope,” Guterres said. “We have a rare and short window of opportunity to rebuild our world for the better.”
“Let us use the pandemic recovery to provide a foundation for a safe, healthy, inclusive and more resilient world for all people,” he added.

“Mayo shared the masking policy with the VP’s office,” the Mayo Clinic said in a statement provided to TIME.
The Mayo Clinic is located in Rochester, Minn., and is one of the leading sites on coronavirus research. Pence — who leads the White House’s coronavirus task force — visited the center’s blood and plasma donation center to learn about its “moon-shot” testing program, which aims to increase Minnesota’s testing capability to 20,000 tests a day.
Video shows at one point at least ten people — including a patient — wearing masks around Pence, while he remained mask-less. CNN reports that Pence was, in fact, the only person in the entire building not wearing a mask.
After criticism of both Pence’s behavior and the Clinic’s decision to allow him to enter without a mask began spreading online, the Mayo Clinic tweeted at 2:18 p.m. that, “Mayo Clinic had informed @VP of the masking policy prior to his arrival today.” The tweet has since been deleted.

In early April the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidance to recommend that the general public — including people who are not exhibiting any coronavirus symptoms — wear non-medical face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
While First Lady Melania Trump has released a video encouraging Americans to wear face masks, President Trump has said he does not plan to follow the CDC’s guidance.

As the owner of Alidoro Sandwich Shop in New York City, he says that it’s been remarkable to pull up to long lines of medical workers and see their excitement as his restaurant brings them food. 
In TIME’s new video series, Streep tells Katie Couric that he has been humbled to assist medical workers as they fight the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed nearly 13,000 lives in New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s estimate.
In the video above, Streep tells Couric that his sandwich shop has been donating lunch boxes to hospital workers around the city, including NYU Langone, and is donating 20% of the proceeds from its bottled olive oil to World Central Kitchen, a non-profit that provides meals after natural disasters. 
“In many ways, you and your workers are on the front lines, because you’re providing nourishment, and I would say a little bit of love, to all the healthcare providers who are working so hard these days,” Couric said to Streep.
Streep said since the pandemic began, he had to let a majority of his workforce go to keep the business afloat. Since then, he says the shop’s philanthropic efforts gave them a boost, which has enabled him to hire again.
Streep said that he’s been struck by the medical workers’ determination, saying that they’re “some of the hardest-working people in the world, but you can also tell they’re not gonna stop.”

Its Facebook page posted a cheerful story encouraging relatives to quiz their aging loved ones about their lives, and photos of smiling third graders at a nearby school making flower arrangements for residents.
That quickly changed. By the middle of March, the CEO began sending increasingly alarmed emails about banning visitors, screening staff, confining residents, wiping down all surfaces, and having all-hands-on-deck meetings to prepare everyone for the coming coronavirus “freight train.”
“I’ll be darned if I’m not going to do everything in my power to protect them,” Donny Tuchman wrote before things got worse. More than 100 staffers, nearly a third of the workforce, went out sick. Those left began wearing garbage bags because of a shortage of protective gear. Not a single resident has been able to get tested for the virus to this day.
Now listed with 55 deaths it can only assume were caused by COVID-19, among the most of any such facility in the country, Cobble Hill Health Center has become yet another glaring example of the nation’s struggle to control the rapid spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes that care for the most frail and vulnerable.
Cobble Hill’s grim toll surpasses not only Kirkland’s but the 49 deaths at a home outside of Richmond, Virginia, 48 dead at a veteran’s home in Holyoke, Mass., and five other homes in outer boroughs of New York City that have at least 40 deaths each.
Out of an Associated Press tally of 8,003 nursing home deaths nationwide, a third of them are in New York state.
AP interviews with friends and relatives who have visited the Cobble Hill Health Center in recent weeks, as well as the home’s own statements, paint a picture of a facility overwhelmed and unequipped to deal with its coronavirus outbreak, with shortages of staff, personal protective equipment and the availability of reliable testing.
“They were under siege,” said Daniel Arbeeny, who brought his ailing 88-year-old father from a hospital to the home in late March. “They were doing the best they could, as far as we could tell at arm’s length, under siege.”
Tuchman told the AP on Sunday that he believes many other homes have more deaths than Cobble Hill but his has been singled out for its honesty. He said it responded to the state’s voluntary survey with cases in which it was “possible” COVID-19 could be a factor, since his home wasn’t able to test any due to the lack of available kits. He also said he reported 50 deaths, not 55, though the state repeated that tally Sunday.
“There’s been a lot of lip service about how vulnerable nursing homes have been, and everyone has the best intentions, but it didn’t materialize,” Tuchman said. “The PPE didn’t materialize, the staffing surge didn’t materialize, the testing didn’t materialize. … How did we expect this not to spread?”
Though Tuchman doesn’t know for sure how the virus got into Cobble Hill, he noted there has been a parade of paramedics and staffers allowed into the building each day who were screened with health questions and temperature checks, not enough to keep out those who are sick but not showing symptoms.
Soon after news broke of Cobble Hill’s death toll, Steven Vince went there to talk to administrators about his recently passed uncle, whose death certificate listed him possibly having COVID. An administrator told him they were confident his uncle did not have the virus.
“It’s very surprising because I don’t think anyone from the facility contacted us to tell us anything like this or basically bring this to our attention in any way,” he said.
Eva Buchmuller, a New York City artist whose best friend has lived in Cobble Hill with Alzheimer’s for three years, said she wasn’t that surprised the virus spread in the nursing home’s cramped quarters, with small rooms tightly packed along narrow corridors and residents not allowed to open windows. She believes it’s highly likely her friend is infected.
“How could you avoid not getting the virus?” she said, adding it’s “always, always filled up.”
Built in a stately brick building that once was a 19th-century hospital, Cobble Hill was most recently rated three out of five stars by the federal government for overall quality and the facility has a complaint rate that’s half that of the statewide average for nursing homes.
Its beds are in high demand — it has 98 percent occupancy, according to the state — in a city that has seen closures in nursing homes that developers have eyed for apartments.
Over the years, it’s shown signs of innovation. It has, at various points, taught massage therapy to nursing assistants, housed a small alternative public high school, brought local artists in to teach residents dance, offered music therapy and was at the forefront of nursing homes setting up Alzheimer’s units and cutting reliance on antipsychotics that can leave residents with dementia.
In early 2018, Cobble Hill boasted on its website that it was hosting a delegation of 18 physicians and hospital administrators from Hubei Province, China — which would become the global epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak — “to see best practices first hand.”
Earlier this month, Daniel Arbeeny and his family decided to move his elderly father — who was not believed to have COVID-19 — from the Cobble Hill facility to the family’s home on a nearby block. After he left, the family helped coordinate a donation of face shields and doesn’t blame the nursing home for the outbreak or its outcome.
“To me, it’s just a bad situation,” he said. “They were dealt a bad set of cards.”
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”that the situation at Cobble Hill and other nursing homes in the city shows that “you cannot pretend that this ferocious disease is simply going to walk away at one point or just flick a switch and it’s gone.”

She has stage-4, terminal breast cancer that has spread to her brain. To keep it from penetrating further into other organs, she’s currently on chemotherapy, which weakens her body and puts her at high risk for a number of health problems—including infectious diseases like COVID-19.
Soon after public health officials identified SARS-CoV-2 virus as the cause of a previously unknown illness in the Hubei province of China, doctors realized that the novel coronavirus seemed to zero in on certain demographics: older people, as well as those with existing chronic diseases and weakened immune systems like Kraemer, 43. “From very early on, I felt vulnerable and scared,” she says. “People were saying ‘everybody don’t worry, this will only affect the sick people.’ I felt vulnerable and expendable.”
Now another specter threatens Kraemer’s already tenuous hold on health. If she develops COVID-19, and needs intensive care and help from a ventilator to breathe, she might be denied access. “With my diagnosis of metastatic terminal breast cancer with brain metastases, doctors will go, ‘Wow, she’s on her way out anyway,” she says. “The fact that I could go to the emergency room with COVID-19 and they might deem me not worthy of care is mind-alteringly terrifying.”
Anywhere from 3% to 19% of COVID-19 patients will wind up in an intensive care unit (ICU), often requiring ventilators to breathe. The number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is, as of writing, nearing 1 million, which means roughly 150,000 additional patients for the country’s already-stressed ICU system. If the flow of patients continues to outpace the supply of ventilators, doctors will be making heart-wrenching decisions about how to distribute those precious few devices.
This is the harsh truth that administrators at Henry Ford Health Systems in Michigan tried to address in a controversial letter that leaked on social media on March 27. The letter was intended for patients (and their families), explaining the facility’s approach to rationing ICU services: “Some patients will be extremely sick and very unlikely to survive their illness even with critical treatment. Treating these patients would take away resources for patients who might survive.”
The letter, which was part of the hospital’s preparations for emergency actions if supplies to treat patients dwindled, went on to provide a bulleted list of the types of patients who may be “not eligible for ICU or ventilator care,” including those with severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; terminal cancers; and severe trauma or burns. “We crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency,” Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of the Henry Ford Health System wrote on Twitter in response to questions about the letter. “It is our hope we never have to apply them, and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.”
“Being in the midst of a public health emergency triggers a change in the ethical principles that we use to make care decisions,” says Dr. Douglas White, director of the program of ethics and decision making in critical illness at the University of Pittsburgh. “A public health emergency shifts focus from individual patients and trying to maximize their well-being, to looking at outcomes for an entire population.”
Which means that people with a cancer prognosis like Kraemer might be considered ineligible to receive a bed in an ICU because their chances of survival are low. To Kraemer, this feels like a primitive approach. “I am more than just words on a paper. I am more than a diagnosis of stage-4 cancer,” she says. “There has to be a more sophisticated way than categorically excluding entire populations.”
Doctors’ Coronavirus Dilemma
In 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked the state’s Department of Health to develop an algorithm to anticipate the need for ventilators in the event of a flu pandemic like the H1N1 outbreak of 2009. The commission responded with a 272-page report prudently calling for buying up ventilators sufficient for a flu outbreak.
Them, COVID-19 made a mockery of all of that planning.
With its dense population and popularity as an international travel destination, New York has become ground zero for the U.S. wing of the current pandemic and has completely annihilated whatever formulas the state had in place to allocate resources for prevention and containment of such an outbreak.
“COVID-19 is not like the flu at all,” says Dr. Chen Fu, clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center, who has spent the pandemic working in the hospital’s critical-care ward. “We’re finding that these patients who are intubated with COVID-19 lung disease are extremely hard to take off the ventilator. It’s almost like a black hole.”
It’s largely this fact that is contributing to the nationwide shortage of ventilators, forcing doctors to make the kinds of existential choices—picking who gets to live and who must die—that both they and their patients would have been spared in the past. “In normal times we practice a sort of hopeful, benevolence-based medicine,” Fu says. “Whereas now we have to practice a sort of holistic justice-based medicine. I have to think about how to help society as a whole.”
That involves not just denying care to patients like Kraemer, but sometimes withdrawing it after it’s been provided. Fu and other members of the hospital staff recently faced one such mortal choice when they were treating a terminally ill patient on a high-flow ventilator—a step down from full intubation, and which is also in short supply as a result of the pandemic. The ventilator offered the dying patient not just comfort, but also a certain measure of end-of-life dignity. On another floor, however, a COVID-19 patient who had a greater chance of survival was panting for air and in desperate need of a high-flow ventilator. One machine, two patients, and Fu’s group had to make the call.
The algorithm—which was also a part of the 2015 New York State report—made it for them: “We took that machine away from the patient who was dying,” he says.
The patient did die, and the experience—for the doctors, the patient and the family—was harrowing. “Whenever you apply statistics to an individual it’s always very messy,” Fu says, “because individuals have their own desires, they have their own history.”
The People Behind the Machines
Ventilators are currently scarce, but when industry steps up—as the Ford Motor Company and General Motors recently did, committing to build tens of thousands of ventilators each—the gap can be filled relatively fast. Health care workers can’t be ordered up so quickly.
“A critical care physician takes a total of 10 years to train,” says Fu, “four years of medical school, three years of residency and three more years of critical care fellowship.”
At Boston University’s Boston Medical Center, this has led to on-the-fly staffing decisions. “In the internal medicine units where I work,” says Dr. James Hudspeth, medical director of the COVID-19 response team at Boston Medical, “usually we’re staffing with internists [but] at this point we are pulling in a subset from other specialties to help us out.” The hospital’s nursing team is being similarly stretched, Hudspeth says, with floor nurses, who are not specialists in critical care, being pressed into service alongside ICU nurses.
Supplies of medications being called up to alleviate some of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19 are also dwindling. For example, there are developing shortages of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor (which can reduce inflammation and help relieve infection), a fact that’s forcing other tough decisions.
Dr. Bushra Mina, chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill Northwell Hospital in New York begins the day with 10 to 20 vials of IL-6 inhibitor. Every time he thinks about using one of these vials, he has to judge whether it might be wiser to save it for a later, more desperate patient. “It’s like military triage,” he says.
Hudspeth worries that if an existing drug does prove effective against SARS-CoV-2, there will be a stampede for it—especially if it’s rare or expensive. “It’s instantaneously on the market and then at that point we may also be forced to do more rationing,” he says.
Then too there is the COVID-19-related rationing that has nothing to do with COVID-19, at least not directly. Doctors pressed into emergency medicine may no longer be available to their regular patients for appointments to check up on chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. That, in turn, increases the risk of an at-home emergency. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, epidemiologists recorded a spike in deaths from preventable causes, as the epidemic swallowed the health care system whole, leaving the medically vulnerable uncared-for.
“I’m confident we’re going to see that play out again [with COVID-19] globally and potentially within the United States,” says Hudspeth, noting that the number of heart attack and stroke patients coming into Boston Medical Center in the last few weeks has been lower than they would normally expect. “They’re probably suffering those at home.”
A New Framework for Health Care Rationing
Currently, the U.S. has no national criteria for allocating ICU beds and ventilators during an emergency like a pandemic. So, doctors and hospital officials have largely been relying on the guidelines of professional specialty groups, including those published in 2008 by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), for making decisions about how to allocate scarce resources to treat respiratory disorders.
The ACCP guidelines hinge on the so-called “exclusion criteria,” which advise not considering ICU care for people with moderate-to-severe heart or lung disease, those with terminal cancer — like Kraemer— the elderly, and people with severe cognitive impairment. Such policies, says White, are discriminatory from both an ethical as well as legal perspective. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights in April conducted a review of Alabama’s 2010 guidelines for rationing ventilators based on exclusion criteria, for allegedly discriminating based on age and disability. The state has since revised its guidelines to be compliant with federal civil rights laws.
The ACCP did not clarify the reasoning behind its guidelines in its official publications, but White says it’s likely that the medical association relied on standard metrics for evaluating patients’ health and, given their medical histories, considered most of them as less likely to survive whatever brought them into the ICU than those without those underlying conditions.
After the ACCP put out its guidelines, White and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh felt “that was a very big overreach in terms of abandoning traditional medical ethics in favor of a public health ethic,” he says. “When the lever gets pulled and a public health emergency is declared, that indicates the need to do things differently than we normally do, and to allocate resources differently. But exclusion criteria are the wrong tool for the job. They send the wrong message that people’s lives are being judged not worth saving. The ethics of medicine are diametrically against that kind of thinking.”
So White and his colleagues proposed a different framework, which they published in 2009. Their approach assigns a “priority score” to every patient, based on a constellation of factors including existing health conditions, as well as something called “life years gained,” or the likelihood of living beyond the current crisis. Doctors score a patient’s chances of surviving and of living more years once they are discharged, each on a scale of one to four, with one representing the highest likelihood. These two numbers are combined, and the final score determines a patient’s priority for ICU care.
The system provides a “brutal reckoning” for how bad the supply shortages are, says White. “If we just exclude people, then those people disappear from the calculus.” But by giving everyone a priority score, this framework accounts for those patients who, in normal circumstances would be treated, but in times of scarce resources, are denied care. “It doesn’t allow us to brush under the rug how bad things are.”
For the last decade or so, the framework has been more of a theoretical exercise than a necessity, but that changed when patients began flooding hospitals with COVID-19. “When things began going sideways in China, and again more recently with what happened in Italy, a number of institutions [started] reaching out to me asking about our framework,” says White. “They wanted to know if we were using it [at the University of Pittsburgh] and if it had been incorporated into our hospital policy,” he says.
So, he condensed the principles from the original proposal into a “very operational, practical step-by-step recipe hospitals could cut and paste into whatever format they need,” he says, which the University of Pittsburgh published on its website on March 22.
The system is inspired by the one used in the U.S. to allocate organs for transplant, which relies on the “lifecycle principle,” taking into account where a person is in their overall life cycle, and how much more life they have left to experience. The lifecycle principle holds that if all other things are equal as far as patients’ priority score, and there is only one ventilator available, doctors could prioritize younger people, who have had less chance to live their lives, over older people who have likely enjoyed more life experiences. It also accounts for “instrumental value,” which suggests prioritizing those who may, if they survive, further the goals of improving public health—health care workers, for example, who could then go on to save more lives.
There is clearly interest in an alternative to the current standard of care. In the first three days after they were posted, the new guidelines were downloaded more than 2,000 times; Pennsylvania health authorities have already asked all hospitals in the state to utilize these guidelines, and Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado and Oklahoma have followed suit.
Surging On in the COVID-19 Pandemic
There would, of course, be no need for these ethically wrenching choices if there were enough ICU personnel, beds, and other equipment to handle the patient load.
In a matter of weeks after the first COVID-19 patients were confirmed, the Chinese government turned arenas into field facilities and erected two entirely new hospitals in Wuhan. In New York City, Mount Sinai Hospital and the charity Samaritan’s Purse worked together to build a 68-bed tent facility in Central Park to care for some of the city’s COVID-19 overflow; the field hospital began receiving patients on March 31. Los Angeles County went New York one better when, on April 13, it opened a 266-bed surge ward within the walls of the recently shuttered St. Vincent’s Hospital.
In ordinary circumstances—even an ordinary epidemic—surge hospitals like these wouldn’t be necessary. All hospitals in California are supposed to have a 20% to 40% surge capacity within their own walls, says Dr. Christina Ghaly, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. That capacity is mostly generated by canceling elective surgeries and converting the facilities used for same-day surgery, anesthesia-recovery and even emergency medicine into ICUs.
But COVID-19 isn’t an ordinary epidemic and free-standing surge facilities are an important—if imperfect—adjunct.
In mid-March, the Los Angeles County and California State departments of health began work on a statistical model projecting one month ahead, which sought to forecast when peak demand for hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators would hit, and what that peak would look like. “What the model showed,” Ghaly says, “is that we had sufficient bed capacity for COVID-19 patients within our existing hospital supply, but there was a shortage of ICU beds.” That added to the impetus to repurpose St. Vincent’s, which came online a month later to fill the gap.
Perhaps, however, the U.S. could develop a system that would forestall any sort of care-rationing, even in the midst of a public health disaster like COVID-19. Hudspeth suggests one solution: building a national medical corps not unlike the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which could mobilize fast, get on-site where needed, and have personnel and equipment ready to move when a pandemic hits, much the way FEMA mobilizes for a hurricane. “Not having a system that makes it possible to move personnel and necessary equipment between different parts of states and basically across the United States as a whole is a really glaring gap that we face,” he says. “We could have critical care physicians, infection control specialists, critical care nurses who could work their way across the country as different hot spots flare up.”
That would address not only a crying medical need, but a crying ethical one, Hudspeth says, sparing frontline caregivers from having to make the kinds of calls Fu and his colleagues made when they withdrew the ventilator from the terminally ill patient and gave it instead to someone who had a better chance to survive. It would also spare patients like Kraemer, suffering from one disease, from becoming collateral casualties of another one, simply because the resources to care for them are no longer there.
When Kraemer learned her breast cancer had spread, her doctor couldn’t guarantee that she would live another two years. That was four years ago, thanks to experimental therapies she tried by participating in a variety of clinical trials. That’s what she hopes doctors will remember if she does need hospitalization for COVID-19.
But as it stands, Kraemer has been forced to do the unthinkable and make a case for her life should she get sick with COVID-19. In order to ensure that emergency health care workers look beyond her medical chart to see her as an individual patient, she recorded a video of herself, at her current doctor’s suggestion, to show that, despite being a terminal cancer patient, she does not currently suffer any serious health consequences—and that she deserves potentially life-saving treatment in the ICU, were she to develop COVID-19.
“It was scary, and I thought, ‘This is what it’s come to, that I have to prove that my life is worth saving,” she says. “I laid out that I expect to receive ICU placement if I needed it, and that I expect to receive a ventilator if that’s necessary, too. To have hospital administrators essentially write us an early death sentence for something completely terrible that happened to us through no fault of our own—it’s brutal.”"

Still, floor trading makes up 18% of all NYSE trading volume, so theres undoubtedly going to be challenges. Earlier this week, Hard Fork reported that many on Wall Street were already fed up with lacklustre responses from their employers.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange, another major American trading hub, also closed its futures trading floor earlier this month  but at the time there were only 54 traders still showing up, accounting for just a traction of the overall trading volume.
NYSEs temporary measures are set to come in place on Monday, but the exchange is yet to advise when it expects to re-open physical trading floors. So, Wall Street had better get comfy at home.

Pearce has lupus and takes hydroxychloroquine every day. Recently, her local pharmacy in Vermont ran out of the drugs and stopped filling her long-term prescription. So, she found an authorized online seller and bought a shipment of the medicine, paying $178 out-of-pocket.
""My hydroxychloroquine was sent from the United Kingdom and it took about three weeks to get here,"" Pearce said. ""In the meantime, I've had to go down on my dosage, just to make it last.""
Pearce is one of 1.5 million Americans with lupus, an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks its own healthy cells. Hydroxychloroquine, and the similar drug chloroquine, are among the most effective approved prescription treatments for lupus and other autoimmune diseases.
But these drugs became scarce last month after President Donald Trump began touting them as ""game-changer"" breakthroughs for Covid-19. There is even a fledgling black market, with pills being advertised on the dark web for as much as $43 each. (The ordinary rate is around $1.)
Trump has since shifted his rhetoric toward reopening the country, but vulnerable Americans who rely on hydroxychloroquine are still dealing with the fallout and they're taking increasingly dangerous steps to get the drugs, according to interviews with nearly a dozen doctors, nurses and Americans with chronic diseases who have been scrambling to refill their prescriptions.
Beginning in mid-March, Trump name-dropped the drugs nearly 50 times, according to a CNN analysis of his public comments. His claims were never backed up by hard science, and Trump toned down his praise after evidence recently mounted over the drugs' potentially deadly side effects. As of Tuesday night, he hadn't mentioned the drugs by name in more than a week.
Asked on Tuesday about the dim results from these latest trials, including a study of US veterans' hospitals, Trump said he didn't see the news. Still, the drug shortages remain.
""It's not surprising to me that people are resorting to desperate measures, or taking medications that friends or even strangers have on hand,"" said Dr. Jinoos Yazdany, chief of rheumatology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, which is located near a major Covid-19 hotspot. ""It's certainly not an ideal state of affairs. We are doing harm to a vulnerable patient population."" 
Fallout continues from shortages
Panic set in last month for Anna Valdez, 50, after she couldn't refill her hydroxychloroquine prescription. Valdez, who teaches nursing in the San Francisco Bay Area, said her lupus symptoms would likely flare within weeks without her daily medicine. A severe flare could lead to hospitalization -- a dangerous proposition, especially during the coronavirus pandemic.
So, in a moment of ""stress and fear,"" Valdez did something she doesn't train her nursing students to do she accepted prescription pills in the mail from someone she never met. 
""It was kind of surreal,"" Valdez told CNN, explaining that a nurse from Baltimore unexpectedly reached out after she tweeted about her dwindling medicine supply. ""I felt a mix of things, the most important of which was gratitude. Being a nurse, I have an immense trust in other nurses.""
In addition to the Twitter outreach from a fellow nurse, Valdez received an unsolicited email from one of her nursing students at Santa Rosa Junior College, who revealed that her healthy parents obtained some hydroxychloroquine during the rush for possible coronavirus treatments. 
""We all know Dr. Valdez has lupus, and she mentioned during a Zoom meeting that still can't get her prescriptions and is afraid of running out,"" the student, Lauren Palleschi, told CNN. ""I sat on it for a little while ... but I just couldn't let it go any more, and so I sent her an email. I told her I was embarrassed and ashamed, but I do have this medication, and if you want it, it's yours.""
Unnerving -- and heartfelt -- stories like these are unfolding across the country, with doctors and patients reporting shortages, while others are able to get the medicine they need. The burden is being shouldered disproportionately by women, who make up about 90% of adults with lupus.
Shoshanna Richman, 38, said hydroxychloroquine was the only treatment that made her strong enough to work after being diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, an autoimmune disease that leads to fatigue and severe joint pain. But her New York City pharmacy didn't have the pills.
So, Richman scrambled, and tapped into her personal networks for help, until one of her sister's friends mentioned that her local drugstore in Alabama still had hydroxychloroquine. Richman's doctor transferred the prescription, and the friend mailed the pills to Richman in Queens.
High praise, then mixed results
These Americans say they're primarily concerned about getting the life-saving medicines they need, but can't help but draw a direct connection between Trump's showmanship and the shortages that began cropping up shortly after his public relations campaign for the drugs.
Over a few weeks, Trump incorrectly claimed they were ""safe"" to tread Covid-19, encouraged Americans to ""try it,"" and said there would be ""nothing lost"" by touting their potential upside.
Before Trump ever publicly mentioned the drugs, right-wing firebrands and conspiracy theorists shared information about chloroquine online, according to the Washington Post. These claims made their way onto Fox News, and Trump also personally heard about the drugs from his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the billionaire founder of Oracle, according to The New York Times. 
Even after being warned by federal health officials about the potential side effects, including serious cardiac complications, Trump continued promoting the drugs with over-the-top rhetoric. He went much farther than the nation's leading public health authorities, even tweeting that hydroxychloroquine treatment could be the biggest breakthrough ""in the history of medicine.""
According to a CNN analysis of Trump's near-daily briefings, Trump revved up his fanfare about hydroxychloroquine in mid-March and continued touting the drugs for three weeks straight. 
Reuters reported that Trump personally pressed the Food and Drug Administration chief and other public health officials to quickly make the drugs available. The FDA gave hospitals emergency authorization on March 28 to use the drugs on Covid-19 patients or in clinical trials.
But Trump's glowing praise dropped off significantly in mid-April, amid a series of negative developments, and he hasn't mentioned the drugs by name at his White House briefings since April 13. Around that time, a French study concluded that the drugs didn't help hospitalized coronavirus patients, and a Brazilian trial was halted after deadly cardiac complications. 
This week, a study at US veterans hospitals found that the drugs might lead to a higher death rate among Covid-19 patients. Asked Tuesday about the results, Trump was uncharacteristically quiet, said he didn't hear about the veterans' study, and quickly moved onto the next question. 
CNN also reported that Fox News has similarly abandoned its earlier promotion of the drugs, a stunning turnaround after the right-wing network touted the drugs hundreds of times on-air.
A burgeoning black market
The shortages for sick Americans who need the drugs, and the fear among Americans who don't want to catch the coronavirus, have created a potential for an underground black market.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which were originally developed to fight malaria, require a prescription from a doctor. SingleCare, a prescription discount website with millions of users across the country, says demand among its customer base for anti-malarial drugs increased by 207% over the past month. That was a far larger spike than any other category of medications.
There are currently sellers on the dark web, offering what they claim is hydroxychloroquine, according to GroupSense, a cyber intelligence firm based in Virginia. Some of the posts are obvious scams, but others are from sellers with strong reviews who are considered reliable. 
""In our initial cursory search, we found evidence of the black market,"" lead analyst Bryce Webster-Jacobsen told CNN. ""It seems like some people had a legitimate supply before the pandemic and are now selling it, after the comments from politicians that they might be a cure for coronavirus. Our assessment is that there is a market for it, and there is supply of the drugs.""
One vendor was selling individual hydroxychloroquine tablets for $43, which is a massively inflated rate for a generic drug. The vendor said they had a few dozen pills left, and the website indicated that at least one pill was sold in the last 24 hours.
There were other listings that appeared to be scams, where unvetted users with new accounts were offering massive quantities of raw hydroxychloroquine powder, Webster-Jacobsen said.
The FBI appears to have made its first hydroxychloroquine-related arrest last week, charging a San Diego doctor with mail fraud after he allegedly peddled $4,000 ""family resistance packs"" containing hydroxychloroquine and other drugs that Trump claimed could work for Covid-19.
A lawyer for the man, Dr. Jennings Staley, told CNN that the charges were not legally justified.
Staley allegedly told an undercover FBI agent, ""you could be short of breath and coughing at noon today, and if I start your hydroxychloroquine loading dose, you'll feel 99% better by noon tomorrow,"" according to the criminal complaint, which cited their recorded conversation. Staley also allegedly claimed he smuggled more than 8,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine out of China.
For Americans with lupus and other chronic illnesses, all this unwanted attention on the drugs they've used for decades has created a public health crisis on top of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Hydroxychloroquine is an inexpensive and generic medication, so we should be able to secure a steady supply for patients who require it,"" said Yazdany, the San Francisco rheumatologist.

US president echoed this, saying: The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus. But is he right?
The idea that the approaching spring may stem the spread of the disease comes largely from a comparison with the flu. In many ways COVID-19 is like the flu both spread in similar ways (respiratory secretions and contaminated surfaces) and both cause typically mild respiratory diseases that can develop into life-threatening pneumonia. But the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 are much greater than the flu. And it isnt clear if COVID-19 transmission will be affected by seasonal temperature variation.
For the flu, the start of spring causes a significant drop in the number of cases that persists until the return of colder temperatures in autumn. This seasonality of the flu is thought to be caused by the sensitivity of the virus to different climates and by seasonal changes in the human immune system and in our patterns of behavior.
First, the flu virus appears to survive better in cold, dry weather with reduced ultraviolet light. Second, for many of us, the shorter winter days lead to reduced levels of vitamin D and melatonin, which can affect the performance of our immune system. Third, in the winter we spend more time with other people, indoors and in closer proximity, increasing opportunities for the virus to spread.

How then would these factors affect coronavirus transmission? It is not clear what effect temperature and humidity have on the coronavirus itself, nor on its transmission. Some other coronaviruses are seasonal, causing common colds in the winter months.
The 2002-2003 Sars epidemic also began in the northern hemisphere winter and ended in July 2003 with a small resurgence in cases in the following winter. But Sars cases peaked in the warmer month of May, and the end of the epidemic in July may simply reflect the time required for virus containment, rather than an effect of the summer weather on virus transmission. Also, the related Mers coronavirus is primarily transmitted in hot countries.
Returning to the comparison with the flu, the 2009-2010 influenza virus pandemic began in the spring, increased in strength over the spring and summer and peaked the following winter. This suggests that in a pandemic, the high number of cases in many countries around the world could enable continued transmission of the virus throughout the summer, overcoming any seasonal variability that would be seen in smaller epidemics.
So the approaching warmer weather may reduce viral transmission in the northern hemisphere (while potentially increasing transmission in the coming southern hemisphere winter), but it is highly unlikely that the weather itself will end this growing epidemic.

Four months later, the world is in the middle of a pandemic with little idea of what comes next. Yet this is not the first pandemic to occur in recent years. On March 17 2009, the first case of a novel H1N1 influenza virus infection, also known as swine flu, was documented in Mexico. It rapidly spread throughout Mexico and the US and was declared a full pandemic by the WHO on June 11 2009.
Swine flu circulated around the world in two waves until August 10 2010, when the WHO officially declared the pandemic over. By comparing the coronavirus pandemic with the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic and looking at modern forecast models, we might be able to better assess what to expect over the coming weeks to months.
As of March 22, we are in week 16 of the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly equivalent to July 8 2009 of the H1N1 pandemic. These two points in time offer a useful comparison as the number of cases in both the US and UK were at nearly identical levels in both pandemics.
The comparison highlights four important differences. First, with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic beginning in North America, the US had the highest number of cases at week 16. This contrasts with the COVID-19 pandemic with the highest number of cases reflecting the viruss origins in China.
2009 H1N1 data as of July 6 2009 was obtained from: https://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_07_06/en/. Current COVID-19 data was obtained on March 22 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries and https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. Jeremy Rossman
Second, there are already over three times as many cases of COVID-19 as there were pandemic H1N1 cases in the same time period. This probably reflects the R0 or replication number of the virus this refers to how many people, on average, an infected person will spread the virus to. For the 2009 H1N1 virus it was estimated to be 1.5, whereas COVID-19 is estimated to be between 2.38 and 3.28.
Third, the number of fatalities for COVID-19 is far greater than that seen with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This reflects a case-fatality rate or CFR the proportion of deaths compared with the total number of people diagnosed of 2.3% for COVID-19 compared to the estimated 0.048% CFR for 2009 H1N1 in the US. The rate of hospitalization also differs with each virus: for COVID-19 an estimated 14% of cases will require hospitalization, much higher than the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
Finally, the rate of COVID-19 fatalities is increasing almost twice as fast as was seen at this time for the 2009 H1N1 virus. The H1N1 pandemic lasted nearly 16 months and by the end of the pandemic on August 10 2010 the WHO determined that there had been 6,724,149 confirmed cases and 18,449 confirmed deaths over 214 countries.
Week 16 of the H1N1 pandemic reflects only 1.4% of what would be the total number of cases one year later. If we experience the same trend with COVID-19, we would have 23,862,575 cases in the beginning of May 2021. With an estimated case fatality rate of 2.3%, that would give 548,839 fatalities worldwide.
With both pandemics, there are many mild cases that often go undetected and unconfirmed. For the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic this has been retrospectively examined and it was estimated that in the US there were 61,000,000 cases, 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,470 deaths. This means that the number of confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases was only 0.056% of the actual number of cases and would give a revised global fatality rate of 0.021%.
For COVID-19, recent reports from China suggest confirmed cases represent only 14% of the total number of cases. If so, there would be 578,957 cases in China, giving a fatality rate of 0.56 half the 1.17% currently seen in South Korea. Even using that lower rate, there could be still 133,630 fatalities caused by COVID-19. Given that we have almost reached the same level of cumulative deaths as seen during the whole 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be far greater than that experienced in 2009-10.
Epidemic modeling
As the current pandemic is already surpassing the number of fatalities seen in 2009, we can expand our predictive analysis by modeling the spread of COVID-19 using recent epidemiological data from China. The graph below shows the predicted number of cases (in pink) and cumulative fatalities (in blue) in the US for each day over the coming year, if no containment measures are taken.
SEIR model was created at http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html. Date of first case was set as 20 Jan: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191 and intervention set as day 63 (22 March). R0, incubation and infectious period were based on: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.long. CFR was based on: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.long. All other values were as recently described: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56. Jeremy Rossman using Gabriel Gohs Epidemic Calculator
Even with the conservative estimate of a 0.56% case fatality rate and a 2.38 R0, COVID-19 would result in over 1.6 million fatalities in the US and 330,000 in the UK within one year. The peak hospitalization burden of 10.8 million people in the US would also overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure, significantly increasing the effective fatality rate for both COVID-19 cases as well as other accidents and illnesses that require hospitalization.
Thankfully, many countries have begun implementing strategies to combat the spread of the virus, so this epidemic prediction has already been prevented. But in order to stop the spread of the virus, these strategies need to reduce the R0 below 1 (the effective R0 value over time is called Rt).
In China, the initial containment effort was estimated to reduce the R0 of 2.38 to a Rt of 1.36. Thanks to tighter travel and movement restrictions, it later fell to 0.98. These numbers include both confirmed cases and the estimated unconfirmed mild and asymptomatic cases. If examining only the impact on the most severe and confirmed cases, the later interventions decreased Rt to 0.36. Using this number as a comparison, we can now estimate the impact of currently implemented intervention strategies in relation to interventions in China over a period of one year from the first case see below:
Data derived from SEIR model: at http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html. Jeremy Rossman
As we can see, reducing Rt to 1.36 still results in over 155 million cases in the US and 32 million cases in the UK. Thats nearly a million fatalities in the US and over 178,000 fatalities in the UK. However, if our current intervention strategies reduce the rate to 0.98, as was done in China, this would dramatically reduce the number of cases, deaths and peak hospitalizations, while also spreading the peak of infection over a longer duration of time.
The graph below shows the predicted number of cases and cumulative fatalities in the US for each day over the coming year, if the current interventions reduce Rt to 0.98. Note that the scale on this graph is in thousands of cases instead of millions of cases as seen above with no intervention taken.
Created using the SEIR model at: http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html with intervention at day 63 reducing Rt to 0.98. Jeremy Rossman using Gabriel Gohs Epidemic Calculator
If we can further reduce Rt to 0.36, we shorten the duration of the outbreak and dramatically reduce cases, hospitalizations and fatalities. But this dramatic reduction may not be possible when factoring in the number of asymptomatic cases seen in China.
Also, each one of these scenarios depends on our already implemented interventions successfully reducing Rt to the indicated value. But the restrictions on travel and personal mobility that China imposed were far greater than those currently in use by the US and the UK. China also employed widespread testing and isolation of even mild cases, which probably played a significant role in reducing Rt. So the interventions in use in the US and UK may lead to a smaller reduction of Rt, perhaps closer to 1.38, as seen early in the China outbreak.
What is clear is that the later we act to reduce the Rt below 1, the greater the cost in illness and death. If our interventions dont bring Rt to 0.98 for a further one, two or three weeks, the case numbers, hospitalizations and fatalities will all increase by two or three times with each week of delay.
Clear messages
At present, there is no way to determine exactly how much our current interventions will reduce Rt. Also, steadily increasing intervention strength will have a larger impact than is reported by this single-step model. But there are still four clear messages:
<ol><li>Regardless of intervention, we will see strong increases in case numbers and fatalities over the coming days to weeks.</li><li>Without strong interventions consisting of preparatory, containment and delaying strategies (as recommended by the WHO), COVID-19 will result in over 1.6 million lives lost in the US alone.</li><li>Each week delaying intervention will increase the number of cases, hospitalizations and fatalities by up to threefold. The earlier and stronger we act, the more lives will be saved. Through strong, rapid intervention it is possible to reduce the number of fatalities below 10,000 in the US and below 1,000 in the UK.</li><li>Even in the best scenarios, case numbers would not fall to more manageable levels for four to six weeks from today, so people should prepare for up to two months of physical distancing and significantly limited movement. This would probably follow with a need for some level of continued distancing and vigorous country-wide surveillance, testing and isolation until a vaccine is available.</li></ol>There are many areas in the US and the UK that at present have very few cases; however, everyone is feeling the impact of closures, lockdowns and physical distancing measures. US President Trump and others have said we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.
While these models are not perfect predictors, they track current trends with high accuracy and show that the impact of more moderate interventions could be devastating. Strong, immediate intervention is necessary to prevent significant loss of lives and to prevent the collapse of health infrastructures.
There is definitely a need to address the long-term socioeconomic impact of these measures and ensure that there is a plan for their gradual phase-out and increased surveillance and testing. But the central message is that these measures could bring each countrys outbreak under control within two months and save thousands to hundreds-of-thousands of lives.

In South Korea, for example, mass testing has been used to try and quickly identify and isolate those with the disease. Testing is also vital to calculate accurate infection and survival rates data that is critical for getting public safety measures right. And as this coronavirus continues to spread, people are being offered tests for sale, either at a high price from private clinics including one for £375, or tests that are not officially approved, or perhaps even fake. So what tests are being used by health officials, how much do they really cost, and what developments are there to come?
What tests are available?
There are two main ways to test for infection with SARS-CoV2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease). The first is a very sensitive test that looks for the RNA of the virus using a technique called RT-PCR. This can detect as little as one virus particle in swabs taken from inside the mouth or nose.

The second type of test measures the antibody responses to the virus in blood serum. There are many virus components that our bodies make many different antibodies against. Some antibody is very useful, and kills the virus or stops infection, and some are less useful, binding to common parts of the virus but without helping our defenses.
Read: [Spain plans to use robots to test 80,000 people a day for the coronavirus]
The test itself is very simple: coat a test tube with a virus mash or ideally purified virus components, then add a tiny amount of a very diluted blood sample from the patient and let any antibodies bind to the test tube. Finally, develop the test to see if any antibodies are present.
At the start of the outbreak, most countries relied on RT-PCR tests because these were fastest to develop. More antibody tests are now becoming available, which will increase reported cases as gaps are filled. Big differences in the groups being tested still make overall numbers between countries hard to compare. The UK was very quick to develop an RT-PCR test and this remains the primary method, using a network of labs doing the same standardized test. This allows for consistent data but has stretched capacity from the vast scale of the outbreak and the speed of its development.
How good are current COVID-19 tests?
RT-PCR is very specific and sensitive. However, once you have recovered the virus is eliminated and these tests can no longer tell if youve been infected. This creates significant uncertainty especially if someone has self-isolated due to mild and unclear symptoms. RT-PCR tests need a laboratory, so it takes time even if the RT-PCR test itself only takes several hours, by the time you add sample collection, transport, and sample processing it can be days before the result is known. Rapid portable RT-PCR machines are the cutting edge of diagnostic technology, and COVID-19 tests are only just becoming available for these machines but even the fastest machines take around two hours. These have been evaluated in the NHS to improve flu treatment.
Antibody typically takes a few weeks to develop against a new infection and lasts much longer in the bloodstream than the virus itself, providing a historical picture of past infections. The first studies suggest this is no different with COVID-19. This type of serology testing is a powerful tool used to check if vaccines work, for example, or to find out if people have encountered an infection.
However, current antibody tests for the novel coronavirus havent fully been tested yet to be sure they are reliable, which is why WHO guidelines recommend RT-PCR testing. Chris Whitty, the UKs chief medical adviser, said that a test that could reliably detect past infection will be transformational. The government recently announced that it had ordered 3.5 million home tests that could soon become available for NHS workers and members of the public once validated. Testing for viral infection hasnt been widely used in the UK before and these types of tests are not easy to use the person will have to somehow add a drop of blood to the test so ultimately they need to also be safe for home use. Saliva-based antibody testing might be possible, but we have even less data than for blood serum.
Pros and cons
While the concept of an antibody test is well established, there are challenges in making and using them. Unlike RT-PCR, antibody measurement takes time to refine and needs viral components to be produced that then have to be purified and standardized. In order to check these tests are useful, very carefully collected sets of patient samples are needed.
An antibody test must be checked with many different samples, not only to understand accuracy, but to know how long after infection the sample becomes positive, and how long it stays positive after the patient has recovered. This has to be done with a lot of different patients because every individual generates a unique set of antibodies.

In contrast, the RT-PCR detection can be assessed by taking a known amount of virus and checking the result. The virus has been grown in laboratories since a few weeks after the first UK patients were identified, so we have had an accurate RT-PCR test for some time. But the labor requirements of overburdened centralized laboratories capable of running large numbers of RT-PCR make it relatively slow and expensive.
Lab testing vs home testing kits
Rapid tests that work like pregnancy tests (but detect antiviral antibody instead of pregnancy hormones) on the other hand, are faster and potentially cheaper but have less accuracy than lab methods.
Instead of a test tube, these tests use specially modified paper. The blood sample flows along with the paper and gives that well-known one line = negative, two lines = positive stripes.
Rapid tests are quick to manufacture and easy to use but have to be carefully designed and validated, which is why they are not approved for use and we havent seen widespread official use yet. Quality control and validation add significant cost to these tests: an unregulated test can be purchased for less than 50p and it might even work compared to a certified rapid test typically costing around £5.
As with vaccines, its absolutely vital that any test is accurate and safe, and that takes time and money. Inaccurate tests in the current outbreak could be devastating imagine if you tested negative, but were infected, and went out and infected more people. Some of these tests have an accuracy of around 80% this has been intensively studied for many important viral infections such as dengue which sounds great, except one in five test results is wrong.
The error varies with the disease. For some infections, tests can give you a positive result if youve not had the coronavirus, because you have antibodies against something similar. For most of these rapid tests, you can read a negative result just because the line is hard to see.
Even if the test works perfectly in the lab test, without training its easy to make an error when using them. Another advantage, then, of lab testing over rapid home tests is improved accuracy. By combining multiple tests, for example against lots of different virus fragments, accuracy can be improved. But this comes at the cost of needing more hands-on time and expert interpretation, not to mention lab equipment.
In development
This contrast between accurate but laborious lab tests vs less accurate but portable rapid tests, is why research groups such as our own at the University of Reading have been working hard to develop novel microbiology and blood testing technology.
One major aim for innovators is to allow multiple laboratory tests to be performed in one small, portable and rapid device. At the same time, increasing the scale of conventional, validated tests, for example by expanding NHS testing capacity, is equally critical to track and trace COVID-19 as the current pandemic develops.
I hope the current urgent need for tests will drive both rapid uptakes of innovative technology, and at the same time boost our capacity to detect microbes and viruses using tried-and-tested laboratory methods.

For now, public health officials are relying on tools like social distancing to minimize the harm of the virus, but in the long term, a COVID-19 vaccine is the best hope of a return to normalcy.
It normally takes a few years to develop a vaccine, but in the face of the coronavirus, biotechnology companies and regulatory agencies are taking aggressive steps to make a COVID-19 vaccine widely available sooner than that.
I study biomanufacturing and synthetic biology, and it is fascinating to watch this unprecedented effort push at the limits of vaccine development. Public and private labs around the world are pursuing cutting-edge vaccine engineering strategies that have never been tested on such a large scale. If these efforts succeed, the vaccine would become an essential tool to fight or prevent future COVID epidemics.
How vaccines work
The first time the body is exposed to a new virus, it takes weeks to build antibodies and other defense mechanisms that will fight it off. This gives the virus plenty of time to replicate and make someone sick.
However, the immune system has memory. If it has encountered a virus before, the body can quickly deploy its defenses against the invader and neutralize the virus before a full infection develops.
Read: [This puzzle game lets you help create a coronavirus vaccine]
This is the idea behind vaccines: give the body an opportunity to build defenses against a virus it may encounter in the future. Not all vaccines produce the same level of immunological preparedness the stronger the initial immune response, the better the vaccine but some preparation is better than none.
Vaccines have been around for nearly 150 years, and until recently, science hasnt fundamentally changed. AP Photo/File
The traditional way of developing a vaccine is to grow and inject patients with inactivated viruses. These dont make you sick, but once exposed to these dead viruses, the immune system will have the weapons to fight off that virus in the futureif it needs to.
Unfortunately, figuring out how to grow a new virus on an industrial scale is complicated, and once done, the process itself is often slow, difficult, and potentially risky. For example, the flu vaccine is produced by growing the virus in millions of chicken eggs. The process takes four months. In addition, when dealing with a virus for which there is no drug or vaccine, it is safer to avoid growing it in large quantities for fear that it might accidentally leak out of the factory and make the situation even worse than it already is.
With the coronavirus literally making time a matter of life and death, nearly 50 public and private labs are turning to newer, safer, and faster methods to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
Protein-based vaccines
Rather than injecting the whole virus, it is possible to vaccinate a person with a single virus component. The pieces most commonly used are proteins from the surface of a virus. If a live virus enters the body, these surface proteins are easily recognized by the immune system. This approach is easier, faster, and safer because the virus protein can be produced in cell cultures.
By using proteins from the surface of the virus, it is possible to vaccinate a person without going through the complicated process of growing a dangerous virus. ayvengo/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images
Two companies, Sanofi and Novawax, are both developing protein vaccines based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the tower-shaped structures on the surface of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Protein-based vaccines, also known as recombinant vaccines, are already used to vaccinate against viral infections like HPV. They are far simpler to produce compared to traditional whole-virus vaccines, but it can still take a year to develop a new process and several weeks to produce the vaccine after the manufacturing process has been developed. The world needs something faster.
Gene-based vaccines
Theoretically, the simplest and fastest way to make a vaccine would be to have a persons own cells produce minute quantities of the viral protein that triggers an immune response. To do that researchers are turning to genetics.
The first genetic approach uses DNA. A single gene that codes for a protein from the coronavirus is injected into the patients cells in the hopes that a small fraction of the DNA molecules will find their way into the cell nucleus. There they would be copied into an RNA molecule which is then read by the cell to produce the viral protein. But it is difficult to get the human body to produce enough protein using this approach. Frequently, very little DNA makes it to the cell nucleus and the cell does not produce the protein in sufficient quantity to trigger a strong enough immune response.
As of yet, there are no DNA vaccines currently approved by the FDA for human use and the success of this method has been limited. But there is a promise. In 2016, several groups developed candidate Zika vaccines using this technology and at least one company, INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing INO-4800, a DNA vaccine candidate for the coronavirus.
The bottleneck of DNA vaccines is getting the DNA to the nucleus to be transcribed into RNA. Vaccines that use RNA directly might be able to overcome this problem. Since RNA is translated into proteins as soon as it enters the cell, this approach results in stronger immune responses than DNA vaccines. However, RNA breaks down faster than DNA.
This has not deterred a number of companies from trying it though. Notable in the U.S. is Moderna, and on March 16, the National Institutes of Health started a clinical trial of Modernas lead coronavirus vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273.
On March 16, 2020, Jennifer Haller of Seattle, Wash., became the first person to try Modernas experimental RNA vaccine. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren
Manufacturing DNA and RNA rely on standardized and fairly simple processes. DNA vaccines are produced in bacteria that grow overnight while RNA vaccines are produced in test tubes using a biochemical reaction that only takes hours. Gene-based vaccines could be produced extremely quickly compared to traditional or protein-based vaccines.
Friendly virus vaccines
The main issue with gene-based vaccines is getting the DNA or RNA to where it needs to be. One elegant way to solve this challenge is to use a harmless virus as a delivery system. Viruses are extremely good at penetrating cells; once inside, a virus with genes from SARS-CoV-2 could use the machinery of the cell to produce proteins to trigger an immune response for the coronavirus.
This technique is being pursued by a few companies around the world. For example, Hong Kong-based CanSino Biologics is inserting the coronavirus gene that codes for the spike protein into an adenovirus. They used this strategy to produce the first government-approved Ebola vaccine, and clinical trials of an engineered adenovirus that would protect against the coronavirus have already started in China.
The production of vaccines delivered by harmless viruses is slower than producing DNA or RNA vaccines because it involves the culture of slow-growing mammal cells. However, like the production of gene-based vaccines, they rely on existing processes that take advantage of viruses that have been optimized for manufacturing.
Containing the epidemic with imperfect vaccines
While the pace of COVID-19 vaccine development is unprecedented, the timeline to mass vaccination still remains uncertain. While the large number of approaches being pursued may give the impression of desperation and confusion, it is actually reassuring. This multipronged approach is a way to hedge the vaccine development bet.
It is unlikely the first vaccines developed will be 100% effective and easy to produce on a massive scale. Realistically, researchers will develop a number of good-enough vaccines that can be produced using different kinds of manufacturing infrastructures. While these vaccines may at first have limited efficacy, the diversity in manufacturing processes will allow companies to make and distribute them quickly, buying time and helping contain the current epidemic and prevent future outbreaks.

In little over three months since the virus was first spotted in mainland China, it has spread to more than 90 countries, infected more than 185,000 people, and taken more than 3,500 lives.
As governments and health organizations scramble to contain the spread of coronavirus, they need all the help they can get, including from artificial intelligence. Though current AI technologies are far from replicating human intelligence, they are proving to be very helpful in tracking the outbreak, diagnosing patients, disinfecting areas, and speeding up the process of finding a cure for COVID-19.
Data science and machine learning might be two of the most effective weapons we have in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.
Tracking the coronavirus outbreak with machine learning
Just before the turn of the year, BlueDot, an artificial intelligence platform that tracks infectious diseases around the world, flagged a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases happening around a market in Wuhan, China. Nine days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement declaring the discovery of a novel coronavirus in a hospitalized person with pneumonia in Wuhan.
BlueDot uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to peruse information from hundreds of sources for early signs of infectious epidemics. The AI looks at statements from health organizations, commercial flights, livestock health reports, climate data from satellites, and news reports. With so much data being generated on coronavirus every day, the AI algorithms can help home in on the bits that can provide pertinent information on the spread of the virus. It can also find important correlations between data points, such as the movement patterns of the people who are living in the areas most affected by the virus.
The company also employs dozens of experts who specialize in a range of disciplines including geographic information systems, spatial analytics, data visualization, computer sciences, as well as medical experts in clinical infectious diseases, travel and tropical medicine, and public health. The experts review the information that has been flagged by the AI and send out reports on their findings.
Combined with the assistance of human experts, BlueDots AI can not only predict the start of an epidemic, but also forecast how it will spread. In the case of COVID-19, the AI successfully identified the cities where the virus would be transferred to after it surfaced in Wuhan. Machine learning algorithms studying travel patterns were able to predict where the people who had contracted coronavirus were likely to travel.
Using computer vision to detect coronavirus infection

You have probably seen the COVID-19 screenings at border crossings and airports. Health officers use thermometer guns and visually check travelers for signs of fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
Now, computer vision algorithms can perform the same at large scale. An AI system developed by Chinese tech giant Baidu uses cameras equipped with computer vision and infrared sensors to predict peoples temperatures in public areas. The system can screen up to 200 people per minute and detect their temperature within a range of 0.5 degrees Celsius. The AI flags anyone who has a temperature above 37.3 degrees. The technology is now in use in Beijings Qinghe Railway Station.
Alibaba, another Chinese tech giant, has developed an AI system that can detect coronavirus in chest CT scans. According to the researchers who developed the system, the AI has a 96-percent accuracy. The AI was trained on data from 5,000 coronavirus cases and can perform the test in 20 seconds as opposed to the 15 minutes it takes a human expert to diagnose patients. It can also tell the difference between coronavirus and ordinary viral pneumonia. The algorithm can give a boost to the medical centers that are already under a lot of pressure to screen patients for COVID-19 infection. The system is reportedly being adopted in 100 hospitals in China.
A separate AI developed by researchers from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company, and the China University of Geosciences purportedly shows 95-percent accuracy on detecting COVID-19 in chest CT scans. The system is a deep learning algorithm trained on 45,000 anonymized CT scans. According to a preprint paper published on medRxiv, the AIs performance is comparable to expert radiologists.
Robots at the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19
One of the main ways to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to reduce contact between infected patients and people who have not contracted the virus. To this end, several companies and organizations have engaged in efforts to automate some of the procedures that previously required health workers and medical staff to interact with patients.
Chinese firms are using drones and robots to perform contactless delivery and to spray disinfectants in public areas to minimize the risk of cross-infection. Other robots are checking people for fever and other COVID-19 symptoms and dispensing free hand sanitizer foam and gel.
Inside hospitals, robots are delivering food and medicine to patients and disinfecting their rooms to obviate the need for the presence of nurses. Other robots are busy cooking rice without human supervision, reducing the number of staff required to run the facility.
In Seattle, doctors used a robot to communicate with and treat patients remotely to minimize exposure of medical staff to infected people.
AI is speeding up drug research
At the end of the day, the war on the novel coronavirus is not over until we develop a vaccine that can immunize everyone against the virus. But developing new drugs and medicine is a very lengthy and costly process. It can cost more than a billion dollars and take up to 12 years. Thats the kind of timeframe we dont have as the virus continues to spread at an accelerating pace.
Fortunately, AI can help speed up the process. DeepMind, the AI research lab acquired by Google in 2014, recently declared that it has used deep learning to find new information about the structure of proteins associated with COVID-19. This is a process that could have taken many more months.
Understanding protein structures can provide important clues to the coronavirus vaccine formula. DeepMind is one of several organizations who are engaged in the race to unlock the coronavirus vaccine. It has leveraged the result of decades of machine learning progress as well as research on protein folding.
Its important to note that our structure prediction system is still in development and we cant be certain of the accuracy of the structures we are providing, although we are confident that the system is more accurate than our earlier CASP13 system, DeepMinds researchers wrote on the AI labs website. We confirmed that our system provided an accurate prediction for the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure shared in the Protein Data Bank, and this gave us confidence that our model predictions on other proteins may be useful.
Although its too early to tell whether were headed in the right direction, the efforts are commendable. Every day saved in finding the coronavirus vaccine can save hundredsor thousandsof lives.

Ordinarily one would assume the delay is thanks to unfinished development, and Naughty Dog admits its not done with the game yet.

That said, this is the first weve heard of a game release being delayed thanks to the global pandemic. Jason Schreier of Kotaku said on Twitter that its likely the challenge of getting physical copies manufactured right now is causing the delay.
 TLOUII was on track for May, multiple devs say. The primary reason for the delay is the challenge of printing, shipping, and selling physical games right nowGoing remote has not stopped those still working on the game (such as QA) from crunching. Hopefully this delay helps

Speaking of Kotaku, a recent report on Naughty Dog revealed that its allegedly pushing employees very hard to get the game out of the door, and is notorious in the industry for crunch (overworking employees close to release time in order to meet developmental milestones). The studios original delay did nothing to alleviate the problem, and Schreier also noted that employees are still having to participate in this practice despite working remotely.

Opelika: Bennie G. Adkins, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism during the Vietnam War, died from complications from COVID-19. The Bennie Adkins Foundation announced the death on social media Friday. He was 86. Adkins served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army, with 13 of those years spent as a Green Beret. He was deployed to Vietnam three times and awarded the Medal of Honor in 2014 for heroism in a 1966 battle. According to the Medal of Honor citation, Adkins carried wounded soldiers to safety sometimes drawing fire on himself to allow the wounded to be rescued and fought off waves of attacking forces. Following retirement in 1978 at the rank of command sergeant major, he graduated from Troy University and founded an accounting firm in Alabama. He lived in Opelika.
Alaska
Juneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said Alaskans soon could be making appointments at barbershops and nail salons again, as the state looks to further reopen parts of the economy shut down or restricted because of coronavirus concerns. Dunleavy said Monday that details are expected this week. Other areas he said were being looked at include restaurants and retail shops, businesses he said employ many people and could put in place safety protocols while meeting demand for services. He said Alaskans will be asked to continue washing their hands, cleaning surfaces, maintaining social distance and wearing masks, particularly when shopping. The state feels pretty good about its numbers and its health care capacity, equipment and ability to track cases, he said. The state has reported at least 321 cases of COVID-19, with 161 of those cases recovered and nine deaths.
Arizona
Phoenix: Banner Health is setting up makeshift grocery stores for workers on the front lines tending to coronavirus patients. The provider announced Monday that select metro Phoenix hospitals will have on-site locations where health care workers can pick up provisions. Fruits, vegetables, bread, dairy products and eggs are among the essentials that will be available to physicians, nurses and other staff at a discounted price. Banner officials say they hope to ease the burden for workers who are putting in especially long shifts. The facilities that will offer groceries are in Queen Creek, Glendale, Scottsdale and Phoenix. In Mesa, Banner Desert Medical Center will instead have grocery boxes available to buy. Arizona-based Banner Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care systems nationwide, owns and operates 28 acute-care hospitals.
Arkansas
Little Rock: Nearly a third of the inmates at a state prison have tested positive for coronavirus, state health officials said Monday. About 600 inmates in the Cummins Unit tested positive for the virus, an increase of about 250 from a day earlier, state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said. Prison officials announced the first case at the facility a little over a week ago. Smith said the department has completed most of its testing of inmates at the prison. A health department spokeswoman said the agency has tested more than 1,000 inmates and is awaiting results from 25 more. Until we have completely interrupted chains of transmission in the prison, Im not going to say its over, Smith said. Once we know whos positive, whos negative, whos exposed, whos not exposed, then we can begin moving people around, and that, I would say, is the beginning of containment.

Los Angeles: An estimated 320,000 adults in Los Angeles County may have been infected with coronavirus, according to preliminary results of a study that suggests the illness is far more widespread than current testing shows and the death rate is much lower. The study conducted April 10-11 by the county and the University of Southern California estimated that approximately 4.1% of the countys adult population of 8 million has antibodies to the virus. When adjusted for margin of error, the infection rate ranged from 2.8% to 5.6%, or about 220,000 to 440,000 adults. The study, which was criticized by some outside experts, follows other research that has suggested more people have had coronavirus than previously determined through testing many without symptoms or without feeling ill enough to seek a test. But it also means more people have been silent carriers of the virus that has killed more than 1,200 people in California.
Colorado
Denver: Colorado will let its statewide stay-at-home order expire next week, allow a gradual reopening of nonessential businesses, and permit nonelective surgical procedures and other activity suspended by the coronavirus fight as long as strict social distancing and other protective measures continue, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Polis credited widespread compliance with social distancing and shelter-in-place orders for state information that suggests COVID-19 hospitalizations are leveling off, allowing the most severe restrictions imposed last month to expire April 27. He urged residents who can work at home to keep doing so and all to stay at home as much as possible, avoid large gatherings, and wear masks and other protective gear. Details on specific measures will be released this week, Polis said. State and local authorities are empowered to reimpose restrictions in response to health crises, he said. 
Connecticut
Hartford: The state has teamed up with a group of scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and other research institutions whove created a new app that will provide more information about the spread of COVID-19 as officials prepare to eventually reopen Connecticut. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state is the first to officially partner with the developers of the HowWeFeel.org app, which enables residents to report daily about how theyre feeling and their symptoms. He encouraged people to download the app, noting it does not require logging in or sharing any personal information, such as name or email address. Its one of several ways the state plans to use technology to help inform officials on how and when to slowly restart parts of society. For example, Lamont said the state has received 3,500 smart thermometers that will upload data about residents temperatures to a cloud-based system.
Delaware
Dover: A state panel has drastically lowered official government revenue estimates as the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc with the national and state economies. The Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council on Monday lowered its revenue estimate for this year by $416 million, or 9%, compared to its March estimate. This years revenue total is currently predicted to be almost 6% less than the amount collected last year. The panel also lowered its revenue estimates for the fiscal year starting July 1 by $273 million, or 6%, compared to its March estimate. The downward revisions were largely due to significant declines in estimates for personal income taxes and corporate income taxes. But estimates were also down significantly for lottery and gross receipts tax revenue. The only increase was in insurance taxes and fees, along with a slight uptick in dividends and interest for the current year.
District of Columbia
Washington: Numbers from the D.C. Office of Unified Communications show a spike in calls for noise complaints and mass gatherings once the coronavirus pandemic came to the area, WUSA-TV reports. Overall, the amount of 311 calls handled by the city is up 7% since the city began modifying operations the week of March 15. According to statistics from OUC, dispatched noise complaints soared 17% beginning in March and continuing into April. Following the spread of the virus, OUC dispatchers also saw 2,150 service requests come in regarding concerns with mass gatherings, and 195 reported complaints of nonessential businesses being open or not in compliance with social gathering parameters. Dispatchers saw a 24% spike in 311 calls the week of March 15. People were asking questions like where are the tests, are schools closed, are they going to give out meals, Director of Unified Communications Karima Holmes said.

Tampa: Six Super Bowl rings may get you special treatment in a lot of places, but former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady learned Monday that it wont get you anything when youre caught working out in a park that is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said during a news briefing that the new Buccaneers quarterback was spotted working out by himself at a park downtown. A member of staff patrol went over to tell him he had to leave, and she recognized the man to be the 42-year-old Brady. The City of Tampa tweeted from its page Monday, Sorry @TomBrady! Our @tampaparksrec team cant wait to welcome you and our entire community back with even bigger smiles until then, stay safe and stay home as much as you can to help flatten the curve. The four-time Super Bowl MVP left the New England Patriots and signed a two-year, $50 million contract with the Bucs in free agency, joining a team with the worst winning percentage in league history. 
Georgia
Pooler: Americas Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia will host a drive-thru emergency food distribution event at 9 a.m. Wednesday at the Tanger Outlet Centers in the city. It will be a first-come, first-served distribution while supplies last for residents of Pooler, Executive Director Mary Jane Crouch said in a press release Monday. In the light of the COVID-19 virus, strict precautionary measures will be taken to keep staff and the public safe during the distribution. Clients must remain in their cars and have a space cleared in the trunk of their vehicle available for the Georgia National Guard to load a box of nonperishable food, produce and protein into their vehicle. We can only provide one box per vehicle, and no exceptions will be made, Crouch said. A variety of nonperishable goods and fresh produce will be distributed.
Hawaii
Honolulu: The federal coronavirus relief funds for Hawaii residents are not expected to cover a single month of expenses because of the states high cost of living, an economic analysis found. The one-time, $1,200 payments from the governments coronavirus rescue package are likely to be less effective in Hawaii because the average cost of living is 20% higher than the national average, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Beth Giesting, director of the nonpartisan Hawaii Budget and Policy Center, said when accounting for the local cost of living, the $1,200 payment is more like $960 elsewhere in the U.S. In no case does it cover a full months expenses, she said. How far the money goes depends on location. On Oahu, the most expensive island, $1,200 does not cover even half the average monthly expenses for a single person, Giesting said.
Idaho
Boise: With students completing school work remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, officials say more youths are filling their days by doing farm labor and other agricultural jobs. Educators and farm-worker advocates are worried that could take a toll on students education and health, the Idaho Statesman and Idaho Ed News report. The majority of child work-related fatalities occur in agricultural jobs, according to a 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, as kids can encounter pesticide exposure, dangerous equipment or extreme temperatures. This is definitely a concern, said Sarah Seamount, migrant education coordinator for the Idaho State Department of Education. Although these students are not at school, they are still in school and are expected to continue their education during this soft closure, just like all Idaho public school students.

Chicago: The number of black Chicago residents becoming infected with the coronavirus and of those dying of the disease remains disproportionately high, city officials said Monday. Black residents made up about 46% of the 12,571 confirmed tests for the coronavirus and about 60% of the 500 deaths in the city linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, despite making up 30% of the citys population. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city and neighborhood organizations working to share information about the virus and preventing its spread are focused on three neighborhoods: Auburn Gresham, South Shore and Austin. Health conditions that are more common among African Americans can make people more vulnerable to the virus, including diabetes and asthma. Experts also have pointed to higher uninsured rates and poorer access to health care.
Indiana
Indianapolis: The governor said Monday that he was easing restrictions on hospitals from performing elective surgeries even as the state health commissioner remained concerned about whether coronavirus infections were slowing. Gov. Eric Holcomb said while he was extending the statewide stay-at-home order until May 1, hospitals would be allowed starting Tuesday to resume procedures to diagnose and treat medical conditions. A halt to elective procedures had been ordered last month to help preserve hospital equipment and protective gear if needed to treated people seriously ill with COVID-19 respiratory infections. State officials have not reported shortages of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators even as Indianas coronavirus death toll has topped 550 in little more than five weeks since the states first known death.

Iowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Monday that the states meatpacking plants must stay open despite coronavirus outbreaks that have sickened hundreds of workers, saying shutting them down would be devastating for farmers and the nations food supply. Reynolds said at a news conference that the virus spreads quickly and easily at the plants because so many workers are in close proximity, acknowledging we will continue to see clusters of positive cases in them. But these are also essential businesses and an essential workforce, she said. Coronavirus outbreaks at Tyson Foods pork plants in Columbus Junction and Waterloo and a National Beef plant in Tama have contributed to a surge in positive cases in Iowa in recent days. Tyson resumed limited operations Tuesday at its plant in Columbus Junction, where more than 200 workers have become infected and at least two have died.
Kansas
Topeka: The coronavirus has arrived at a third correctional facility as the states largest prison outbreak grows to include nearly 90 positive cases. Kansas Department of Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda said in a news release that one staff member tested positive Monday at the Topeka Correctional Facility, which is the states only all-female prison, with a capacity of 948. Health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine who has been in close contact with the worker. The largest outbreak is at the Lansing Correction Facility, where 47 staff and 40 inmates are infected. An inmate at a work-release facility in Wichita also tested positive, prompting corrections officials to move 113 prisoners earlier this month to Lansing, where they are being quarantined. With advocacy groups demanding action, Gov. Laura Kelly has said efforts are underway to identify inmates who are close to finishing their sentences and can be released.
Kentucky
Louisville: A legal organization representing an area church that filed a lawsuit against Gov. Andy Beshear is calling on churches around the country to follow Maryville Baptists lead and reopen early next month. Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance in cases involving evangelical causes, has dubbed May 3 as ReOpen Church Sunday, according to a news release from the group, and is encouraging churchgoers to fill the pews as they did earlier in April at Maryville Baptist Church in Bullitt County. The call to action notes that families who attend services, which are currently banned in Kentucky as the commonwealth fights the spread of the coronavirus under Beshears healthy at home restrictions, should practice social distancing and include appropriate measures of sanitization, as well as including other options like reduced seating, live videos online and parking lot services.

Baton Rouge: Authorities arrested a pastor on an assault charge Tuesday after he admitted he drove his church bus toward a man who has been protesting his decision to hold mass gatherings in defiance of public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic. The police department in Central, a suburb of Baton Rouge, said on Facebook that Tony Spell, pastor of Life Tabernacle Church, turned himself in and was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and improper backing. Spell was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish prison, where about 70 of his parishioners, dressed in their Sunday best, arrived in church buses to show support. Gathering in a parking lot across the street, they stood close to each other, praying and singing hymns. Trey Bennett, the protester Spell is accused of assaulting, also showed up at the jail, carrying his protest sign, which said Close this church on one side and Danger: coronavirus incubator on the other.
Maine
Augusta: Social distancing rules imposed to protect against the new coronavirus also appear to be reducing incidence of the flu. The number of flu diagnoses in Maine increased by 184 in the three weeks since late March when most of the social distancing policies began in the state. The number of flu cases grew by 1,812 during that same period a year earlier, the Bangor Daily News reports. What those data suggest is that by staying inside and abiding by Gov. (Janet) Mills recommendations and rules, weve not only gotten a hold of COVID-19, but weve also dropped the number of influenza cases as well, Maine Center for Disease Control Director Nirav Shah said. The state has still seen more flu cases overall this year than last. But the number of flu-related hospitalizations has dropped noticeably. As for the new coronavirus, Maine has now recorded more than 875 cases and 35 deaths from COVID-19.

Annapolis: The state has dramatically boosted its testing capacity for the new coronavirus with a shipment of 500,000 tests from a South Korean company, the governor announced Monday, noting his Korean-born wife played a major role in championing the $9 million purchase. As states have scoured the world for testing supplies, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he asked wife Yumi Hogan on March 28 to help negotiate the purchase, tapping into the goodwill she has sought to foster between the state and South Korea. Hogan said 22 days of negotiations led to the shipments delivery by air Saturday. The governor noted that President Donald Trump had told state officials the states need to lead on boosting their testing capacity. The purchase was cited at Mondays press briefing at the White House, with Trump opining that he didnt believe it was necessary. Administration officials have been pushing governors to step up testing, while some governors have said testing infrastructure is inadequate.
Massachusetts
Boston: School buildings in the state will remain closed through the end of the academic year, but remote learning will continue, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. There hasnt been any strong guidance about how to operate schools safely as the state works to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the Republican governor said. We believe therefore that students cannot safety return to school, he said, adding that all non-emergency child care programs will remain closed until June 29. Bakers announcement came a day after Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, suggested schools would not reopen until September. I also think next year when school comes back in September, it could be a very different looking situation in the classrooms, Walsh said Monday.
Michigan
Lansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said the state is working with major retailers to open more drive-thru sites to test as many as 1,000 people a day for the coronavirus, especially people who dont have symptoms but still are required to work outside their home. Robust testing is essential to have confidence about our strategies for safely reducing risk and reengaging sectors of our economy, Whitmer said. She said Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are part of the plan to open eight test sites across the state. Whitmer cautioned, however, that theres a shortage of swabs and chemicals needed to complete tests. If labs had all the supplies they needed, 11,300 tests a day could be performed, the governor said. The reality is were about half of that because we need additional swabs and reagents, Whitmer said. However, those supplies are in demand globally, and we are competing to get them and working incredibly hard so that we can ramp up to that 11,300 capacity and hopefully beyond.
Minnesota
Minneapolis: Muslims in south Minneapolis will be able to maintain safe physical distance during the call to prayer throughout the holy month of Ramadan. The call to prayer will be broadcast by speaker five times each day in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood to allow residents to pray together starting the first day of Ramadan and lasting throughout the holy holiday. Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after the community requested the service. The Council on American-Islamic Relations paid for the audio equipment for the broadcast from the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque. The broadcasts are expected to reach thousands of residents while allowing residents to maintain safe physical distance for prayer during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, Frey said the broadcast should offer a measure of stability and reassure our entire city that we are all very much in this together. Ramadan starts Thursday and ends May 23.

Jackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he believes the state is reaching a plateau in the increase of new coronavirus cases, and he will consider in coming days how the state should ease into reopening parts of its economy. We are confident that our health care system is not going to be overwhelmed, the Republican said during a news conference, joined by the state health officer. Many businesses deemed nonessential have been closed, and claims for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed. Reeves announced last week that starting Monday, some closed businesses, including clothing stores and florists, could sell items for delivery or curbside pickup. Some smaller businesses had said they were losing money to big chain stores that have remained open. The state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said Monday: Big box stores are still pretty crowded. It makes me very nervous. And Im not seeing a lot of folks wearing masks in the community, necessarily.
Missouri
Columbia: The state filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nations officials are to blame for the global pandemic. The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the states top prosecutor, alleges Chinese officials are responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians. The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease, Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement. They must be held accountable for their actions. Lawsuits against other countries are typically fruitless because U.S. law generally prohibits them with rare exceptions, said Ashley Deeks, an international law expert at the University of Virginia School of Law. Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a stunt by a Republican attorney general who is up for reelection this year.

Great Falls: A cloistered order of nuns, devout in their vows of poverty and seclusion, the Poor Clares are not often seen in public. For the vast majority of their time, the six sisters remain in anonymity, quietly praying that the blessings of God be granted to all, even during the most common of times. But these are not common times. For the first time in their 20-year history in the city, the Poor Clares have emerged from their monastery to raise their hands in blessing over Great Falls and sing the blessing of St. Clare. We wanted to bless the city, especially the health care workers, Sister Judith Crosby said. We see the city, and we are very aware of its needs and continually pray for them, added Sister Jane Sorenson. Its been strongly on our minds for as long as weve been here. But at this point in time with the pandemic, we just believe it would be good for us to (be) visible, let people know that they are in our prayers.
Nebraska
Lincoln: Five more people have died from COVID-19, bringing the states total deaths to 33 since the new coronavirus outbreak this year, health officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that three of the deaths reported Monday were in a hard-hit area of south-central Nebraska. They included a woman in her 60s from Hamilton County and a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s, both from Hall County. The other two deaths came from the Omaha area in Douglas County, where a man in his 40s and a man in his 70s both with underlying health conditions died of the disease. Word of the new cases came after Gov. Pete Ricketts announced Monday that he will lift the states ban on elective surgeries for hospitals that have at least 30% of their beds, intensive-care unit space and ventilators available. Hospitals must also have at least two weeks worth of personal protective equipment in stock.

Las Vegas: A strip club business has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Small Business Administration after not receiving money from the $2 trillion federal coronavirus aid bill. Little Darlings owner Jason Mohney has struggled obtaining emergency funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act after Congress grouped the business into the category of operations of a prurient sexual nature, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Mohney argues the exclusion is discriminatory toward a class of workers who perform a legal and legitimate service through the Flint, Michigan-based company, which operates 200 exotic dance clubs in Las Vegas and multiple other cities. Not all companies in the sexual business have been denied funding. Bellas Hacienda Ranch brothel owner Madam Bella Cummins received a notification that her funding application was approved for about $70,000, but the federal program had run out of money by then.
New Hampshire
Manchester: Catholic Medical Center, one of the states largest hospitals, is furloughing hundreds of workers as it loses millions of dollars a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. The hospital said Tuesday that it will put 423 workers, or 13% of its workforce, on a 60-day furlough, starting Saturday. An additional 914 workers will have their hours reduced, leaders at the vice president level and above are taking a 15% pay cut, and executive directors are taking a 5% cut. Like other facilities, the hospital has eliminated elective procedures and scaled back outpatient visits to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 patients, to conserve protective equipment, and to protect other patients and staff. The hospital lost $11 million in March and expects to lose up to $70 million by July. Last week, the company that runs Elliot Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center announced 650 workers would be furloughed.
New Jersey
Trenton: The states COVID-19 death toll saw its biggest spike yet Tuesday, climbing by 379 deaths, Gov. Phil Murphy said. The increase comes as the number of new cases has been leveling off, the first-term Democrat said at a news conference. New Jersey has had 4,753 deaths from the virus and more than 92,000 cases, up from about 89,000. Despite some positive signs, like the leveling off of cases and the increasing time it takes for the number of people with COVID-19 to double, Murphy said there are still weeks to go of social distancing. We cannot rush to reopen anything and risk undoing all the extraordinary work youve done so far, Murphy said. Murphy also on Tuesday toured the states third and newest field hospital to open during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Atlantic City Convention Center field hospital is aimed at alleviating pressure on local hospitals and will treat non-coronavirus patients in 258 beds.
New Mexico
Santa Fe: A team of national defense scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory that studies contagions with award-winning accuracy has developed its own U.S. forecast for the spread of the coronavirus. Its one model that states are utilizing as they consider the duration of directives on social distancing and restrictions on business. With support from the U.S. Energy Department, the Los Alamos model builds upon a decade of past experience in forecasting contagions, including the seasonal flu, the Ebola virus and mosquito-borne Chikungunya. Last year Los Alamos statisticians beat out more than 20 teams in a CDC competition aimed at improving flu forecasting using supercomputing power. The labs Dante model was most successful in predicting the peak and short-term intensity of the unfolding flu season and became the basis for the new COVID-19 model.

New York: Hospitals in parts of the state will be able to conduct outpatient elective surgeries again, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday as he pledged to consider regional differences when reopening New Yorks outbreak-stalled economy. The governor said elective treatments will be allowed in places where the outbreak is less severe. Were going to allow it in those hospitals and counties in the state that do not have a COVID issue or we wouldnt need their beds in case of a surge, Cuomo said. The hospital restrictions will remain in effect in New York City and suburban Westchester and Rockland counties, as well as Albany, Dutchess and Erie counties, he said. By Monday, more than 250,000 people in the state had tested positive for COVID-19 a milestone figure that likely undercounts infected residents by a significant margin. People in New York City, a worldwide hotspot, were advised to seek testing only if they were ill enough to possibly require hospitalization.

Fort Bragg: Its become a competition for the soldiers of 647th Quartermaster Company to see who can crank out the most face masks during a shift to protect against the coronavirus. The parachute rigging unit is essential to airborne operations at Fort Bragg. On any given day, the soldiers shed is filled with paratroopers in red ball caps, busy packing parachutes and readying supplies for jumps. While that work continues, soldiers across the room are laser-focused on tiny pins and buzzing sewing machines. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, riggers are now making cloth face masks to fight the virus for personnel around the sprawling Army base. Initially, Company Commander Captain Anthony Williams set a goal for his soldiers to produce 600 masks a week. With the soldiers and their adaptability and their resilience, were actually producing 600 masks a day, Williams said. North Carolina State University donated 4,000 meters of unwoven material thats being used to construct new personal protective equipment.
North Dakota
Grand Forks: A local company is working with universities and a medical school on using unmanned aerial vehicles in the fight against the coronavirus. SkySkopes, based in Grand Forks, has launched demonstrations to show a variety of ways in which its drones could be used in the pandemic. KFGO reports SkySkopes CEO and President Matt Dunlevy says the drones can deliver supplies to hospital, check peoples temperatures from the air and even sanitize playground equipment. The company said its working with the University of North Dakotas medical school and its Center for Innovation as well as North Dakota State University and Grand Forks County. The company had planned to conduct testing in Hillsboro but met with some opposition. City Commission President Terry Sando said a small number of people expressed concerns about the drone testing.

Columbus: Schools across the state will stay closed for the remainder of the school year while classes continue remotely, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday. DeWine, who was the first governor in the nation to shutter schools statewide, said his latest decision stems from concern for the continued safety of students, teachers and communities. He said returning students to their classrooms could lead to new cases of COVID-19. DeWine said teachers and administrators also worried that another disruption to a school year already interrupted by the coronavirus might negatively affect students, who need continuity. We have to think about the risk to teachers, students and our communities, DeWine said. The governor said no decision has been made about the fall but said a blend of in-person and online learning might be an option for districts.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitts attempt to ban abortions during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be enforced, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Charles Goodwin issued a preliminary injunction late Monday after abortion providers sued Stitt over the ban. The injunction replaces a temporary restraining order that the same judge issued last week that allowed most abortions to continue. The injunction ensures abortions can be performed in Oklahoma while the case continues in federal court. Stitts office didnt immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said he intends to appeal the decision. Stitt attempted to ban abortions as part of a prohibition on elective surgeries aimed at preserving personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, gowns and gloves, during the public health crisis.
Oregon
Salem: The governors office on Monday circulated its own version of a three-phase federal guideline to lift restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, including allowing child care facilities and possibly restaurants to reopen in the first phase. The Trump administrations guidelines say there first must be downward trajectories, during a 14-day period, of influenza-like illnesses, COVID-19-like cases, documented cases or positive tests as a percent of total tests, as well as robust testing and contact tracing. Oregon, however, has some counties with no or few COVID-19 cases. The draft circulating among state leaders says Oregon will likely use modified metrics, especially for rural counties with small numbers. Democratic Gov. Kate Browns draft plan, which comes as Republicans in the Legislature ramp up pressure on her to lift economic restrictions in rural areas, offers no time frame, saying experience in other countries and modeling says reducing social distancing too quickly will create a spike in cases.
Pennsylvania
Philadelphia: Transporting bodies from a hospital to the medical examiners office in the back of a pickup truck is unacceptable, a city Department of Public Health spokesman said after images of a contractor stepping on the bodies while unloading them from the truck bed were captured over the weekend. A photographer for The Philadelphia Inquirer captured images of the delivery of five or six bodies that were enclosed in white body bags and covered by mats in the back of the pickup truck Sunday afternoon. The bodies were delivered to a facility where the city has secured several refrigerated trailers to help with an increased need for body storage from hospitals and private funeral homes. James Garrow, a spokesman for Philadelphias public health department, said Tuesday that the delivery was an isolated occurrence that was not up to the standard transportation protocols.
Rhode Island
Providence: Brown University has made available at no cost 700 single-occupancy dorm rooms for front-line workers who need a safe place to stay during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Tuesday. The rooms are for health care workers, nursing home employees, public safety personnel and others at high risk of contracting the virus who do not want to worry about infecting family members by staying at home, the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. The rooms are not for people who have tested positive for the disease and need to stay in isolation. Laundry and meal service are available for a fee, she said. The Rhode Island Department of Health reported 394 additional cases of COVID-19 and 16 new deaths Tuesday. The 394 new cases, a single-day high since the pandemic began, bring the total number of positive cases in the state to 5,500. The state now has 171 deaths.
South Carolina

Columbia: Some beaches in the state reopened Tuesday, with mayors and other leaders enthusiastically telling people to soak in the sun while being careful and continuing coronavirus precautions like social distancing. But other beach towns took a more cautious approach, citing federal guidelines for determining whether the spread of the virus had slowed that have not yet been met in South Carolina. Part of the struggle for local governments is determining where the state is in terms of the pandemics spread. State health officials quietly changed their estimate of the peak over the weekend from April 30 to sometime the week before. But while the number of new COVID-19 cases from April 12 to April 19 dropped by nearly 17% in South Carolina, the number of coronavirus tests done over that same period fell more than 27%, according to data from the Department of Health and Environmental Control. 
South Dakota
Jefferson: Racing promoters plan to go ahead with an event at a track in Jefferson this weekend with some modifications for social distancing. Sprint car promoter and racing veteran Terry McCarl is bringing the Open Wheel Nationals to Park Jefferson Speedway on Saturday. But the drivers wont be racing for a packed house. Instead only 700 tickets have been sold for a speedway that seats more than 4,000, KELO-TV reports. McCarl said that should give each person more than 6 feet of distance from the next fan. Concessions will be limited with distancing marks on the ground. And attendees are encouraged to bring a covering for their faces. Gov. Kristi Noem is one of the few governors who hasnt issued a statewide stay-at-home order.
Tennessee
A boot store and a bar are closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn. Some of Tennessees biggest cities are not making promises about starting to reopen their economies by Gov. Bill Lees goal of May 1, saying they are going to let data, not dates, dictate their roll-outs.

Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee announced Monday that businesses across the majority of the state will begin reopening as early as next week. The Republican governor said his mandatory safer-at-home order will expire April 30, which will pave the way for 89 out of the states 95 counties to begin opening businesses. However, Lees announcement does not apply to the states counties with the largest cities, including Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Shelby and Sullivan counties areas that are not overseen by Tennessees Department of Health but have their own public health districts. Some businesses will be allowed to reopen as early as April 27, but its unclear exactly which ones will be granted such clearance. Lee told reporters such details would be finalized by his economy recovery team later this week. Most state parks will reopen Friday.

Austin: Most state parks reopened Monday as the state began what Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said will be a gradual unraveling of restrictions that were put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Eager hikers and fishermen lined up early as parks reopened for the first time since temporarily closing April 7 as part of statewide social distancing restrictions. At Enchanted Rock State Natural Area in the Hill Country, about 120 people made reservations Monday to enter one of Texas most popular park destinations, park ranger Tina Johnson said. Visitors had to remain in their car while grabbing trail maps, and signs reminded them to wear masks and keep 6 feet apart from other hikers. In Houston, dozens of families flocked early to Sheldon Lake State Park, where most but not all visitors wore masks as required. 
Utah
Salt Lake City: All but one of the states 28 confirmed coronavirus deaths have been people over the age of 55, health officials said Monday. That breakdown mirrors national trends: More than 9 in 10 of the 15,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States were in that age group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest reported death among Utah residents was a 68-year-old man who was serving as a senior missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Allen Dee Pace, of Willard, had been serving with his wife in Detroit when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in early April, said church spokesman Daniel Woodruff. He died Saturday. Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said 27 of the states 28 deaths have been people over the age of 55. The vast majority had underlying health conditions and died in hospitals, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said.

Marshfield: The board of the struggling Vermont State Colleges system on Monday considered a plan to close three campuses because of added financial troubles brought by the coronavirus outbreak, while earlier in the day students and other critics protested in a car parade through Montpelier. Under a proposal announced by Chancellor Jeb Spaulding on Friday, the two campuses of Northern Vermont University in Johnson and Lyndon and the campus of Vermont Technical College in Randolph, which has another campus in Williston, would close. Liberal arts programs in Johnson and Lyndon would be moved to Castleton University. Not every program would be transferable, Spaulding said. The board and chancellor said they received more than 1,000 emails over the weekend from students, faculty and community members, with some painful stories. The schools faculty assemblies and unions voted no confidence in Spaulding, and a petition was started to keep the Northern Vermont University at Lyndon campus open.
Virginia
Charlottesville: Staff at the University of Virginia Medical Center threw away convention to find a way to extend the life of personal protective equipment in the face of the highly communicable and deadly new coronavirus, The Daily Progress reports. With a pandemic raging, staff across the centers departments worked to find ways of extending the life of protective gear as shortages of N95 masks and other equipment used when treating patients grew critical in other parts of the country struck by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Staff wound up playing MacGyver with a robot designed to clean hospital rooms of virulent organisms, turning it into a virus-killing, gear-cleaning, ultraviolet ray gun called Tru-D. Set at maximum power, Tru-D can disinfect hundreds of masks with each 20-minute cycle.

Pasco: The sheriff of a county in eastern Washington state is telling residents he will not enforce Gov. Jay Inslees stay-at-home orders or any guidelines that infringe on your constitutional rights. Franklin County Sheriff J.D. Raymond sent a letter to constituents Monday in which he said he does believe the coronavirus pandemic is real and needs to be dealt with appropriately. I believe that social distancing and taking appropriate and proper steps to slow the spread of the virus and control its transmission is important, Raymond said. But Raymond, who has been sheriff for six years in the county of about 95,000 people whose biggest city is Pasco, also said he believes adults are capable of policing themselves, and we have the capability of adjusting our habits to these trying times. KOMO-TV reports Raymond thinks local businesses and houses of worship can reopen while adhering to strict social distancing standards.
West Virginia
Wheeling: The city responded Monday to a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union that raised concerns with officials plans to clear a homeless encampment. Authorities in Wheeling began efforts last week to remove informal living setups erected in a section of city-owned property after receiving numerous criminal complaints from residents and contractors, The Intelligencer reports. The West Virginia ACLU chapter asked the city Sunday to commit to halting the removal of the encampments and instead establish housing options for the individuals who would be displaced, according to a copy of the letter obtained by news outlets. The organization contended that clearing the camp would go against the statewide shelter-in-place order meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus as well as Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending homeless encampments not be vacated. Wheeling City Manager Robert Herron said Monday that officials were reviewing the concerns but did not say whether they would be addressed, according to news outlets.
Wisconsin
Madison: Republican leaders of the Legislature asked the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court on Tuesday to block an order from Gov. Tony Evers administration extending a stay-at-home order until May 26. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald asked the Supreme Court to take the case directly, a move that would skip lower courts and get a final ruling sooner. Evers on Thursday announced he was directing state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm to extend the order closing most nonessential businesses from April 24 to May 26. Vos and Fitzgerald said Tuesday that there was immense frustration with the extension. They argue that Palm exceeded her authority in issuing it. Evers has said he believes the order was made legally. Vos and Fitzgerald said the order is eroding the economy and liberty of people in the state.

Cheyenne: Flanked by bodyguards wearing virus-protection face masks, Gov. Mark Gordon told about 100 raucous protesters Monday that he didnt know when Wyoming would get back to normal but was talking with state officials about how to reopen businesses. On the one-month mark after his orders to close schools and a variety of businesses to limit the spread of the coronavirus, he came out of the Capitol to engage with the group carrying the U.S. and the Gadsden Dont Tread on Me flags and signs reading Dont Flatten the Economy and Defend Liberty. Gordon began by reading a prayer but didnt quiet the group, who demanded to know what businesses and jobs he thought were essential. Theyre all essential! somebody else shouted before Gordon could answer. Wyomings measures set to run through at least April 30 arent as strict as those in neighboring states that have issued statewide stay-at-home orders, Gordon pointed out.

Its gone from a release date of May 29 to TBD.
The game development studio made a statement on Twitter stating that due to logistics beyond our control, it cant launch the game. It added, Were hoping that this wont be a long delay, and well update you as soon as we have new information to share. Sony corroborated the delay and explicitly blamed the coronavirus for the problem, saying the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players deserve.
Update: SIE has made the difficult decision to delay the launch of The Last of Us Part II and Marvel's Iron Man VR until further notice. Logistically, the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players deserve.
 PlayStation (@PlayStation) April 2, 2020
Ordinarily one would assume the delay is thanks to unfinished development, and Naughty Dog admits its not done with the game yet. Game delays seem to be something of a running gag amidst 2020s titles, with several major titles (Cyberpunk 2077, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Marvels Avengers) getting hamstrung one way or another. The Last of Us Part II was already delayed once, having originally been scheduled for release last month.
Read: A Last of Us series is coming to HBO so whats next?
That said, this is the first weve heard of a game release being delayed thanks to the global pandemic. Jason Schreier of Kotaku said on Twitter that its likely the challenge of getting physical copies manufactured right now is causing the delay.
 TLOUII was on track for May, multiple devs say. The primary reason for the delay is the challenge of printing, shipping, and selling physical games right nowGoing remote has not stopped those still working on the game (such as QA) from crunching. Hopefully this delay helps
 Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) April 2, 2020
Speaking of Kotaku, a recent report on Naughty Dog revealed that its allegedly pushing employees very hard to get the game out of the door, and is notorious in the industry for crunch (overworking employees close to release time in order to meet developmental milestones). The studios original delay did nothing to alleviate the problem, and Schreier also noted that employees are still having to participate in this practice despite working remotely.
Theres no word yet on when exactly The Last of Us Part II will eventually arrive Im hoping its some time this year, otherwise the current-gen release and the inevitable Remastered next-gen version might come out on top of each other.

Curiously, Facebook isnt using the same reaction in Messenger, instead opting for a pulsating purple-ish heart.
Its kind of obscured too; you have to first open your reactions by long-pressing on a message, long-press on the heart reaction, then tap okay to enable the new reaction.
Messenger is rolling out a pulsating heart Reaction today so people can show extra love and care to their friends and family.

Montgomery: The state prison system on Wednesday reported its fourth case of COVID-19 in an inmate. The Department of Corrections said the inmate at the Elba Community Based Facility/Community Work Center was moved to the Easterling Correctional Facility and placed in an isolation cell, where hell receive medical treatment. Inmates at the Elba facility have been quarantined. The prison system has so far reported four COVID-19 cases and one prisoner death. Inmate advocates and health experts have expressed concerns that the states overcrowded prisons would become a breeding ground for a deadly outbreak and urged additional changes. Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said the prison system is distributing masks and taking other precautions. Alabamians for Fair Justice, an advocacy group, donated more than 3,200 bars of antibacterial soap and other hygiene supplies to the system, which said the items will be distributed to inmates deemed at high risk.
Alaska
Juneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has proposed disbursing more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid through a process that would not require the Legislature to reconvene. A legislative attorney, however, has raised questions with that approach. Dunleavy has asked the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee to review his plan to distribute funds to help municipalities, nonprofits, small businesses, schools and other areas. State law lays out a process by which a governor can submit to the committee plans to accept and spend on a budget item additional federal or other program funds. Even if the committee disagrees, a governor can proceed. But Megan Wallace, director of Legislative Legal Services, raised concerns with use of the process for the federal aid in a memo responding to questions from Sen. Bill Wielechowski. 
Arizona
Phoenix: Nearly $18 million of federal funding provided to the city in response to the coronavirus outbreak would pay for housing support that includes renting hotel rooms for homeless people and providing aid to other low-income people. Mayor Kate Gallego said the City Councils unanimous approval Tuesday for use of a grant is the largest investment in fighting homelessness in the citys history. The citys plans for spending the money include renting about 100 rooms at a hotel to house 100 seniors or people with chronic health issues who are at higher risk for COVID-19. Other parts of the citys plan include more shelter beds and housing support. The city estimates it could reach 200 individuals and 555 families experiencing homelessness.

Little Rock: Next week the state will ease its ban on elective surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic, and an announcement could also come on the lifting of restrictions on other businesses, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday. The state will allow hospitals and clinics to resume some elective surgeries starting Monday, Hutchinson said. The state had ordered health care providers to reschedule procedures that could be safely postponed. State Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said the providers will have to meet certain conditions, including requiring patients to be tested for the virus 48 hours before the procedure. Smith said the the ban is being lifted for procedures that dont require an overnight stay in the hospital. It was not immediately clear whether the order would clear the way for the resumption of surgical abortions, which the state has halted.

Sacramento: The California Highway Patrol said Wednesday that it is temporarily banning rallies at the Capitol and other state facilities because of the pandemic. The change in policy came after hundreds of protesters gathered on the Capitol grounds in Sacramento on Monday, many without wearing masks or following recommendations to remain more than 6 feet apart to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The same group had planned additional rallies in coming days against Gov. Gavin Newsoms orders that people remain at home except for essential activities. The CHP said it was caught by surprise when protesters ignored public safety recommendations. The event permit was issued with the understanding that the protest would be conducted in a manner consistent with the states public health guidance. That is not what occurred, and CHP will take this experience into account when considering permits for this or any other group, it said.
Colorado
Denver: More than 67,000 more people filed for unemployment in the state last week, bringing the total number of new applications for the past month to just over 279,000, the Department of Labor and Employment said Thursday. The number of new unemployment applications last week was less than the 104,217 new claims reported during the previous week. However, self-employed and gig workers and others not previously able to collect unemployment benefits were only allowed to start filing claims Monday and are not included in the latest official count. Like other states, Colorado had to come up with a new process for accepting those claims and verifying the amount of money to which those workers were entitled. So far, more than 30,000 people have filed claims through the new application, the department said.
Connecticut
Hartford: Experts are expressing concern about the effects the pandemic is having on those needing help for drug addiction and other behavioral health services. Dr. J. Craig Allen, the medical director at Hartford HealthCares Rushford treatment center, said isolation and anxiety can wreak havoc on those with substance abuse issues in the best of times. He said there has been a decline in those seeking help at the same time there has been a rise in sales of things such as alcohol, vaping products and cigarettes. Hartford HealthCare has set up what officials are calling a warm line for those who need to talk to a recovery specialist. Meanwhile, the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services announced Wednesday that it has been awarded a $2 million federal grant to address behavioral health care needs of different populations heavily affected by the pandemic. 
Delaware
Dover: Prison officials in the state say they have no plans to expedite the release of inmates because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Delaware State News reports Department of Correction facilities are operating at less than 75% capacity. The department said COVID-19 has largely been limited to a minimum-security housing unit at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center. Officials said there is ample space to handle more cases. DOC Commissioner Claire DeMatteis expressed concerns about where inmates would go if they were released and the fact that there is still a risk to exposure on the outside as well. The other side of releasing inmates is where do they go, she said. Were all about reentry; now were just going to release a bunch of people with no place to go, no health care, no job, no prospect for a job. Exactly how does that help us?
District of Columbia
Washington: The board that oversees the metropolitan areas Metrorail system is taking advantage of decreased ridership by greatly expanding a series of planned maintenance closures over the summer. The expanded summer shutdowns will affect northern Virginia in particular the entire Silver Line, which serves Reston and the Tysons Corner areas, will be closed. Nine stations in Fairfax and Arlington counties will close. Service on the Orange and Silver lines will terminate in Virginia at the Ballston station. Several of those stations had already been slated for closure this summer to repair rider platforms and perform other maintenance. Metro officials say ridership declines of as much as 95% due to the coronavirus provide an opportunity to do even more maintenance with less disruption. The closures begin May 23 and are expected to run through the fall. Free shuttle buses will run from some of the closed stations.
Florida
Miami: A shipment of 1 million face masks en route to South Florida for firefighters was confiscated last week by the federal government, Miami-Dades top emergency management official said. Frank Rollason, the director of emergency management for Miami-Dade County, told WLRN on Wednesday that the masks were for firefighters who planned to begin at-home new coronavirus testing for homebound Miami-Dade residents who cant make it to drive-thru testing sites. We thought we were in pretty good shape with having that amount coming in, and they were we were usurped, Rollason said. Miami-Dade has the largest number of confirmed cases in Florida, with almost 10,300 as of Thursday morning. Statewide, there are more than 28,500 confirmed cases. WLRN reports that other shipments of masks meant for municipalities also have been confiscated by the federal government.

Brian Kemps plan to allow businesses like salons to reopen this weekend.
 (Photo: Ron Harris/AP)
Atlanta: Gov. Brian Kemps plan to begin cracking open the economy faces two major hurdles the state is struggling to increase testing for new coronavirus infections and to boost tracking of those in contact with infected people. Without those capabilities, Georgia risks a quick rebound of the COVID-19 illness as Kemp allows some businesses to reopen in coming days. The Republican governors decision has been questioned because the state has yet to show continuing progress in those areas, and it could be difficult to catch up. The virus moves faster than government does, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. So if I had to bet on who would come out of the gate faster, it would be the virus. Georgia has ranked in the bottom 10 per capita in testing.
Hawaii
Hilo: Daily arrests on the Big Island have plunged 33% since the governor issued a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Hawaii County Police Department said. Hawaii Police Chief Ferreira confirmed the decrease in arrests during the period after Democratic Gov. David Iges emergency proclamation took effect March 25, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The decrease has various explanations, including an expanded use of citations by officers to deal with some crimes, Ferreira said. Were not actively going out there and pursuing (suspects on) bench warrants, Ferreira said. Another factor is the smaller number of people committing crimes in their vehicles, including driving under the influence. Because the bars are closed, and because of the stay-at-home order, you have less people on the roadway, Ferreira said.
Idaho
Idaho Gov. Brad Little speaks at a news conference at his Statehouse office in Boise.

Boise: Gov. Brad Littles efforts to flatten the curve and slow the rate of infection and spread of the coronavirus after it made a rapid entry into the state last month have succeeded. But with infections slowing, the Republican governor is facing growing unrest within his own party, and groups are chafing at his stay-at-home order and the closure of nonessential businesses despite the risk of a second wave of infections. Calls to disobey have increased along with a smattering of defiant actions across the state. I think once it looks like weve got past the worst of it, it makes it seem like, Why dont we open back up? said Jaclyn Kettler, a Boise State University political scientist. At the same time, theres a lot of risk we might not fully understand. Idaho is unique in that most states facing coordinated pushback for virus closures have Democratic governors. 
Illinois
Springfield: Republicans in the states House on Tuesday suggested ways to slowly reopen businesses and relax restrictions on public interaction as the threat from COVID-19 potentially recedes. With Gov. J.B. Pritzkers stay-at-home order scheduled to expire April 30, GOP lawmakers are seeking relief for a devastated economy and frustrated constituents. Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield said he hoped their proposed modifications would get buy-in from the public. There was no specific start date mentioned. The proposal came just a day after Pritzker raised the specter of a stay-at-home extension when he announced that the rising number of COVID-19 cases, expected to peak in the latter half of April, now wont top out until mid-May. At his daily briefing later Wednesday, Pritzker gave a lukewarm response to the GOP plans, which include reopening car dealerships, golf courses, state parks, department stores and hair salons. 
Indiana
Indianapolis: The states first coronavirus infections occurred at least a couple of weeks before the first illness for a resident was confirmed in early March, the state health commissioner said Wednesday. That would indicate the virus could have been spreading around Indiana for perhaps six weeks before the statewide stay-at-home order took effect March 25. We tracked cases that we thought probably went back to at least mid-February, said the health commissioner, Dr. Kristina Box. The earlier infections are in line with the determination of two coronavirus deaths in California in early and mid-February, showing that the virus was spreading in the U.S. well before health officials realized it. There will be individuals that never hit the hospital system that may very well have had COVID-19, and they wont know that until we have that good antibody test out there to show that they are immune, Box said.

Des Moines: The states livestock producers face tumbling prices after hundreds of meatpacking workers have tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in Midwest processing plants significantly slowing production or closing. The situation could turn tragic for pork producers, who face the possibility of euthanizing thousands of animals backed up on farms across the state. Producers face horrible choices, said Dermot Hayes, an Iowa State University agriculture economist. Pork processing capacity has shrunk by about 25%, crushing hog prices, which have tumbled about 50% since January. Iowa is the nations largest pork producer, with nearly 25 million pigs in confinements. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday hes heard estimates that the country has about 100,000 pigs that should be slaughtered each day but arent. Apply that over 10 days, and with a million pigs, youve got a big problem, the Iowa Republican said.
Kansas
Topeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has suspended multiple regulations licensing medical professionals to make it easier for them to work in health care facilities and nursing homes. The executive order Kelly issued Wednesday suspends requirements that doctors supervise physician assistants, advanced practice practical nurses and licensed practical nurses. The order also allows nurses with inactive or lapsed licenses to provide services and permits medical or nursing students to volunteer to work in health care facilities. Our health care facilities need as much flexibility as possible as we approach our projected peak infection rate in the coming days to ensure that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, Kelly said Wednesday. The governor said the order is a first step, and health care providers face broader and more complex challenges. She said she cannot address them with an executive order and called on the Legislature to consider rewriting licensing laws.

Louisville: Making it through the first Saturday in May without a Kentucky Derby will be tough for a lot of people in the Bluegrass State. Churchill Downs has a plan, though. The home of the Run for the Roses is planning to host a daylong, at-home, virtual Kentucky Derby party thatll feature a virtual race among all 13 past Triple Crown winners to raise $2 million for COVID-19 emergency relief funds. The 146th Kentucky Derby has been postponed until Sept. 5 due to public health concerns over the growing coronavirus pandemic. A special broadcast will air on NBC from 3 to 6 p.m. May 2 featuring the 2015 Kentucky Derby that kicked off American Pharoahs historic Triple Crown run. In addition, the broadcast will highlight Churchill Downs first-ever virtual horse race The Kentucky Derby: Triple Crown Showdown, a computer-simulated version of a race under the historic Twin Spires of Churchill Downs.
Louisiana
New Orleans: Masks will be recommended attire even when stay-at-home orders and restrictions on business activity are eased during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday. He noted medical experts guidance saying proper masks keep patients infected with coronavirus from spreading it to others. Think of wearing a mask in public as just being polite to others, Edwards said at his daily news conference, calling mask-wearing part of new normal of life when restrictions are lifted. It remained unclear exactly how and when restrictions will be lifted, but Edwards said he expects to deliver more information as early as Monday. Louisianas current stay-at-home emergency order, banning gatherings of more than 10 people and forcing closure of many nonessential businesses, expires April 30. The Democratic governor has been reluctant to speculate on what will be done next. 
Maine
Portland: Unemployment claims have slowed somewhat in the state but remain much higher than historical averages. A total of 11,560 people made initial claims for unemployment compensation in the week that ended April 18, the Maine Department of Labor reported. That was the lowest number of initial claims in the past five weeks. Meanwhile, new cellphone data suggests about 40% of Mainers are staying put in their homes on any given day, abiding by the governors stay-at-home order. The percentage of Mainers staying home grew steadily to about 35% after the states first coronavirus case was announced March 12, the Bangor Daily News reports. The figure rose to its current level after Mills issued a formal stay-at-home order March 31. The newspaper cited an analysis by SafeGraph. 
Maryland
Baltimore: Crime in the city is continuing to fall during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports property crime was already on a steep decline. Violent crime is falling as well, although not as much. Police reported 71 total violent crimes for the week ending April 18. Thats a stark decline from the previous week, which had seen 152 violent crimes reported. There were 196 violent crimes reported for the week ending March 21. For the past month, total violent crimes are down 26% compared with the same period last year. Total shootings and gun-related homicides are also down by a third during the past month compared to last year. Experts had expected crime to decline in the wake of the stay-at-home orders that have been imposed in an effort to curb the viruss spread and keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.

Boston: The states death toll in the coronavirus pandemic surged past 2,000 on Wednesday, about doubling in just seven days as the Boston area becomes a hot spot. Public health officials said there were 221 new deaths, pushing the overall toll to 2,182. It was the most deaths reported in a single day since the outbreak in Massachusetts began, and it marked the first time the state has recorded more than 200 in a day. Massachusetts saw its first COVID-19 death March 20, and the outbreak has intensified despite strict social distancing measures and contact tracing aimed at slowing transmission. The state passed 1,000 deaths April 15, when 1,108 were reported. There were more than 1,700 new cases reported Wednesday, bringing the number of confirmed cases close to 43,000. More than half the deaths 1,205 were reported in long-term care centers, such as nursing homes. The average age of people who have died of confirmed COVID-19 is 82, officials said. 
Michigan
Detroit: A major health care provider in southeastern Michigan said the number of COVID-19 patients had dropped below 500 this week for the first time in nearly a month. Henry Ford Health System reported 490 patients Thursday morning at five hospitals, a sign that the coronavirus was slowing down. It had 426 patients March 28 and more than 700 on April 8. COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Henry Ford said it has discharged 1,549 patients during the outbreak. Beaumont Health has also reported a significant drop in patients at its Detroit-area hospitals. Both health care providers are temporarily laying off thousands of people due to a lack of revenue from medical procedures that have been suspended.

Minneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday ordered schools to stay closed through the rest of the academic year amid the COVID-19 crisis. Walz, a former teacher, called it a heartbreaking decision. The Democratic governor said he feels sorry for all the students who will miss out on graduations, tournaments and end-of-year celebrations. But Walz said the health and safety of Minnesotans is his top priority, so distance learning will continue through the end of this school year. While I recognize distance learning is a challenge for many families, it is critical to social distancing in Minnesota and supports the health of Minnesotas families. We will continue looking for ways to improve the current system and better support our children, Walz said in a statement. He also outlined his approach for gradually loosening restrictions on businesses over time, saying his decision will allow up to 100,000 Minnesotans to return to work in industrial, manufacturing and office settings next Monday.
Mississippi
Tupelo: The switch to virtual events during the coronavirus pandemic includes a festival honoring the king of rock n roll. Organizers for the Tupelo Elvis Festival announced Wednesday that the music event slated to be held in June will now be a virtual gathering. The health and safety of our patrons is most important, but we are excited to share our festival with the world, Debbie Brangenberg, the executive director of the festival, told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. The annual fest honoring Tupelo-born Elvis Presley features performances from musicians and gospel groups and includes a competition to qualify for the Ultimate Elvis Tribute Contest held in Memphis. Organizers are offering refunds for those who do not want to attend a virtual festival.
Missouri
OFallon: Leaders of counties on the edge of the states two metropolitan areas are showing an increasing urge to end business shutdowns necessitated by the coronavirus, breaking with urban leaders who have extended stay-at-home orders for several weeks. The majority of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have occurred in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. Democratic leaders of St. Louis city and county, Kansas City and Jackson County have extended stay-at-home orders until at least mid-May in hopes of containing the spread of the disease. But amid a growing backlash to social distancing restrictions and the economic fallout, Republican leaders of counties adjacent to the urban core are opting to allow businesses to reopen sooner. Clay and Cass counties near Kansas City announced Wednesday that their stay-at-home orders will expire May 3, the same day Republican Gov. Mike Parsons emergency order expires. 
Montana
Helena: Churches can hold services Sunday, and some businesses will be able to reopen Monday as long as they practice social distancing, Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday in easing coronavirus restrictions while asking residents to continue many of the precautions they have been taking. Because Montana took the coronavirus pandemic seriously and acted quickly and because residents made sacrifices to follow directives to stay at home and use social distancing, the state had the lowest numbers of hospitalizations per capita, Bullock said. The health department reports 59 people were hospitalized and 14 people have died from COVID-19. Two deaths were reported Wednesday. Reilly Neill, a former Democratic state representative and publisher from Livingston, said she thinks Bullock is acting too quickly without enough consideration for the amount of asymptomatic spread of the virus or plans for methodical statewide testing and tracing.
Nebraska
Lincoln: A new state website designed to ramp up testing for the coronavirus logged about 20,000 new registrations on its first day, and the data that residents submit could help determine which parts of the state get tested first, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. Ricketts said the $27 million program, similar to ones Iowa and Utah, will help state officials decide where to first use the 540,000 new tests that were included in the deal with a private contractor. He said front-line medical and public safety workers will get first priority for testing, followed by people who report a lot of symptoms on the Test Nebraska website, followed by people with just a symptoms and then potentially people who are asymptomatic. Part of it, frankly, will be driven by people filling out the assessment, Ricketts said at his weekday coronavirus news conference.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman is under fire after an interview on CNN in which she offered up her city to be a placebo group during vaccine trials and said she wanted casinos and other nonessential businesses reopened during the coronavirus pandemic.

Las Vegas: State officials condemned comments Wednesday by Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman after she called for casinos and other nonessential businesses to reopen and suggested the city could serve as a test case to measure the impact during the coronavirus pandemic. One local official called her comments reckless and dangerous, and another described them as an embarrassment. Goodman, during a 25-minute interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, said she wants everything back open, including casinos, restaurants and small businesses, and a return of conventions. The politically independent mayor suggested that viruses for years have been here and said she had suggested that the residents of Las Vegas become a control group, serving as that placebo side, to see how relaxing closures and restrictions would affect the city.
New Hampshire
Stratham: Some summer fairs in the state have already been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Stratham Fair, annually the first in a season of fairs that stretches into October, on Wednesday called off the event, scheduled for July 16-19. The annual Lancaster Fair, held during Labor Day weekend, also was canceled. At this time of year, the Fair Board would typically be fundraising, hiring entertainment, entering into contracts, and making decisions about our fair programs, the directors said in a statement Wednesday. During this public health pandemic, when our entire community is under such an intense strain, it is not feasible to request or make such commitments.
New Jersey
Trenton: Gov. Phil Murphy says the two drive-thru testing sites operated with the federal government cannot yet begin taking asymptomatic residents. Murphy corrected an earlier statement from the Monmouth County Prosecutors office that said the testing for residents without symptoms would begin. Murphy said the state first needs to obtain a waiver from the federal government. The state operates the drive-thru facilities with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. One is at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, Monmouth County. The other is at Bergen Community College in Paramus. Beyond the two federally affiliated facilities, New Jersey has nearly 90 sites other testing centers across the state and conducts about 9,000 tests a day, according to Murphy, who said he thinks the state needs to double the number of tests it does daily.
New Mexico
Santa Fe: Mental health and substance abuse programs in the state will be getting an infusion of funding as part of the U.S. governments relief efforts related to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Members of the states congressional delegation say a $2 million grant has been awarded to the state Human Services Department to fund behavioral health services during the pandemic. Officials expect the demand for such services to increase because of the public health toll of the outbreak. We cant allow this pandemic to create any lapses in behavior health care for New Mexicans who need it, Sen. Martin Heinrich said in a statement. Our state has long faced challenges providing adequate behavioral health resources. That has only been exacerbated during this crisis. To boost access, the state has launched NMConnect, a new app that provides free 24-hour crisis and non-crisis support.

New York: More evidence is emerging that far more New Yorkers have had the coronavirus than the number confirmed by lab tests, officials said Thursday. A state survey of about 3,000 people found that 13.9% had antibodies suggesting they had been exposed to the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news briefing in Albany. In New York City, 21% of the people tested had antibodies. Cuomo cautioned that the data was preliminary. The sample of people tested was small, and people were recruited for the study at shopping centers and grocery stores, which meant they were healthy enough to be out in public. Experts also say having antibodies is not necessarily proof someone is immune to the virus. But Cuomo said knowing how many people have antibodies could potentially help set policy on when to reopen parts of the state. Earlier Thursday, New York Citys health commissioner said many as 1 million people in the city may have been exposed.
North Carolina
Charlotte: A number of beer and wine distributors in the state are volunteering their tractor-trailers to help stock grocery stores and food pantries in the midst of the coronavirus. The NC Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers and NC Retail Merchants associations have joined forces to provide its trucks and commercial drivers to get products to the stores, The Charlotte Observer reports, noting the groups are acting with the approval of the state ABC Commission. Since Gov. Roy Coopers stay-at-home order went into effect March 17, distributors lost about a quarter of their business that normally delivers to restaurants and bars, said Tim Kent, executive director of NC Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers Association. Ive got drivers willing to help anyone having distribution difficulties, Kent said. These are extraordinary times that require extraordinary measures.
North Dakota
Bismarck: Health officials said the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state now exceeds 700. The North Dakota Department of Health on Thursday also reported one new death, a woman in her 80s from Cass County with underlying medical conditions, bringing the states total to 15. Health officials said 32 additional people tested positive for COVID-19 since Wednesday, bringing the state total to 709. Health officials said two previous cases reported earlier were people who lived out of state and were removed from the states tally. There were 18 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized Thursday. Officials said 741 people have been screened since Wednesday, bringing the total tested in North Dakota to 16,330. They said 15,621 of those tests have come back negative.
Ohio
Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday announced an easing up on the prohibition of elective surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic. DeWine said that doctors can now review postponed procedures and surgeries with patients in terms of their current health situation and quality of life, after which doctors and patients can make a joint decision about whether to proceed. DeWine said patients must be informed of the risk of contracting COVID-19 and must also be told of the impact of contracting the illness during the post-operative recovery process. Ive heard stories that some surgeries that we had no intention of stopping have been postponed, DeWine said. That has concerned me a great deal, so we are starting back one step at a time. The governor gave the example of someone who might have postponed hip replacement surgery but now is experiencing severe pain.

Oklahoma City: Nine additional deaths in the state have been attributed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, while the number of hospitalizations in the state declined by 15, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Thursday. At least 179 people have now died of COVID-19 in Oklahoma, with eight of the additional deaths in the 65 or older age group and one who was 50-64, the department said. The number hospitalized is 284, down from 298 reported Wednesday. At least 3,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the state. Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday announced plans to begin reopening businesses in the state, starting Friday when barbershops, hair and nail salons, pet groomers and spas can reopen in cities that do not have additional restrictions. The personal care businesses must continue social distancing, and employees and customers must wear masks if they are within 6 feet of each other.
Oregon
Salem: Gov. Kate Brown announced Thursday that she will lift her order delaying non-urgent medical procedures, if health care providers can demonstrate they have met new requirements for COVID-19 safety and preparedness. Hospitals, surgical centers, medical offices and dental offices that meet those requirements will be able to resume non-urgent procedures May 1, Brown said in a statement. As anyone waiting for an elective surgery knows, non-urgent does not mean minor, Brown said. This is incredibly important medical care that we would not have told providers to delay if the threat of COVID-19 had not made it necessary. The Oregon Health Authority on Wednesday reported 57 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state total to nearly 2,060. The agency for the first time in several weeks reported no new deaths in its daily report. At least 78 people have died from the coronavirus in the state. 
Pennsylvania
Harrisburg: The Pennsylvania Department of Health slashed the states COVID-19 death toll by 201 on Thursday, saying probable deaths it had previously included in the count were eliminated after further investigation. The overall death toll now stands at 1,421, down from 1,622 reported a day earlier. The number of deaths confirmed by a positive virus test actually rose overnight by 69, to 1,394. But Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Thursday that 270 probable deaths that had been added to the death toll in recent days have been removed after further investigation. State health officials had recently changed the way they count COVID-19 deaths now including probable deaths along with confirmed deaths which resulted in a doubling of the states death toll in just four days. A probable death is one in which a coroner or medical examiner listed COVID-19 as the cause or contributing cause, but the deceased was not tested for the virus.
Rhode Island
Providence: The state has launched a new website that allows residents to check whether they are at risk of getting or may have contracted the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. The site, covidselfcheck.ri.gov, launched by the state Department of Health in conjunction with Diagnostic Robotics, asks residents about their symptoms, their possible exposure and other risk factors in English, Spanish or Portuguese and recommends whether they should see a health care professional. Its not a substitute for consulting a doctor but a guide to help you figure out if you should do that, the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. The site also uses predictive technology to recognize possible outbreaks before they occur.

Columbia: More than 341,000 people in the state have said they lost their jobs since the coronavirus pandemic began. The 73,000 jobless claims filed for the week ending April 18 marked the first drop since businesses began closing for COVID-19 in March, according to figures released Thursday from the state Department of Employment and Workforce. But all the people reporting they are out of work over the past five weeks represent more than 14% of the workforce in February in South Carolina. Amid that alarming backdrop, Gov. Henry McMaster called his first meeting Thursday of a group he calls Accelerate South Carolina. More than two dozen mayors, presidents of institutions of higher learning, business owners, health care professionals and lawmakers are tasked with figuring out how to reopen the state after closing for the coronavirus pandemic.
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended that the operators of a meatpacking plant where nearly 800 workers contracted the coronavirus implement a strict social distancing policy and find ways to overcome language barriers. Smithfield Foods closed its Sioux Falls plant indefinitely because of the outbreak and faced complaints that it wasnt doing enough to protect its workers. A CDC team toured the plant last week and reported the company had slowed down production lines to space workers farther apart and installed about 800 Plexiglas barriers along the lines. But even though there were only a few workers left in the plant, some were still gathering closer than 6 feet apart when not at their work stations or not wearing face masks, the team found. Plant management told the CDC that more than 40 languages were spoken at the plant, making it difficult to communicate guidance to employees. 
Tennessee
Nashville: State officials on Wednesday finally released more detailed information surrounding confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in its long-term care facilities after open-government advocates, Democratic lawmakers and others urged for its release. The states Department of Health had previously held off disclosing such information, saying the state needed to protect patient privacy. Similar to previous attempts by the state to withhold certain information during its fight against the coronavirus, officials eventually reversed course by conceding that the information was valuable to the public. According to the state, 37 deaths have occurred in the states long-term care facilities, and at least 375 cases have been confirmed. Yet discrepancies in the newly released data remain between what the state and local governments are reporting.
Texas
Beaumont: Mayor Becky Ames says she did not violate the citys stay-at-home order when she visited a closed nail shop. After a picture that circulated on social media sparked criticism of the mayor showing her nails soaking in a bowl, Ames explained she wasnt getting a manicure but was soaking her fingertips in acetone to remove the artificial nails. Ames said the salon owner told her that the shop wasnt open but that she would mix up some solution for pickup, according to Beaumont Enterprise. The photograph was taken while Ames was soaking her nails to learn how to take them off. Ames said she didnt know who took the photo or even realize there was a third person in the salon. The owner said it was an employee who had stopped by to pick up nail polish to use at home. The worker has been informed she cannot return to the shop, though it was not immediately known for how long.

Salt Lake City: The state launched a new cellphone app Wednesday to track coronavirus symptoms and identify people who may have been exposed, known as contact tracing. The state has a contract worth up to $2.75 million with the social media company Twenty, which makes an app that helps people use location data to find their friends to hang out. The company used its technology to build an app called Healthy Together for the state. People who download the app will get daily reminders to self-report any symptoms, then be directed to testing if theyre at risk. If a case is confirmed, the app will use cellphone location data to trace back everyone they may have exposed to the virus, even those people who they dont know or with whom they never spoke. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said data privacy is of upmost concern. People would have to opt-in, and location data will be deleted after 30 days, except in cases where there are legal requirements to keep it longer. 
Vermont
Montpelier: The Vermont House of Representatives held its first full, online floor session Thursday, a legislative response to the COVID-19 epidemics need to stay apart while finding a way to pass legislation. From homes across the state, 153 members of the House and a handful of staff, some of whom were in the Statehouse, met electronically. A few lawmakers called in and werent visible online. The session came after lawmakers held 14 committee practice sessions and many smaller online meetings since the House gave preliminary approval last month to a resolution authorizing the online sessions. The first order of business was to formally adopt the the online voting system, which under the rule governing the meetings required approval by three-quarters of the lawmakers online. This remote system for representing our constituents and meeting our constitutional responsibilities is clearly flawed, Rep. Anne Donahue, a Northfield Republican. I cannot pretend that I feel able to function in the way I would normally consider to be necessary to meet those duties.
Virginia
Culpeper: Two Republican state senators are representing a gym owner who is suing the governor over his executive order that closed down nonessential businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. State Sen. Bill Stanley and Ryan McDougle filed the lawsuit in Culpeper County on Tuesday on behalf of Merrill C. Sandy Hall, who owns several Golds Gym franchises. The lawsuit argues Gov. Ralph Northam exceeded his authority when ordering the closure of nonessential businesses, including fitness centers, on March 23. It also seeks relief from the executive order so Hall can open up his businesses. While announcing the lawsuit, Stanley said the doors of the gyms should no longer be shuttered and need to be reopened, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. McDougle, who chairs the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, accused Northam of failing to isolate people infected with the virus so that Virginians could be protected against government overreach.
Washington
Seattle: In a historic setting, the state Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday while sitting alone in their separate chambers using Zoom technology in a case that seeks the release of inmates in the states prisons due to the coronavirus outbreak. They dont have the ability to keep themselves safe, said Nicholas Straley, a lawyer representing the inmates. Theyre reliant on the state to provide them the opportunity to be safe. We can all hold out in our homes. We can decide who we allow into our homes. People in prison do not have that option. Assistant Attorney General John Samson said the corrections department has handed out face masks, created separated sleeping space, tested 300 inmates for COVID-19 and released some offenders, but releasing thousands more could pose a threat not only to the public but also to the inmates, who could end up homeless. The court concluded the hearing without saying when it would rule on the case.

A customer leaves with a carry-out order at the newly opened Cook Out restaurant Thursday in Cross Lanes, W.Va.

Cross Lanes: The cars snaked out of the parking lot, up the road and onto the interstate as a newly opened restaurant during the coronavirus pandemic caused quite a stir among cooped-up residents in this small town. Cook Outs soft opening Wednesday was a smashing success. Thursdays first full day had customers jammed three cars across to get to the drive-thru window in Cross Lanes, a community of about 10,000 that, until now, had not seen traffic like this in weeks. Residents from nearby towns who had been stuck indoors for more than a month got their reason to get outside, even in Thursdays heavy rains. Gov. Jim Justice has ordered residents to stay home unless they have a pressing need to go somewhere. And when they do, people arent supposed to gather in crowds of five or more. Wednesdays soft opening on a sunny spring day prompted a dozen people at times to stand outside the walk-up window.
Wisconsin
Madison: Organizers of a rally against the states stay-at-home order said Wednesday that theyll proceed with the event even though their permit to hold it on the grounds of the Capitol was denied. Two local sheriffs, meanwhile, cast doubt on whether they would enforce the states recently extended order that was designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The protest planned for Friday would be the latest in a string of events across the country against such orders that demonstrators say are damaging the economy. It has the potential to be the largest yet in Wisconsin; as of Wednesday, more than 3,300 people said on Facebook that they are going, and 12,000 were interested. The extension of the statewide stay-at-home order until May 26 has prompted the sheriffs in Racine and Polk counties to say theyre not planning heavy enforcement. 
Wyoming
Cheyenne: The Trump administration on Thursday urged government intervention to rescue U.S. uranium mining and nuclear fuel industries in a tough global marketplace, from making it easier to mine public lands out West to blocking some imports of foreign nuclear fuel. Republican Sen. John Barrasso of the mining state of Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Thursday that Russia had weaponized its nuclear fuel to undercut uranium miners in the U.S. The coronavirus pandemic has clearly demonstrated why America should not rely on other nations to supply critical materials. That includes uranium, Barrasso said in a statement.

Birmingham: The states Alcoholic Beverage Control Board reported a 10% increase in sales last month, and medical professionals say the spike in demand may signal struggles with mental health. The ABC Board made over $6 million more in sales in March 2020, compared to last March, WBMA-TV reports. The sales boost is being attributed to the new coronavirus, which has led to social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. When you cant go out with your buddies, or you cant have your friends in for a nice meal and an alcoholic beverage, then you tend to want to keep something out of that scenario normal, and that is the sale of alcohol, said Dean Argo of the ABC Board. But measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus could exacerbate mental health conditions that lead to some people consuming more alcohol, the television station reports.
Alaska
Anchorage: Protesters have demanded that the mayor shut down a homeless camp they say is contributing to crime and threatening public health during the coronavirus pandemic. A group of 25 demonstrators gathered Friday across from the camp included people who live, work or own businesses nearby, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The group called for Municipality of Anchorage Democratic Mayor Ethan Berkowitz to close the camp as part of the enforcement of a statewide order to remain in place to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. People camping outside are a difficult population to deal with, but police are stepping up patrols, and Berkowitz said he is listening to the recommendations of frustrated residents. We are doing what we can to reduce the number of people who are engaged in conduct that is criminal, and if there is a crime, that has been reported to (Anchorage Police Department), he said.
Arizona
Phoenix: With the state considering reopening its economy May 1, health experts said Arizona isnt yet doing enough COVID-19 testing or collecting good enough data to responsibly lift stay-at-home orders. Arizona had done 51,000 tests through Saturday, a fraction of the COVID-19 tests needed to judge how widespread the outbreak is in a state this size. Measured in tests per million residents, the state was in the bottom 10 nationwide last week. And data the state provides is widely seen as inadequate. The state is missing demographic data about positive cases and deaths, its location data mixes hospitals with private residences, and the state wont provide data about cases and deaths on Indian reservations or in nursing homes. It just isnt going to work unless you have crystal clear data, said William Haseltine, an infectious disease expert and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International. 
Arkansas
Little Rock: The first death of a health care worker in the state is among two additional deaths in Arkansas due to COVID-19, state officials said Sunday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson also said nearly 2,000 inmates will be considered for early release in response to questions about possible compassionate release of people in state prisons. The death of a worker at Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff is one of two that bring to 40 the number who have died in the state due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith. The number of coronavirus cases rose by 42 to at least 1,781. Hutchinson said 348 inmates at the states maximum-security unit have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 118 from Saturday. The governor said hes asked the state parole board to review 1,990 nonviolent, non-sex-offender inmates statewide who are due for release within six months for possible early release.
California
Los Angeles: The state reported its first prison inmate death from COVID-19 on Sunday as it steps up efforts to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable populations, including people living in nursing homes, on the streets or in homeless shelters. The inmate died at a hospital after contracting the coronavirus at the California Institution for Men in San Bernardino County, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. Statewide, 115 inmates and 89 corrections employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, corrections officials said. In recent days, California released for the first time details about nursing homes facing outbreaks as the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to rise. The information released by the Department of Public Health showed nearly 260 skilled nursing facilities with more than 3,000 total positive cases among patients and staff.

Denver: Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest outside the Capitol on Sunday against the states stay-at-home order and its closure of thousands of nonessential businesses as ways to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Horn-honking motorists lined up for several blocks on an avenue leading to the Capitol building, then circled it as pedestrians, some not wearing masks, congregated closely outside the building. Many waved American flags and held signs that read End the Virus, Not the Economy and We need stability to stay healthy, The Denver Post reports. Other signs expressed support for President Donald Trump, who has called for a rapid economic reopening, and against Gov. Jared Polis, whose orders shuttered thousands of nonessential businesses. Police officers wearing masks and gloves kept tabs on the protest.
Connecticut
Hartford: Two consecutive days of reductions in the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state are a promising sign in its fight against the outbreak, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. But Lamont, a Democrat, said people will need to keep up social distancing and noted infections are still accelerating in the greater Hartford area. We are starting to flatten the curve, Lamont said in an interview with WNPR. Statewide, more than 17,000 residents have tested positive for the virus, and 1,127 have died. The highest numbers have been reported in Fairfield County, on the New York state line. Lamont said widespread testing for the virus will be a key to easing some of the social distancing. He said he would like to set up more rapid testing centers like one in New Haven that he visited over the weekend. Theres some nice smiles when the vast majority found out that they were not infected, he said. But overall I think about 15% did find they were infected, and that is troubling.

Harbeson: Coronavirus cases have hit every corner of the state, including southern Delawares chicken processing plants, which employ more than 6,000 people and offer contract work for hundreds of local farmers. While industry officials last month touted safety measures, those who work there offered a different picture of what theyre seeing behind closed doors, citing a lack of social distancing. Were not giving people chicken, one employee said, on condition of anonymity. Were infecting more people. Nelson Hill, vice president and assistant to the president at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 27, said that theres a big fear with regard to those non-union plants. ... Youre at-will. You can be terminated for any lawful reason that the company sees fit. So theres a natural fear that folks will lose their position if they were to speak out.
District of Columbia
Washington: The number of bad air quality days has plunged in the metro D.C. area since the start of March, WUSA-TV reports, citing data from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. The drop in bad air quality days likely comes in response to shelter-at-home orders linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Through April 18, COG data shows there has been only one yellow, or moderate, air quality day in metro D.C. The sole moderate air quality day since March 1 came March 19. In the same period in 2019, the district recorded 10 moderate air quality days in March and seven moderate air quality days April 1 through April 18. Car and truck pollutants, such as particulate matter and ozone, are major contributors to poor air quality, which raises the risk of respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. 
Florida
Dania Beach: As people across America make coronavirus masks with everything from T-shirts and pillowcases to vacuum cleaner bags, one Sunshine State resident is using python skin. Brian Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach, is crafting decorative mask coverings from the skin of the Burmese python, the infamous invasive species wreaking havoc on the native wildlife of the Everglades. People are going to have to cover their faces, and unfortunately the situation may last longer than we imagined, said Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach. Some people want to make a fashion statement even during this pandemic, so I want to give them options. The python skin itself doesnt provide protection, but his mask design allows for a filter or a lining to be inserted and removed. The python masks will be made with holes framed by black, silver or gold metal rings, which will add a hint of luxury to the items, he said.

Atlanta: The governor announced plans Monday to restart the states economy before the end of the week, saying many businesses that closed to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus could reopen as early as Friday. Georgias timetable, one of the most aggressive in the nation, would allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors to reopen as long as owners follow strict social distancing and hygiene requirements. Elective medical procedures would also resume. Bars, live performance venues and amusement parks will remain closed. But by Monday, movie theaters may resume selling tickets, and restaurants limited to takeout orders could return to limited dine-in service. Such a swift reopening runs counter to the advice of many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the governments top authority on infectious diseases, who warned again Monday that resuming business too soon risked a fresh spike in infections.
Hawaii
Honolulu: Transient vacation rental units are proving difficult for officials to regulate during the coronavirus pandemic as they serve as shelter for many of the states visitors. Many of the 2,970 visitors who arrived in Hawaii during the 23 days prior to Sunday are believed to have stayed in transient vacation rentals, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Transient rentals are defined as a room, apartment, house, condominium, beach house, hotel room, suite, or similar living accommodation rented for less than 180 consecutive days, according to the state Department of Taxation. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued 14-day mandatory self-quarantine orders for passengers arriving on trans-Pacific and interisland flights to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau plan to add extra verification steps to confirm information from arriving passengers, authority President and CEO Chris Tatum said.
Idaho
Boise: St. Lukes Health System says its significantly increasing its testing capacity for the coronavirus by using its own labs starting Monday. Hospital officials said they hope facilities in Boise, Twin Falls, Ketchum, Meridian, Nampa and McCall can start using their own labs that could boost testing capacity past 1,700 per day by May. But that depends on getting particular testing supplies that have been in high demand. St. Lukes also said drive-up screening tents for the coronavirus would be operating from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days a week in Boise, Meridian and Twin Falls starting Monday. The screening tents had been operating to 6 p.m., but officials said volume is greater in the morning. Idaho has at least 1,668 virus cases and 44 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally Monday.
Illinois
Rockford: Five northern Illinois mayors have asked Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the authority to reopen businesses next month, urging local control over restrictions and common sense modifications to a statewide stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker has said hes continually evaluating an extension of the order, which expires April 30. The Winnebago County leaders of communities ranging in population from roughly 1,300 to 23,000 people said in a letter to Pritzker that thousands of employees, including in the restaurant, fitness and salon industries, are being unnecessarily harmed because theyre not considered essential workers, according to the Rockford Register Star. The leaders are from Loves Park, Machesney Park, South Beloit, Cherry Valley and Durand. However, the mayor of Rockford, the countys largest city, disagreed with the effort, saying its not the time to reverse course.

West Lafayette: Purdue University students who operate a small community farm are raising crops for local food banks to help feed students and local residents alike during the coronavirus pandemic. The Purdue Student Farm usually sells its produce to Purdue food services, which serves those vegetables at the universitys dining service. But the student farm found itself without customers after on-campus classes were canceled and most students returned home amid the pandemic. We didnt want to stop producing the food because we know there would be a need in the community, said Steve Hallett, a horticulture and landscape architecture professor and adviser to the student farm. Chris Adair, who manages the students who work at the farm, said theyre currently harvesting spinach and bagging it for donation to the Food Finders Food Bank, which serves residents in the area, and Purdues own food bank.
Iowa
Iowa City: A beef processing plant that was idled after the coronavirus outbreak resumed production Monday, one day after the state said 177 workers there have tested positive. The Iowa Premium plant in Tama, owned by National Beef, had suspended production after the company confirmed multiple workers had the virus. On Sunday, the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds said 177 out of more than 500 National Beef workers tested were positive for coronavirus. A woman who answered the phone at the plant confirmed that production resumed Monday. The company closed the plant for what it called a regularly scheduled cleaning two weeks ago. The governors office also said Sunday that another 84 employees of Tyson Foods had tested positive. Tyson said its Waterloo pork plant remained open Monday, defying calls from local officials to suspend production. Its Columbus Junction plant remained closed, and its Perry plant was idled for a one-day cleaning.
Kansas
Mission: The state has received more personal protective equipment and supplies to expand COVID-19 testing in communities with meat processing plants. Gov. Laura Kelly announced Monday that the federal supplies will go to Finney, Ford and Seward counties in southwest Kansas and Lyon County in the east-central part of the state. As of Sunday, 247 people in those counties were infected with the coronavirus out of 1,849 statewide. Cargill, Tyson Fresh Meats and National Beef have said employees at their processing plants tested positive. Kansas Department of Health and Environment is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track clusters connected to the processing plants. Controlling the outbreaks is crucial: Plants in southwest Kansas account for 25% to 30% of beef processing in the country.
Kentucky
Louisville: The states public schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year, capping off an unprecedented academic year. Students should continue their education at home through distance learning plans, Gov. Andy Beshear told superintendents Monday afternoon. Its been recommended Kentucky schools do not return to in-person classes for the rest of 2019-20 year, the Kentucky Department of Education tweeted. State education officials will work with school districts to finish distance learning by the end of May, although many districts may finish earlier. The elongated closure means teachers will not get to say goodbye to their students in person. Graduating seniors likely wont get to experience end-of-year celebrations before heading off to the next stop. But weeks of distance learning are taking a toll on educators and parents, many of whom are being asked to act in multiple roles as kitchens and living rooms become makeshift classrooms.
Louisiana
New Orleans: A 69-year-old prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary is the first state prisoner known to have died after being diagnosed with COVID-19, state corrections officials announced Monday. Corrections officials did not identify the prisoner, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. They said he had an underlying health condition and had been hospitalized since April 15 before dying Saturday. Last week, the corrections department said an employee at the prison died with the disease. The coronavirus death toll in Louisiana was 1,328 as of midday Monday. Louisiana has started the process for temporarily furloughing up to 1,200 inmates, in a bid to decrease the viruss potential spread in the close confines of prison facilities. The ACLU of Louisiana has called the process a start but far less than what is needed to reduce the prison population and protect public health.

Portland: About 200 people rallied in the capital Monday demanding the state open back up, despite officials insistence on a cautious approach in order to prevent another coronavirus outbreak. Similar rallies have elsewhere in the country, with participants including gun-rights activists, opponents of stay-at-home orders and supporters of Republican President Donald Trump. Maines event was organized by Republican state Rep. Chris Johansen, of Aroostook County, who urged participants to maintain social distance, wear masks and abstain from openly carrying guns. He also used social media to call on demonstrators to fill up your gas tanks and get ready to rumble in Augusta. Many directed their ire at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who placed the state under a stay-at-home order starting March 31. Mills defended the order while acknowledging closures have been hard on people and businesses.
Maryland
Baltimore: Doctors in the state say theyre worried that fewer people with symptoms of a stroke or heart attack are showing up at emergency rooms. The Baltimore Sun reports doctors believe some people have chosen to avoid the emergency room because of the coronavirus pandemic. Such behavior could put possible heart attack and stroke victims at even greater risk. Doctors say some people may be concerned theyll contract the virus by visiting the hospital. Or there may be confusion over stay-at-home orders. Providers in Maryland say avoiding the hospital increases the chance of serious health complications for stroke and heart attack victims. Recoveries are often tied to how fast people are treated. Dr. Mark Vesely, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, said people will fare better if doctors can get to them more quickly.
Massachusetts
Boston: Two more field hospitals set up to deal with a surge of COVID-19 patients opened in the state Monday. The hospitals at Joint Base Cape Cod in Bourne and at the University of Massachusetts Lowells Recreation Center can each handle about 100 patients who are not in critical condition but are not well enough to be sent home. Cape Cod Healthcare is managing and staffing the Cape Cod hospital, while Lowell General Hospital is managing the UMass site. Field hospitals have also opened at the DCU Center in Worcester and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. A fifth is expected to open at UMass Dartmouth in about a week. Massachusetts is in the middle of a surge of patients, Gov. Charlie Baker has said. The state now has more than 38,000 cases and has reported more than 1,700 deaths, including 146 on Sunday, according to the state Public Health Department.
Michigan
Lansing: The governor said Sunday that she was eager to loosen businesses restrictions while also avoiding new flare-ups of the coronavirus illness that has killed nearly 2,400 people in the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said a lack of virus testing supplies is delaying such steps but maintained that most residents support her actions despite a protest drawing thousands of people to the Michigan Capitol last week. Not going to the gas station to fill up your boat, so that you can go tooling around, is a sacrifice, but it is one that is worth it, because who among us wouldnt rather forgo jet-skiing or boating right now if its going to save your grandparents or your neighbors life? Whitmer said on CNNs State of the Union. Whitmer has faced pressure from protesters who dont like her orders to keep people at home and businesses closed because of the outbreak.

St. Cloud: The coronavirus pandemic has limited the mobility of independent older adults in Central Minnesota, so theyre showing up online for yoga classes and lectures and tapping into meal programs at much higher rates than before the COVID-19 outbreak. Older adults are really resilient, said Laura Hood, aging services director for the city of St. Cloud. Theyve been through wars. Theyve supported communities. Theyve built communities. And the community programs that serve seniors adjusted quickly to do so after Gov. Tim Walzs stay-at-home order and other precautions meant to limit spread of the virus. Staff at the Whitney Senior Center have been able to connect with 70% of members electronically, Hood said. And those who are not available online get phone calls. Every week, the center emails a newsletter with resources, including links to live, interactive exercise classes and lectures. Staff provide some technical support and schedule programs that allow for group engagement, include exercise and covering other topics such as container gardens and mindfulness.
Mississippi
Jackson: The chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians says he has tested positive for COVID-19, and he is urging people to follow the advice of health professionals to try to slow the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus. Chief Cyrus Ben said in a video posted to the tribes Facebook page Saturday that he had not experienced any symptoms. He said he is quarantined with his family and continuing to work remotely. It only takes one person who has been exposed to the virus to go out in public and expose everyone that they could come in contact with, Ben said. That includes their families, their friends. And that is why we say take precaution, be vigilant. The Choctaws have 11,000 members in 10 of Mississippis 82 counties. The tribes Pearl River Resort in central Mississippis Neshoba County has two casinos and hotels. The resort is closed indefinitely because of the pandemic.

Kansas City: A growing national movement against stay-at-home orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus arrived in the Show-Me State this week. Protests were planned Monday in Kansas City and Tuesday in Jefferson City. A flyer advertising the Kansas City protest encouraged people to flood the streets of downtown Kansas City and demand that businesses be allowed to open up, people allowed to work, and lives returned to normal. The protesters contend the stay-at-home orders are unnecessary and are seriously damaging the economy. Government and health officials argue orders asking people to stay home except for essential business and to maintain social distancing are necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City Mayor Quenton Lucas announced last week that he was extending the citys stay-at-home order until May 15. Gov. Mike Parson said the state plans to take steps to begin reopening its economy May 4. 
Montana
Helena: For the first time since the state lab started running tests for coronavirus, the health department reported no positive COVID-19 tests among the 153 tests that were performed Sunday. Toole County, in north-central Montana, reported its fifth COVID-19 death Monday, raising the states total to 11. The latest victim was a woman in her 80s who was not identified. All 29 of the cases in Toole County, population about 4,800 residents, have been traced to close contact rather than community transmission, said Blair Tomsheck, director of the Toole County Health Department. Nearly all are tied to an assisted living facility and to the hospital in the city of Shelby, officials have said. Montana has reported 433 cases of COVID-19, with just over 11,000 tests performed. Nineteen people were still hospitalized out of 57 who required hospital treatment.
Nebraska
Omaha: The states primary election next month could see strong turnout if most people who requested ballots by mail return them in time. Secretary of State Bob Evnen told the Omaha World-Herald that 340,000 Nebraskans had requested mail-in ballots as of Friday. Another 50,000 voters who live in rural counties where voting by mail is the only option will also receive mail-in ballots. That total of 390,000 ballots is approaching Nebraskas highest-turnout primary in 1972, when 413,015 people voted. Nebraska voters can request mail-in ballots from their county election officials until May 1. Those ballots must be returned before 8 p.m. May 12, which is election day. Officials said more than 72,000 Nebraskans have already voted. State officials still plan to open the polls May 12 for anyone who wants to vote in person. Election workers will be provided protective gear, including masks and gloves.

Las Vegas: The agency promoting tourism in the city is quickly redoing its budget, with coronavirus casino closures and business shutdowns projected to result in a two-thirds cut in hotel room tax funding for the fiscal year starting July 1. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority chief executive Steve Hill said authority room tax revenue is expected to drop from $300 million to between $100 million and $120 million for the upcoming fiscal year, the Las Vegas Sun reports. At Hills request, the tourism agency board last week agreed to delay until next month consideration of a new budget. Fiscal year 2021 was set to be an exceptionally strong year, Hill said. We were set to set records in a number of different ways. Now, he said, fiscal year 2021 is going to be a difficult year. He said the authority was likely to lose another $60 million in income due to postponements and cancellations of conventions, meetings and trade shows at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other locations.
New Hampshire
Concord: A judge is considering whether Republican Gov. Chris Sununu can spend the states $1.25 billion in coronavirus relief aid without legislative approval. The Democratic leaders of the New Hampshire House and Senate and its joint fiscal committee sued the governor last week to halt the new Governors Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge David Anderson held a hearing on their request Monday, saying he will issue a ruling as quickly as possible. Representing the governors office, Solicitor General Dan Will pointed to a 2002 law granting the governor authority to take immediate action during a statewide crisis. Democrats argue that the governors general powers under the law Sununu cites do not override a more specific law that says during an emergency, the governor may, with the advice and consent of the fiscal committee, authorize such expenditures, by any department or agency, as may be necessary.

Trenton: The states COVID-19 outbreak is stabilizing, with the number of patients leaving hospitals outpacing those being admitted, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Despite the stabilization, 177 more people died since Sundays update, bringing the death toll to 4,377, Murphy said. There are nearly 89,000 people with the coronavirus, he said. Theres growing evidence that social distancing is helping contain the virus, according to the governor. It now takes three weeks for the number of cases to double in northern New Jersey, up from just three days over the past few weeks. For the first time, the number of people discharged from the hospital 583 outpaced newly admitted COVID-19 patients, which stood at about 460. Benchmarks to reopen the states economy will be coming in a number of days, the governor said. Murphy is allying with neighboring states to coordinate restarting the economy. More testing will be needed, among other things, he said.
New Mexico
Gallup: A high school is reopening its gym as a 60-bed alternative care facility to help hospitals treat an increasing number of coronavirus patients, a federal engineering agency said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was expected to turn over the keys to Miyamura High School to local and state health officials Monday, about two weeks after construction began, the Gallup Independent reports. Vinyl flooring and rubber pads were fixed to the gym floor, swamp coolers were placed on the roof to provide cool air, and two large exhaust ducts were installed to provide proper ventilation, said Lt. Col. Robin Scott, deputy commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Albuquerque District. The gym now features 60 patient pods separated by medical curtains, which each include one electrical outlet, an ethernet jack, lighting and oxygen, Project Manager Amanda Velasquez said. Laundry sinks are positioned throughout the gym as hand-washing stations.
New York
New York: The city wont allow public events in June, including three of the citys major annual celebrations: the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, the Celebrate Israel parade and the Pride parade on its 50th anniversary. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that the events would be canceled or at least postponed, saying it was a painful but necessary step as the city continues to fight the coronavirus. They will be back, and we will find the right way to do it, he said, allowing that its not yet clear whether it will be realistic to reschedule the events this year. The Pride parade began in 1970 as a way to commemorate the Stonewall rebellion the year before, when a police raid at the Stonewall Inn bar sparked a resistance by gay men, bisexuals, lesbians and transgender people and led to the development of more extensive and militant LGBTQ activist groups than the U.S. had seen before. The Puerto Rico and Israel parades are also touchstones in a city that has the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the biggest Puerto Rican community off the island.

Indian Trail: A miniature donkey named Mambo is getting some online love in the state, where a farm is getting in on the idea of having animals spice up tedious virtual meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. Peace N Peas Farm will rent Mambo, the 8-year-old miniature donkey, and his friends to crash company conference calls, The Charlotte Observer reports. This camera-crowding donkey is like a pesky little brother that doesnt let anyone relax too long, said Francie Dunlap, Mambos owner. Companies can choose other farm animals they want to invite as guests on their video calls. According to the farm animals meeting registration website, they include three horses, Heiren, Zeus and Eddie, along with some chickens and ducks. I think it would get some laughs, Dunlap said. Customers can reserve 10 minutes with the animals for $50, and Dunlap said co-workers can also choose a virtual meeting name for the farm animal. Since she created the website Saturday, Dunlap said she has also gotten requests from teachers who want the animals to crash their virtual classrooms.
North Dakota
Bismarck: The states largest manufacturer, Doosan Bobcat, resumed operations Monday after a two-week shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, putting some 2,300 people back to work. Doosan Bobcat restarted operations at plants in Gwinner, Bismarck and Wahpeton after making several changes aimed at protecting workers. The company said it is not aware of any workers who have tested positive for the virus. The equipment manufacturer says it increased cleaning and disinfecting at its facilities, implemented social distancing, and limited visitors while encouraging people to work remotely when possible. The No. 1 goal is the safety of our employees, company spokeswoman Stacey Breuer said. The companys restart came as the state is wrestling with an outbreak in Grand Forks that has shut down LM Power, a wind turbine manufacturing plant, that as of Monday had grown to 128 employees or associated people.
Ohio
Columbus: Inmates make up nearly 1 in 4 of the states coronavirus cases following a spike in identified infections as universal testing takes place inside three state prisons. Figures released Sunday show 1,828 positive tests at Marion Correctional Facility in north-central Ohio, out of about 2,500 total inmates, according to the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In addition, 109 employees at Marion have tested positive, out of a total of about 350 workers. One Marion prison guard died earlier this month. Systemwide, 2,400 inmates have tested positive, and six have died, including five at Pickaway Correctional Facility in central Ohio, where 384 inmates have tested positive out of a population of about 2,000. Even the head of the prison guards union, Christopher Mabe, is in self-quarantine after his wife, a guard at Lorain Correctional Institution, tested positive.

Tulsa: The term artist in residence has taken on new meaning as the populace confronts the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its probably safe to say that every artist these days is an artist in residence since they are having to stay at home just like everyone else, Lauren Rogers, communications specialist at Gilcrease Museum, told the Tulsa World. During a discussion about how the temporarily shuttered Gilcrease might still find ways to connect with audiences, staff came up with a plan. The first call for artists to contribute to the #ArtistsinQuarantine project went out March 20, and so far, more than 50 artists have responded. Gilcrease staff members selected certain images that it features regularly on its various social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Rogers said artists wishing to submit their work for the #ArtistsinQuarantine project may do so on any of the museums social media sites using the hashtag.
Oregon
Salem: Taproot Lounge &amp; Cafe and its second location, TAO (Taproot Annex One), are both closed until further notice, but the staff is far from idle. Taproot owner Christopher Toph Holland and his longtime friend Brian Sullivan are mobilizing out-of-work restaurant employees and community volunteers to sew face masks. We had a bunch of employees with nothing to do, Holland said, so if we cant serve (at the restaurant), well keep serving by doing something else. The project came about when the Centers for Disease Control updated recommendations, instructing individuals to wear face masks in public places. The City of Salem asked for the publics help sewing masks to be donated to local nonprofit organizations. In response, Sullivan and Holland reached out to friends, asking to borrow sewing machines and soliciting donations of fabric and notions.

Harrisburg: The state will ease some restrictions on building construction and vehicle sales, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday as hundreds of protesters defied a ban on mass gatherings to stage an anti-shutdown rally at the Capitol. Wolf announced a first, tentative step toward reopening the states economy after weeks of social distancing to combat the new virus, which has killed more than 1,200 Pennsylvania residents and sickened more than 33,000. Wolf said he was signing online-notary legislation that would pave the way for online vehicle sales. And limited building construction work may resume May 8, he said. We are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania, Wolf said. As he spoke, protesters gathered outside the state Capitol to demand that Wolf reopen the states virus-battered economy.

Providence: The Rhode Island COVID-19 Response Fund has distributed another $2.1 million to nonprofits across the state to help people struggling to pay for groceries, rent, utilities or health care during the coronavirus pandemic. The fund, established last month by the Rhode Island Foundation and United Way of Rhode Island, has now distributed about $6.7 million. Childrens Friend, the Jonnycake Center of Peace Dale, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, Progreso Latino and Thundermist Health Center are among the organizations that received grants ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 in the latest round of funding announced Monday. The need continues to grow, foundation President Neil Steinberg said. The need is beyond even what we expected, he said in a statement.

Columbia: Retail stores and public beach access points that had been closed to halt the spread of the coronavirus will be allowed to reopen this week, The Post and Courier reports. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster was issuing an order Monday to allow for the reopenings to take place Tuesday, the governors chief of staff, Trey Walker, told the newspaper. The order will apply to numerous nonessential stores, including department stores, flea markets, florists, bookstores and music shops. Grocery stores, pharmacies, home improvement stores and medical facilities have been allowed to stay open during the pandemic. Occupancy in each store will be limited to five customers per 1,000 square feet of retail space or 20% occupancy, whichever is less, the newspaper reports. Local governments will still be allowed to make their own rules about waterway access. Sullivans Island, Isle of Palms and Folly Beach are among those that have banned access to nonresidents.

Sioux Falls: Sanford Health says a critically ill patient has received a transfusion of plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient, the first use of the therapy by the health care provider. Sanfords treatment is part of a national clinical trial to test the effect of blood plasma in treating COVID-19. The use of plasma is for hospitalized patients with severe cases of coronavirus. The plasma may lessen severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by the virus. This is another step forward in our efforts to find effective treatments for this virus, said Dr. Allison Suttle, chief medical officer for Sanford Health. Its still early, but we are optimistic that the disease-fighting antibodies found in plasma could potentially slow the progression of the disease in our sickest patients. Because the therapy is still considered experimental, the plasma is being administered under a program led by Mayo Clinic.

Carthage: A truckload of medical masks and protective surgical gowns was destroyed when a tractor-trailer caught fire on a highway, news outlets report. First responders told WKRN-TV at the scene in Smith County on Saturday that N95 masks and special hospital gowns were among the items ruined. Shortages of these masks, which filter out 95% of all airborne particles, have created high demand among medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. It was unclear where the shipment was headed. Photos posted by news outlets on social media showed the frame of the charred vehicle smoking, with dozens of cardboard boxes strewn along the road reportedly carrying the masks. Green bundles that appeared to be surgical gowns were pictured laying in the wreckage. The fire started in a rear wheel and spread, officials told news outlets. The driver was not seriously injured, authorities said.

Corpus Christi: Many health care workers are taking precautions to protect their families from exposure to COVID-19, but one emergency room doctor is talking self-isolation to another level. Jason Barnes, 39, is a physician at Christus Spohn Hospital Beeville and Christus Spohn Hospital South. He couldnt risk exposing his wife, Jenna, and sons, Stiles and Bentley, to the coronavirus, so he packed his things and made his kids backyard treehouse a temporary home. Working in the emergency room, Barnes has treated patients who came in for problems, such as a hurt leg, only to find out they were infected with coronavirus. Barnes has now spent nearly three weeks in the cabin treehouse. Luckily the WiFi reaches the treehouse, so I have my laptop and my own little command center here, he said. His living situation is similar to camping. He started with a bucket as a toilet but now has a camping toilet with biodegradable bags.

Salt Lake City: A day before a large weekend rally that drew hundreds of people to protest the citys stay-at-home order, a man was arrested who police say threatened a civil war if Mayor Erin Mendenhall did not open up the city, according to charging documents. Marlin Richard Baer was arrested Friday on suspicion of making a terrorist threat and electronic communication harassment after he made the phone call to Mendenhalls office demanding that she cancel the stay-at-home order she invoked March 29, police said. He was arrested before he could attend a rally Saturday at city hall that he referenced in his call that drew about 1,000 demonstrators. Baer mentioned the rally in his call and said if things didnt change, a civil war would be coming, and police wouldnt stop him, the charging document alleges. Baer also commented on Facebook that people should bring guns to the rally. 
Vermont
Montpelier: More than 8,300 checks for $1,200 were being sent Monday to people whose unemployment claims were delayed due to a variety of administrative issues, according to the Vermont Department of Labor. The checks were prepared over the weekend after officials were unable to resolve stringent federal requirements that kept those individuals from receiving regular unemployment payments. Given the overwhelming demand on the system, being able to provide timely claims processing while meeting all federal standards became virtually impossible, interim Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington said in a news release issued late Sunday. Ultimately, we needed to put people over process and get people their benefits. The checks provide two weeks of federal benefits approved to help people affected by COVID-19-related layoffs. The department says the checks likely do not provide the full amount owed but serve as an initial installment.
Virginia
Falls Church: For the third straight day, health authorities are reporting a drop in the states number of new coronavirus cases. Numbers released Monday by the Virginia Department of Health show 453 new coronavirus cases reported in the prior 24 hours, bringing the total to 8,990. The death toll increased from 277 to 300. The drop in new cases marks the first time since the virus arrived in Virginia that the state has reported three consecutive days of declines, according to data kept by the Virginia Public Access Project. Northam and federal officials have indicated they want to see a 14-day trend of declining cases before phasing in an end to the restrictions on businesses that Northam imposed in a series of executive orders to fight the spread of the virus. Also Monday, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it is stepping up coronavirus testing at state prisons. The state health department was sending staff into prisons Monday to facilitate the increased testing.

Seattle: Boeing this week is restarting production of commercial airplanes in the Seattle area, putting about 27,000 people back to work after operations were halted because of the coronavirus. The aerospace giant says it is taking extra precautions and has instituted comprehensive procedures at all of its sites to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new virus-slowing measures will include the use of face masks and other protective equipment, hand-washing sites, staggered shift times and employee wellness checks. Employees for the 737, 747, 767 and 777 airplanes were to return as early as Monday, with most returning to work by Tuesday, officials said. Employees for the 787 program will return next Thursday and Friday. Boeings shutdown went into effect March 25 after workers tested positive for the virus and a longtime inspector for the company died.
West Virginia
Huntington: An annual fundraiser at Marshall University to help feed needy families has moved online. Marshall says its art school is teaming up with a pottery studio for the Empty Bowls alternative event. The school said in a news release that the Pottery Place of Huntington has more than 500 bowls and T-shirts listed on its website. The bowls were made by Marshall ceramics students, but some were not finished before the school and the fundraiser were shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. The bowls and T-shirts cost $15 apiece. Purchased items can be picked up at the store. Proceeds will go to the Facing Hunger Foodbank, which serves 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio. Last years fundraiser raised a record $18,000. Pottery Place owner Jessica Stone, a 2004 Marshall graduate, was part of a group of ceramics students who launched Empty Bowls 17 years ago.
Wisconsin
Madison: The Tavern League of Wisconsin is calling on Gov. Tony Evers to allow bars and restaurants to reopen May 1, more than three weeks ahead of the end of the current stay-at-home order that has forced the closure of most nonessential businesses. The lobbying group argued in a statement late Sunday that bars, restaurants and supper clubs could reopen by implementing a variety of safety measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19. Those steps include requiring all employees to wear masks and gloves; not allowing anyone to be closer than 6 feet from one another; spacing all tables at least 6 feet apart; not allowing more than six people to sit at any one table; and reducing the number of people allowed inside by 50%. The group also said it would eliminate paper menus, all table condiments and salad bars in order to reopen early. There will have to be a decrease in positive coronavirus cases over 14 days before the state can start a phased reopening of nonessential businesses, Evers said Monday when releasing new criteria for when the state will begin to reopen.
Wyoming
Jackson: Since early March, the countys top health official has been begging the state to support his restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus in Teton County. Emails obtained by the Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide through the Wyoming Public Records Act show a back-and-forth that became heated as Teton District Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell pushed state officials to allow him to enact a stay-at-home order. Riddell initially sought the states blessing for an order narrowly tailored to just the most vulnerable people seniors and those with underlying medical conditions. But Senior Assistant Attorney General Jackson Engels fought back. Jackson Hole, he wrote, was not as unique as Riddells order suggested. While stating support for county-level orders, Gov. Mark Gordon has avoided imposing a statewide stay-at-home order, leaving Wyoming as one of eight states without such a decree.

Montgomery: The first Alabama prisoner has died after testing positive for the new coronavirus, the state Department of Corrections reported Friday as it confirmed two other COVID-19 cases among inmates. Dave Thomas, 66, whom the prison system described as already terminally ill, died Thursday at a hospital within 24 hours of testing positive for COVID-19, the department said. Thomas, who had been housed at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, had been hospitalized since April 4 to receive critical care related to his preexisting conditions. Another inmate at St. Clair and an inmate at Bullock County Correctional Facility have also tested positive for COVID-19. The state said it has quarantined a group of inmates out of one dormitory at St. Clair and quarantined an entire dormitory at Bullock.
Alaska
Juneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the state will chart its own course in deciding how to reopen parts of the economy restricted or shut down because of concerns about the coronavirus. Well continue to look at this through the lens of Alaska and what Alaska needs, the Republican said late Thursday, noting unique aspects of the state, including isolated communities that lack the health care infrastructure of other places. Dunleavy said the state continues to build up its testing capacity, and its chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, has said that testing and testing broadly will be important as the state weighs easing restrictions. State officials have announced plans to lift in phases restrictions on health care activities, a process that includes calls for testing ahead of certain procedures and testing to the extent possible of patients admitted to facilities such as hospitals and long-term care centers.
Arizona
Tucson: The University of Arizona is implementing furloughs and pay cuts for most of its employees as a result of economic strains brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. The university posted details about the furloughs on its website, saying the changes will begin May 11 and remain in effect until June 30, 2021. The amount of furlough days will be based on an employees annual salary. For example, those who make less than $44,450 a year can expect 13 furlough days, while those who make more will have to take off without pay between 26 and 39 days. Employees who make more than $150,000 will see pay cuts ranging from 17% to 20%. The university, which projects it could lose $250 million as a result of the pandemic, is one of southern Arizonas largest employers. 
Arkansas
Little Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has announced the creation of a task force to help the state recover economically from restrictions that were put in place to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The task force will be led by Steuart Walton, the grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Walmart is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. The group will focus on helping small businesses because thats where we want to be able to get back to work, Hutchinson said at a news conference Saturday. During the pandemic, the governor did not issue a statewide stay-at-home order but imposed other restrictions that closed businesses such as gyms and casinos. He also prohibited sit-down service at restaurants and bars. On Friday, Hutchinson said he hoped to lift some restrictions imposed on businesses during the pandemic if Arkansas meets certain criteria. The task force will hold its first meeting this week.
California
San Francisco: Fears of getting infected with the coronavirus have prompted authorities in Northern California to allow some sexual assault victims to collect evidence with a nurse directing them in the hours­long process through a video call. The temporary measure put in place in Monterey County after shelter-in-place orders were issued last month to stop the spread of the virus raises issues of evidence contamination and other problems that would be challenged in court, defense attorneys said. Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Lana Nassoura said the temporary measure doesnt apply to victims of sexual assault who are children or who have been injured and is allowed when the victim is comfortable and able to conduct the forensic examination on themselves. She said the measure also aims to protect the nurses who lack the proper equipment to protect them from exposure to the virus.

Colorado Springs: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has announced the Colorado National Guard will be sent into three of the states largest nursing homes to conduct coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment identified COVID-19 outbreaks at 100 different facilities across the state, including 10 in Colorado Springs where 13 residents have died from complications due to the new virus and another five are suspected, The Gazette reports. More than 520 patients have tested positive at nonhospital health care facilities, and at least 138 patients have died, department officials said last week. Colorado began visitation restrictions and started implementing screenings into senior facilities last month. I think the toll would be far worse had that not been put in place, Polis said. The protocols that were putting in place are really about providing additional education and training to staff to keep the facility safe.
Connecticut
Bridgeport: A lawyer said Saturday that he is suing Gov. Ned Lamont over his executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in public places wherever close contact is unavoidable to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Stamford attorney Lindy Urso said he filed a lawsuit in federal court saying the order announced by Lamont on Friday is unconstitutional because it infringes on peoples individual freedoms and liberties. Urso claims the number of deaths in the U.S. linked to COVID-19 is artificially inflated and accuses government officials and the media of stirring up fear about the virus. A spokesman for the Democratic governor declined to comment Saturday. Lamonts order on face coverings takes effect at 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Delaware
Dover: State authorities say the death of a 73-year-old inmate is the first theyve seen from complications of the coronavirus. Joseph Russo died Thursday at Bayhealth Hospitals Kent campus. Initially, though, authorities were unsure if his death was attributable to the coronavirus because two previous tests had come back negative. The state Department of Corrections said Friday that a third test showed Russo was indeed infected with the virus. Russo was an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, the states largest prison. He was at the prison until Monday, when he was transferred to the hospital. Russo was part of a minimum-security housing unit of 45 inmates that has been closely monitored by security and medical staff since April 8. State figures show 20 inmates and roughly 20 staffers at Delaware prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus so far.
District of Columbia
Washington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and education officials say distance learning will continue throughout the 2019-2020 school year in response to the coronavirus crisis, WUSA-TV reports. The D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools academic year will end early May 29. Bowser has extended the districts stay-at-home order and public health emergency until May 15 to aid in flattening the curve and to save lives from the coronavirus. The extension applies to distance learning for D.C. schools, telework for D.C.s nonessential employees and the stay-at-home order. Nonessential businesses are to remain closed until May 15. Bowser also gave additional guidance for wearing masks in the district, saying face coverings are required in grocery stores, hotels, taxis, ride-shares and other private transportation, and theyre strongly encouraged for workers and riders of public transit.

Tallahassee: A man encased himself in concrete Friday outside the Governors Mansion in the state capital, apparently to protest prison conditions related to the coronavirus. Tallahassee police spokesman Kevin Bradshaw said the man, identified as 28-year-old Jordan Mazurek, put PVC pipes horizontally into two 55-gallon plastic drums filled with concrete, with some sort of mechanism that locked his arms in place. Mazurek was first spotted about 6 a.m. outside the fence surrounding the mansion and was eventually freed about 10:30 a.m. One of Mazureks drums was painted in white letters with the words Stop the massacre. The other read, Free prisoners now. The man also wore what appeared to be a surgical mask. Mazurek is a sociologist originally from Forth Worth, Texas, who now lives in Florida and is a co-creator of a group called Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons. Mei Azaad, a spokeswoman for the group, said it did not organize the protest but was aware of it.
Georgia
Albany: A brewery in one of the communities most affected by the coronavirus is thanking police with donations of home-brewed hand sanitizer. The Pretoria Fields Collective donated 200 bottles of the alcohol-based sanitizer to the Albany Police Department, the Dougherty County Police Department and the Dougherty County Sheriffs Office, WALB-TV reports. The county of roughly 90,000 residents has seen rates of infection from the new virus that far exceed those in Georgias more densely populated communities such as metro Atlanta. Pretoria Fields typically brews craft beer but pivoted to producing hand sanitizer to help offset shortages during the pandemic. We wanted to do something to show the law enforcement our appreciation for putting their lives on the line, Pretoria Field manager Tony Singletary said.
Hawaii
Honolulu: Gov. David Ige on Friday ordered a moratorium on evictions of people from their homes for failure to pay rent as the negative economic effects of the fight against the coronavirus deepen. Evictions in Hawaii have effectively been on hold since mid-March because the state judiciary had curtailed court proceedings to limit the viruss spread. But Ige said he believed the prohibition needed to be more explicit. It strengthens the intent and ensures that evictions cannot occur and that those trying to evict someone would be subject to a fine or a penalty, Ige said at a news conference. The social distancing requirements instituted to slow the virus have closed hotels, restaurants and retail stores across Hawaii. The state has received more than 240,000 unemployment benefit claims since March 1, which amounts to more than one-third of Hawaiis labor force.

Boise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered at the Statehouse on Friday afternoon in defiance of Gov. Brad Littles extension of the statewide stay-at-home order. Little announced Wednesday that the order would extend to the end of April in the effort to slow the spread of coronavirus, although he lightened some restrictions so nonessential businesses could begin providing curbside service. Still, the news was met with derision by some members of the far-right in Idaho, and some libertarian, gun-rights and anti-vaccine organizations began directing members to defy the order. The Idaho Freedom Foundation, a libertarian think tank and lobbying group, emblazoned its social media feeds with Disobey Idaho graphics and announced it would host Fridays rally along with Health Freedom Idaho and the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance.
Illinois
Chicago: The University of Illinois has allowed medical students to graduate early as the pressing need for health care workers has increased amid the coronavirus outbreak. Graduates could start their residency programs early, the Chicago Tribune reports. When we saw the way the pandemic was affecting the nation, we asked how we could provide physicians to the workforce as quickly as possible, said Dr. Mark Rosenblatt, executive dean of the college. And when you look at the type of students we have and why they went to med school in the first place, its to help people. Earlier this month, Shivam Vedak marked his early graduation from the College of Medicine on a Zoom call. He and a cohort of the 191 graduates pledged to dedicate their lives to the service of humanity. Ive never felt so validated in my decision to become a physician, Vedak said.

Evansville: A southwestern Indiana hospital is fitting newborns with tiny plastic face shields to protect them from the coronavirus. Berry Global, the Evansville-based plastic packaging company, delivered a working prototype to Deaconess Womens Hospital on Tuesday. The next day the hospital began using the shields. Officials expect to have about 100 on hand. I cant believe how fast they picked up on the idea and had something for us to try, hospital CEO Chris Ryan said. She said officials are doing anything possible to shield babies from exposure to the virus, given that newborns are susceptible to airborne germs when they travel around the hospital in an open bassinet for routine postnatal procedures. Wed rather err on the side of being more cautious than not, she said. Berry has also adapted the shield design to fit toddlers and younger children.
Iowa
Des Moines: State officials will not call schools back into session this year, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday. The state has not reached its peak of positive coronavirus cases yet, and data doesnt indicate its safe to reopen schools, Reynolds said. I regret to say that Iowa schools will not reopen for this school year. But school districts will be required to continue to provide continuous learning opportunities for their students until the end of the regular school year, she said. Believe me, I would like nothing more than to stand before you today and announce that Iowa will be open for school in May. Most school districts would have held classes through late May, and some end their year in early June. The announcement also cancels spring sports activities. State education officials say they will release information June 1 about whether school-sponsored activities, including summer sports, can resume.
Kansas
Topeka: The state plans to start using 3D printers to manufacture its own swabs to test for the novel coronavirus as officials look to improve the states near-bottom national rank in testing before lifting a stay-at-home order. Gov. Laura Kelly and her top public health administrator, Dr. Lee Norman, have complained for weeks that Kansas isnt a priority for testing supplies and personal protective equipment from the federal government or even private vendors, making it difficult to get them. The states struggles have continued with the Democratic governor under increasing pressure from the Republican-controlled Legislature to lift restrictions hindering economic activity, with her stay-at-home order set to remain in place until May 3. But Kelly said Friday that testing people both with and without symptoms is key. Kansas as of Friday had reported testing about 5.8 of every 1,000 residents, the second-lowest rate among all states, just behind Virginia.
Kentucky
Louisville: A federal judge has denied Maryville Baptist Churchs motion for a restraining order blocking enforcement of Gov. Andy Beshears order barring faith-based mass gatherings. The church filed a lawsuit Friday saying that enforcement of the order discriminates against its rights under the First Amendment and the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act by prohibiting mass gatherings that are faith-based. But U.S. District Judge David Hale said Beshears order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 bans all mass gatherings i.e., any event or convening that brings together groups of individuals, including civic, public, leisure, faith-based, or sporting events as well as concerts, festivals and conventions. For that reason, Hale said it doesnt discriminate against religion. In a seven-page opinion, he also noted that other forms of group worship are permitted, such as drive-in, online, video or telephone conferencing and radio and TV broadcasts.

New Orleans: The state is working to make more clinic and hospital space available again for elective surgeries and other nonemergency medical care before May 1, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday. Elective surgeries and other procedures were largely put on hold as state hospitals converted space and clinic personnel were diverted to other jobs as Louisiana ramped up to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The state has the third-highest rate of cases in the country, Edwards said. But the number of those requiring hospitalization and ventilators has declined in recent days, raising hopes that an easing of economically devastating stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns may soon be in sight. Edwards said details on the return of more nonemergency services would be released this week. 
Maine
Northeast Harbor: It wasnt the destination wedding theyd planned, but a couple found a way to tie the knot in the middle of a pandemic. Bradley Gray and Teresa Norwood Gray got hitched Thursday at a drive-thru window at a local bank in their hometown. I threw it out there kind of as a joke at first. Then the more we talked about it, were like, oh, maybe thatll work, Bradley Gray said. The officiant was inside the bank, behind the glass at the teller window. The happy couple stood outside, where they exchanged their vows. Guests in the parking lot practiced social distancing. Teresa Norwood Grays son walked her down the aisle. Local teens provided the music. Passing motorists stopped to watch. Everyone needs a little lifting up right now. So the community really came together, she said. It gave them something to smile about. The novel coronavirus also ruined their honeymoon, as they were supposed to be departing Saturday on a cruise to the Caribbean, but the happy couple is making the best of it, heading to the grooms cabin in Maine. Its not quite as warm as the Caribbean, but well make it work, Bradley Gray said.
Maryland
Baltimore: The NAACP in the city has started circulating a sound truck blasting requests to stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic. The truck, which features messages from local celebrities, politicians and athletes, has started driving around areas where residents have continued to gather despite Gov. Larry Hogans stay-at-home order, The Baltimore Sun reports. The messages tell people to remain in their homes when possible, practice social distancing guidelines, wash their hands frequently and wear masks. Spokesman Joshua Harris said the 40-foot sound truck made its first rounds Wednesday and will target low-income and hard-to-reach areas of the city for 6 to 8 hours a day in the upcoming weeks. Baltimore Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said there has also been prevalent misinformation that the virus does not affect African Americans, who make up 60% of the citys population and have in fact been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
Massachusetts
Chelsea: Physicians with Massachusetts General Hospital said theyve found widespread evidence of exposure to the new coronavirus in this small Boston-area city. Nearly a third of 200 Chelsea residents who gave a drop of blood to researchers last week tested positive for antibodies linked to the virus, the Boston Globe reports. The participants seemed to be healthy, but half told doctors they experienced at least one symptom in the past four weeks. Massachusetts has been hit hard by the virus. More than 1,500 people have died, and a total of 36,372 people have tested positive for the virus. The state hit a new high for deaths in a single day on Friday with 159. Dr. John Iafrate, vice chairman of MGHs pathology department and the studys principal investigator, told the Globe that Chelsea is in the midst of a raging epidemic but is also probably further along in the outbreak than other communities.

Detroit: A prisoner who declined to be paroled earlier this year after decades behind bars has died from COVID-19 complications, officials said. William Garrison is one of at least 17 Michigan prisoners who have died from COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Corrections Department said. Garrison, 60, could have left prison on parole weeks ago. But he decided to wait until September, when he would be eligible for a complete release without the rigors of parole supervision. After nearly 44 years in prison, he was trying to get free, said sister Yolanda Peterson. Garrison, however, changed his stance during the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 500 inmates in Michigan prisons. The parole board approved his application in March. Garrison died Monday while waiting to see if prosecutors would challenge it, a standard step that can take weeks.
Minnesota
Wayzata: About three dozen residents have been moved from a Minneapolis-area senior living facility after an outbreak of the coronavirus made many staff members too sick to care for residents. The Minnesota Department of Health told the Star Tribune the decision to relocate residents from Meridian Manor in Wayzata on Saturday came in consultation with state and local officials. The department said a majority of staff members and administrators at the 50-bed facility became sick and were unable to care for residents. Five residents were sent to a hospital, some residents were relocated with family, and others were being moved to a nearby long-term care facility. In a statement, Meridian Manor said residents began testing positive for the coronavirus at the hospital April 7. As of Saturday, 18 of 55 had tested positive. On Friday, one resident died because of complications with COVID-19, the facility said.
Mississippi
Jackson: The state is reporting a dozen more deaths from COVID-19 as its total cases approach 4,000. The state Department of Health reported the new numbers Saturday, bringing the total number of deaths in Mississippi to 152. Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he is extending his statewide stay-at-home order by one week to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order has been in place since the evening of April 3, and it originally was set to expire Monday morning. The extension expires April 27. Reeves said Mississippi is in the worst, hardest part of the curve of virus cases. I know we cannot stay in this position for much longer, but we are still in the eye of the storm, Reeves said. He said he will allow lakes and beaches to open starting Monday, but people will not be allowed to go in large groups.
Missouri
OFallon: A lawsuit filed by civil rights groups Friday seeks to allow all Missourians to vote absentee in upcoming elections to help reduce the risk of catching or spreading the coronavirus. The lawsuit was filed in Jefferson City by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition on behalf of the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and several residents. It claims that requiring voters to appear at traditional polling places during the pandemic puts lives at risk. No one should be forced to choose between staying safe and voting, Sophia Lin Lakin, deputy director of the ACLUs Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. Missouri law allows absentee voting, but only for people with certain reasons, such as illness or travel away from home on the day of the election. Municipal elections will be June 2, Missouris primary election is Aug. 4, and the general election is Nov. 3.
Montana
Helena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday that he plans to begin a phased reopening of the states economy after April 24, when the current stay-at-home directives expire, but he didnt provide specifics about what that means. Details about plans to begin easing restrictions that have been in place for several weeks will be announced by the middle of this week, Bullock said. The governor said hes been working with business leaders and public health experts to determine how the states economy could be reopened while keeping people safe and avoiding another outbreak of coronavirus. Because Montanans took the stay-at-home and social distancing directives so seriously, the state is in a position to begin reopening its economy in a time when a whole lot of states still wont be able to, Bullock said. But even as we reopen facets or remove some of these directives, there will be expectations of things like social distancing and masks. 
Nebraska
Lincoln: Local farmers markets likely will focus on solo shoppers and not be their traditional family affair when they open this spring, a health department official said. Recommendations from the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department to allow operation of these markets include more hand-washing stations, increased space between vendor booths, a ban on free samples and stricter money-handling guidelines, among others. I know it totally changes the tenor of the thing, said Scott Holmes, environmental public health director for the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. But the department wants to allow these key access points for healthy food to be open while also reducing the transmission risk of the coronavirus in Lincoln, he told the Lincoln Journal Star. Health officials plan to soon review the recommendations with market managers, who remain uncertain when theyll be able to convene their vendors for the start of the seasonal attractions.

Carson City: Hundreds of people protested at the State Capitol on Saturday, demanding that Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak reopen the states economy and lift a stay-at-home order that he imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. News media video showed protesters parading on a sidewalk carrying U.S. flags and signs displaying messages such as Open Nevada and Stop the Tyranny. Meanwhile, others in cars honked the vehicles horns. In other coronavirus developments, the Clark County School District has announced graduation will be postponed for the class of 2020. The southern Nevada school district made the announcement Friday in a districtwide email sent to families stating that each school will develop its own celebration plans following federal and state health guidelines and restrictions.

Concord: A few hundred demonstrators cheered and waved signs outside the New Hampshire State House on Saturday during a call to reopen the state. Members of the crowd carried signs with slogans such as Live Free or Die, the states motto. Others included Restore Jobs and Kiss My Constitution. One demonstrator, talk show host Ian Freeman, said that the government was guilty of fear-mongering over the state of the virus and that it was time to restore individual rights. Even if the virus were 10 times as dangerous as it is, I still wouldnt stay inside my home. Id rather take the risk and be a free person, he said. Meanwhile, the ACLU of New Hampshire and national ACLU said they have filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court seeking the release of all Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainees from Strafford County Department of Corrections in Dover. The ACLU said its impossible to maintain safe social distance at the facility.
New Jersey
Trenton: The state says more than 4,000 people have died during the coronavirus outbreak, but the governor is reporting signs of progress. Gov. Phil Murphy announced Saturday another 231 deaths among those who have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 4,070. Another 3,026 cases were announced, bringing the statewide total to 81,420, he said. We are flattening the curve, Murphy said, presenting charts showing the rate of growth of new cases over the previous 21 days as well as daily rates of new hospitalizations since the beginning of the month. The slower the rate of new cases, the slower the rate of infections, the slower the rate of new hospitalizations, ICU beds required, ventilators required and, please, God, fatalities that result, Murphy said. Were now reporting more people leaving the hospital than entering please, God, it stays that way.
New Mexico
Albuquerque: Nearly 40 of the citys police officers have been placed on quarantine after being exposed to a law enforcement officer who recently tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the department. Police said two civilian workers with the department also were exposed. Police officials said the 39 officers experienced different levels of exposure to the infected officer over the course of several days, including during a multi-agency operation. The officers who may have been exposed to the virus were tested and placed into quarantine. Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos told KOB-TV that officials still are waiting for the test results. Mayor Tim Keller announced a new three-tiered system last week to help protect police officers from the coronavirus. In addition to current protocols, area commanders were directed to spend time over the weekend ensuring their officers are wearing masks during encounters with the public.

New York: The coronavirus death toll in the state has dropped again, a sign Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday means that New York is on the other side of the plateau and that ongoing social distancing practices are working to stem the spread of the virus. Cuomo said 507 people died Saturday, down 43 from the previous day. Hospitalizations and other medical indicators are trending downward. But Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus. We showed that we can control the beast, and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime, Cuomo said Sunday. We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down, we keep that hospitalization rate down as we all get very eager to get on with life and move on.
North Carolina
Goldsboro: A COVID-19 outbreak at a state prison has spread to more than 250 inmates, prison officials said Friday. State prisons Commissioner Todd Ishee said during a media briefing that 259 inmates had tested positive as of Friday afternoon at Neuse Correctional Institution, a state prison in Goldsboro. He said none required hospitalization, and 98% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. All 700 inmates have been tested, but some test results are pending. Ishee said no coronavirus-related deaths had been reported at any of the states prisons. The outbreak at Neuse CI is no doubt a cause for concern but not for panic. We have medical protocols in place to handle this, Ishee said in an earlier statement. Inmates testing positive are being separated from others, and the state is sending additional medical and security staff to the facility.
North Dakota
Bismarck: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has risen to 585, with the biggest jump coming in northeastern North Dakota, where a wind turbine plant has been temporarily idled during an outbreak of COVID-19. The North Dakota Department of Health on Sunday reported 34 new cases in Grand Forks County, where the LM Wind Power facility is based in Grand Forks. Health officials did not report how many of the new cases are connected to the plant, where 110 cases were reported in early testing. Statewide, the number of new cases rose by 57, with Cass County second with 15 new cases. North Dakota also reported one new death, a woman in her 70s from Cass County with underlying medical conditions, bringing the states total to 10. Fifty-one people have been hospitalized, up four from Saturday. The state has tested 13,630 people since the first test was confirmed in early March.
Ohio
Columbus: The governor is calling on the federal government to help provide crucial materials that would allow a dramatic increase in testing for coronavirus in his state. Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press that Ohio hospitals doing the testing lack needed chemicals known as reagents, and help from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is needed. I could probably double, maybe even triple testing in Ohio virtually overnight, said DeWine, who called on the FDA to prioritize companies that are putting a slightly different formula together for the extraction reagent kit. In a more direct appeal, he said: Anybody in the FDA is watching, this would really take our capacity up literally overnight. DeWine, a Republican, referred to his having sought help several weeks ago with an issue involving sterilization of masks, and he said President Donald Trump got that done.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City: If the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the state continues to trend downward, some businesses could begin to open back up as early as May 1, Gov. Kevin Stitt said Friday. Stitt said at a news conference that the state is continuing to ramp up its testing capacity and dedicating more resources to contact tracing, in alignment with guidelines released by the Trump administration for reopening the countrys economy. Contact tracing involves interviewing those who have the coronavirus about their movements and contact with others. University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University medical students are assisting with the project. If our positive trends continue, we hope to share more details next week on how to roll that out, Stitt said. He said churches, retailers and restaurants are all working on plans on how to safely reopen their establishments.

Salem: Dozens of people protesting the states stay-at-home order drove around the Capitol on Friday, horns blaring, and a lawmaker asked the governor to ease restrictions for medical procedures for non-coronavirus patients. The protest in Salem was one of several happening across the country as conservatives push back against restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. State Rep. Cheri Helt, a moderate Republican from Bend, credited Gov. Kate Brown for imposing the stay-at-home order and social distancing. But she said in a letter its time to slowly and carefully begin lifting regulations that have essentially shut down access to health care and medical procedures in Central Oregon for anything unrelated to COVID-19. Helt noted that the order has affected the health care industry and patients who must wait for procedures.
Pennsylvania
Harrisburg: The state is starting curbside pickup at liquor stores a month after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered them closed as part of a broader shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board announced on its website Saturday that stores will begin taking orders by phone Monday, with each customer limited to no more than six bottles. Curbside pickup will be available at more than 175 of the states 600 stores. The closure of the state-owned liquor stores had been widely unpopular, especially with the states online ordering system largely unable to keep up with overwhelming consumer demand. The liquor board, which has a virtual monopoly on retail sales of hard alcohol in Pennsylvania, has been repurposing some of the stores to help fulfill online orders.
Rhode Island
Providence: The state is taking extra steps to protect residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities who are particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, state Department of Health Director Nicole Alexander-Scott said Friday. More than 90 of the people who have died in Rhode Island lived in what Alexander-Scott called congregate-care facilities. We are doing everything we can to keep them safe, she said. Measures either already in place or set for launch soon include isolation at the first sign of symptoms; aggressive and more frequent testing of residents and their caregivers every seven to 10 days; and the creation of strike teams that can be deployed to nursing homes that are experiencing outbreaks to aid the staff. The state will also provide support for families taking care of elderly relatives at home, she said.
South Carolina
Hilton Head: A theater thats closed because of the coronavirus is making a switch to showing movies online. Larry Mann and his wife have owned the Park Plaza Cinema on Hilton Head Island for more than a decade. Like other movie theaters in the U.S., theyve had to shut down amid efforts to prevent the new virus from spreading. The Island Packet reports the couple is revamping the theaters website to stream films not yet available on platforms such as Netflix. Mann says streaming movies on his site will generally cost about $12. Initial offerings will include The Roads Not Taken starring Javier Bardem and Elle Fanning and the rock documentary Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band. If we could figure out how to get everyone popcorn, we would do that, too, Mann said.
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: An employee at the Minnehaha Juvenile Detention Center has tested positive for COVID-19, the facilitys director said Saturday. Detention center director Jamie Gravett told the Associated Press that the Sioux Falls facility was informed of the positive test Friday and immediately began informing guardians, our partners and contractors while caring for our youth and keeping them safe. Staff and juveniles are being monitored for symptoms and have their temperatures taken twice each day, she said. The center in March put restrictions on visitors and began using enhanced sanitation procedures, Gravett said. The facility currently has 29 juveniles and 50 staff members. With statewide cases on the rise, the National Guard said it has selected locations for two 100-bed temporary hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, one in Sioux Falls and one in Rapid City.
Tennessee
Chattanooga: The mayor is reversing course to allow drive-in church services during the coronavirus pandemic after the city was sued over its ban. Mayor Andy Berke confirmed the change in policy Saturday on Twitter. The conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom recently filed a federal lawsuit over the drive-in church ban on behalf of Chattanooga-based Metropolitan Tabernacle Church. Every week I sign a new executive order. I have spoken to pastors who assured me they could operate drive in church safely, with spaces between the cars and no collection plates, Berke wrote on Twitter. This weeks order therefore permits drive in church. Please observe safely. The lawsuit followed Berkes declaration that drive-in religious services would violate the citys shelter-in-place directive that has been in place since April 2.

Bikers and runners have flouted a city ban on bike trails, part of a stay-at-home order to slow the spread of COVID-19. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered state parks to reopen Monday with the exception of El Paso, where local officials say the spread of the disease is still too fast.

Austin: The state is easing restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday, starting this week by letting retailers sell items for curbside pickup, resuming elective surgeries and reopening state parks. But Texas tiptoeing toward restarting one of the worlds largest economies immediately ran into new questions and skepticism and came as Abbott faces pressure from both conservatives who are eager to get Texas back to work and Democrats who are wary of going too quickly. Texas ranks last in the U.S. in coronavirus testing per capita, according to an analysis by the Associated Press of data collected by the COVID Tracking Project. Abbott said future decisions on reopening more of Texas would be guided by testing, and although he assured that testing would go up quite a bit in late April or early May, he did not provide a number.
Utah
Salt Lake City: Salt Lake County officials reported a COVID-19 outbreak Friday at a homeless center for men near Salt Lake City where 94 of 205 people tested positive. Six of the men were taken to a hospital, two were treated and released, and four remained hospitalized in stable condition, said Ilene Risk, epidemiology manager at the Salt Lake County health department. While this finding is truly unfortunate, its not especially surprising because the group living setting like this one is similar to a big household, Risk said. We tend to see household transmission at rates of about 25-50%. Officials had hoped to prevent an outbreak by doing extra cleaning of the facility and daily temperature screenings of residents. The county health department said in a statement that it is putting a plan in place to prevent other cases but acknowledged that maintaining social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading is difficult in a building that has up to 300 people.
Vermont
Montpelier: The New England Foundation for the Arts has awarded $47,000 to the Vermont Arts Council to support artists struggling financially amid the coronavirus outbreak, the council said. The funds will supplement an artists relief fund the council started last month to provide grants of up to $500 to artists who are having financial difficulty due to the loss of a job or cancellation of concerts, festivals, theatrical performances and other arts events due to COVID-19, the council said. The council received 183 requests for emergency relief funding in the first week and by April 15 had awarded 164 grants totaling more than $64,000. The applications are temporarily closed and will reopen for a new round of requests Wednesday. From touring musicians who have lost all gigs for the foreseeable future to teaching artists whose residencies have been canceled this semester, Vermonts working artists are hurting, Executive Director Karen Mittelman said.
Virginia
Richmond: The state has reduced its jail population by 17% in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday. Northam said the jail population in the state was 24,000 on April 7, down 17% from March 1. Virginia has also seen a 67% decline in the number of new commitments for misdemeanors across the state. Northam said the reduction was achieved through various steps, including decreasing the number of low-risk offenders being held without bail in jails, diverting offenders from being admitted into jails before trial by using summonses in lieu of arrests, and using alternatives to jail such as home electronic monitoring. Critics, however, say the state hasnt moved quickly enough to reduce the number of people being held in state prisons, which are considered high-risk locations for the spread of the virus. 
Washington
Seattle: A King County Metro bus driver who worked in a highly populated area that includes Seattle has died after contracting the coronavirus. Metro in a statement to The Seattle Times confirmed the death Thursday of 59-year-old Samina Hameed. Metro and our entire community are deeply thankful for their service, Metro officials said. Our thoughts are with their family, friends and colleagues, as we look to do everything we can to support them. Hameed had been a Metro employee since 2017. Her husband is also a Metro operator, and the two have three children. Hameed is the first Metro bus driver to die during the pandemic. Transit is deemed an essential service, but drivers typically come in contact with the public and have an increased chance of contracting the virus.
West Virginia
Charleston: Another nursing home resident has died due to the coronavirus, pushing the states confirmed death count to 19, officials said Sunday. The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department confirmed the death of a male patient from the Eastbrook Rehabilitation Center in Charleston. The patient tested positive for the virus earlier this month and had been receiving care at a hospital, Eastbrook operator Stonerise Healthcare said in a statement. On Saturday, the state Department of Health and Human Resources reported the virus-related deaths of an 83-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman from Eldercare Health and Rehabilitation in the Jackson County community of Ripley. The number of reported deaths in the state from the coronavirus has more than doubled in the past week.

Milwaukee: There was new testing and protesting in the state Saturday as the number of COVID-19 cases rose to nearly 4,200 and the death toll increased to 212. Hundreds of demonstrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Brookfield to protest Gov. Tony Evers decision to extend Wisconsins stay-at-home order through May 26. The group is calling for the reopening of churches, parks and the state economy. Some wore masks and elected to participate in parking lots, while the majority stood together on the sidewalk waving. Several showed off campaign signs, flags and bumper stickers for President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, two separate teams were busy investigating COVID-19 cases, one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and another from the state National Guard. Brown County officials said the CDC was making its way to the Green Bay area to look into a more than fourfold surge of COVID-19 cases in just 10 days. 
Wyoming
Cheyenne: Testing ability and statistics rather than a schedule will determine when places in the state ordered closed to limit the spread of the coronavirus will be allowed to reopen, Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday. Gordon has prohibited gatherings of 10 or more people and ordered the closure of schools and many types of businesses through April 30. Gordon hasnt said whether he would extend that date or when on the calendar he might begin lifting restrictions. Its not really so much date-driven; its data-driven. Its more about how many tests well be able to give, how many positives, how many of those positives are community spread versus something else, Gordon told the Associated Press. Most of the U.S., including Wyoming, still lacks widespread testing capacity toward meeting newly outlined federal goals. We arent adequate on testing. Thats been one of our biggest bugaboos, Gordon said.

To flatten the curve of community spread in the cities we serve, we are suspending our Pool option in the US, Canada, London, and Paris. 
We are in contact with local leaders globally and expect to take similar action when needed elsewhere.
 Uber (@Uber) March 17, 2020
Uber announced that it would be suspending the UberPool option in the US and Canada, as well as Paris and London. Its also added an in-app message asking riders to reconsider non-essential trips, and to protect themselves and the driver by washing their hands and giving the driver distance.
Read: What the worlds biggest tech companies are doing to fight coronavirus
Uber has already been attempting to mitigate the situation for its drivers, including offering two weeks of financial assistance for any driver that must quarantine themselves, have tested positive for the virus, or have had their accounts suspended for public health reasons. Its also attempting to provide drivers still working with disinfectants, so they can keep their cars clean. As for Uber Eats, its waiving fees for independent restaurants that might be impacted by the social distancing.
Lyft is also suspending Shared rides on all markets starting today, saying, The health and safety of the Lyft community is our top priority. It also promised financial assistance to drivers affected by the coronavirus, but hasnt specified how much or for how long. In both cases, the companies have said theyll be taking cues from the authorities on how long to continue operations.
Hi Daniel, this applies to Shared rides only. Lyft will remain available to help people engage in essential activities, like helping healthcare workers get to work, or getting people to grocery stores. Well continue to base our decisions on the guidance of local and federal gov.
 Lyft (@lyft) March 17, 2020
Neither company is completely suspending business, which is probably for the best even assuming everyone is being assiduous with their social distancing, there will still be essential workers, like those in the healthcare industry. And people will likely still need to go to grocery stores and pharmacies. Everyone staying inside 24/7 is the dream, but not the reality. But at least users wont be in close quarters with too many other potential infectees.
The Independent Drivers Guild, a New York group that supports gig drivers, have been calling for a halt to carpooling services since the outbreak began. Organizer Tina Raveneau told the New York Post, At a time when health authorities are urging social distancing, app companies should not be packing five strangers in a van. For everyones health and safety, pool rides have to go.

As a result, they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with their civil responsibility to keep the public properly informed. We, as a whole, rely on that information for guidance in a pressing time such as this.
But the challenges brought on in the last few months have raised the question as to whether or not organizations are properly equipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude.
Hopefully, they can scale their responsiveness with the help of conversational artificial intelligence, technologies that help computers process and respond to text and voice input.
Identifying the issue
The unforeseen rate of change around the coronavirus epidemic requires global health organizations to push information to a large population around the clock. These entities do this via the media, the web, email, SMS or even cellular broadcast. But this information becomes stale very quickly, and theres no easy way for citizens to get timely, relevant and personalized updates to the crisis. Some of this burden falls on human agents via chat or voice, at physical call centers, to respond to the frontline of the issue answering to the public.
Given the nature of how COVID-19 spreads from person to person, it has become a challenge for employees to continue coming into the call centers since they would then be violating the social distancing guidelines, and as a result, run the risk of contracting and spreading the virus to those they come in contact with. Call centers have seen a major reduction in the number of employees readily available to assist and have throttled the responses to aid callers with COVID-19. This is even impacting emergency response call centers.
The physical limitation blends into the next issue, which concerns sheer volume. Since COVID-19 has become a global issue, it needs a solution on an equal scale to reach everyone. We have different needs in different parts of the country, and even the world. There have been far too many inquiries for call centers to handle, and when people seeking assistance reach health organizationsif they even get that farthe interactions with representatives are limited and less personalized to the needs of the individual.
Conversational AI is changing that.
Conversational AIs innovative approach
Several government health organizations have turned to conversational AI as their solution for the outpouring of calls from concerned citizens, while making sure they are providing personalized engagements.
Using a conversational AI system to battle the response around COVID-19 can fill the holes left by absent human agents and allow these call centers to function at their full potential while adhering to social distancing guidelines. For example, a call center that usually holds 300 employees can now only safely accommodate 50. The AI-driven virtual assistant at the frontline can easily be implemented to keep these agencies afloat.
Entities around the world are coming together for a speedy solution. For example, Facebook has called out to developers around the world to partner as part of their launch of a global program, which connects government health organizations and UN health agencies with developers to leverage Facebook and Messenger to more effectively share timely and accurate information, and speed up their responses to concerned citizens. Conversational AI developers have joined their effort by helping organizations with automating responses to commonly asked questions, assisting their staffall pro bono.
The main focus of a solution is to be interactive, conversational and fielding free form questions. Some efforts involve using email, SMS or social media posts to inform the public. In comparison, conversational AI provides an interactive medium that can give entities insight into how their constituents are dealing with the pandemic.
Interactions with conversational AI agents provide real-time insights to understand where there is a trend of unanswered questions and anxiety across different groups of people, such as test sites, turn-around time for results, common symptoms, location-sensitive recommendations and more. A showcase example is MyGov in India, the largest government to citizen digital infrastructure in the world. MyGov launched the MyGov Corona Hub with an interactive Facebook Messenger system: https://m.me/MyGovIndia. Promotion of this service is done via Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Twitter, and Telegram.
These systems can be used to create a digital pulse of a community, a region or an entire country. This is done first through interaction analysis, but then surveying the public with the current state of their experience, e.g., are you showing any of the following symptoms, does anyone in your household have a fever above 99 degrees, If youve tried to get a test, have you been successful.
They can also receive guidance on effectively sharing updates with their audiences and seamlessly handing off automated conversations to a live person when necessary. No matter the medium, it is key that we create a backchannel and re-engage the customer without restarting the journey at every point.It is important, as those who provide a service, to bring our minds together and make a collective effort to identify global solutions in times of need. Currently with more than half a million confirmed cases worldwide, according to Worldometer, conversational AI is a powerful solution to get in front of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will work to address the concerns of millions of citizens around the world, all while personalizing the experience along the way, keeping them informed, at ease, and more importantly, safe.

Buffeted by a global trade war, monetary policymakers were already spending down their “ammunition” to keep a sluggish world economy from slipping further, only to now face a new and unexpected blow from the rapidly spreading coronavirus that has sowed fear worldwide. 
On Friday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued a statement in which he said that while the U.S. economy remained strong, the virus ‘posed an evolving risk’ and the Fed stood ready to take action if needed. 
“The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,” Powell said. 
Powell’s comments came after days of central bankers around the globe emphasizing a wait-and-see approach, causing some head-scratching among analysts who thought the Fed needed to say something to soothe markets. 
“The Fed has bungled its message on the virus, has confused markets, and has painted itself into an untenable corner,” Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli said in a note earlier on Friday. “Unless the virus is contained quickly, rate cuts in March (if not sooner) and beyond are a base case, regardless of recent comments by various officials.” 
U.S. stocks pared losses slightly after Powell's comments, but the S&amp;P 500 index .SPX still closed lower for a seventh straight day. 
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION? 
How much central banks can do remains the central question. 
The Federal Reserve’s interest rates are already at low levels, trimmed three times last year as the Trump administration roiled markets in a trade battle with China. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, with interest rates below zero, may particularly struggle for a response effective against the type of trouble stemming from the coronavirus. 
Monetary policy is most potent in bolstering demand by lowering the cost of borrowing - it cannot restore global supply chains that have ground to a halt or convince people it is safe to go on a trip or for businesses to hold a sales convention. 
Still, monetary policymakers worldwide have braced to act even while arguing - perhaps hoping - for a base case in which the virus is contained reasonably soon. Markets may have fallen off a cliff, they note; the real economy has not. 
Goushi Kataoka, one of the most dovish members of the BOJ’s nine-member board, said he saw no immediate need to take monetary policy action in response to the virus outbreak. 
    “I don’t think the BOJ needs to take additional monetary easing steps now in response to the coronavirus outbreak. We need to first look at how serious the impact from the outbreak would be,” Kataoka told a news conference on Thursday. 
Central bankers in recent years have warned broadly that their “toolkit” is limited by globally low interest rates and lingering doubts that bond buying and other strategies will prove effective in another sharp downturn. They have more openly urged fiscal authorities to plan for a fuller use of the government’s taxing and spending powers to shoulder the burden of crisis response. 
To some extent, authorities were taking fiscal action. Officials in Europe were moving to ease business credit and lower taxes with temporary measures, and U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was being pressured by congressional leaders to lay out more explicitly any fiscal steps it might take to bolster the economy. 
RATE CUTS ON THE RADAR 
Still, whatever the scope for fiscal policy, investors seemed to think events are forcing monetary authorities toward some sort of response even if their firepower is limited. 
A Fed rate cut at the upcoming March 17-18 meeting is now seen as a near certainty, with some analysts expecting aggressive action and perhaps even an emergency step in the interim. Some market pricing showed the Fed hitting the zero bound again this year. 
“We anticipate that the Fed will cut rates by at least 50 basis points over the coming months, with our new baseline forecast expecting 25 basis point cuts at the next two meetings in March and April,” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note on Friday. 
Central banks have made clear they will be cautious. 
St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard on Friday said he was open to cutting interest rates “if the situation gets worse and there looks like there will be a major effect on the U.S. economy...But we would have to get to that juncture.” 
There was a similar show of unity among policymakers globally, with officials in Canada, Europe, Japan, Switzerland and elsewhere saying they stood ready to act if the virus remains uncontained. 
The Bank of Canada may show itself to be the first out of the gate with a response as it convenes a policy meeting next week. Economists polled by Reuters see no change in rates from the BOC, but money markets are now pricing a quarter point cut. 
The underlying forecast for policymakers globally is that the coronavirus would follow its course as have other viral outbreaks without bringing the world economy to a full stop. 
Bullard put his own parameters around that: seasonal flu kills hundreds of thousands annually, he noted, compared with a few thousand fatalities so far from COVID-19, suggesting investor fear may be running ahead of the facts and creating a baseline he intends to watch in assessing any rate cut. 
European policymakers have said they also believe it is too early to say whether a central bank response is appropriate. 
“This is a very complex monetary policy issue which, in my view, does not require acute monetary policy action,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Friday.

Andalusia: Police charged a woman with violating the states coronavirus stay-at-home order after she hosted a party at her home and coughed in the face of an officer who came to shut it down. Melanie Nicole Chambers, 39, hosted the party Monday night for one of her children, AL.com reports. When officers arrived to break up the soiree after they got a call about loud music in the area, Andalusia police said she became angry and told the responding officers to worry about other things. Police said Chambers then asked the nearly 50 partygoers if they had coronavirus before she purposefully coughed on an officer. This resulted in a charge of criminal assault with a bodily fluid, but Police Chief Paul Hudson has since said her actions dont meet the standards for that charge. As of Wednesday morning, the states Health Department said there were 5,327 coronavirus cases and 144 deaths from the virus in Alabama.
Alaska
Juneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavys administration has announced plans to begin allowing this week the limited reopening of restaurants, retail stores and other businesses that were shut down amid coronavirus concerns. Starting Friday, restaurants, retail outlets, hair and nail salons, and businesses that fell under the category of nonessential will be allowed to reopen, with limited services. Bars, theaters, bowling alleys and bingo halls will not be allowed to reopen yet, the states health commissioner, Adam Crum, said Tuesday. Under the plan, restaurants, which have been allowed to do takeout and deliveries, will be able to resume dine-in service. But restaurants will be limited to 25% capacity inside, with 10 feet between tables and only household members allowed at a table, Crum said. Limits also will be placed on outdoor seating. Crum said the state will continue to encourage takeout options.
Arizona
Glendale: Republican leaders of the Legislature who have been hoping to return to finish a coronavirus-interrupted session are instead planning to adjourn May 1 and come back at Gov. Doug Duceys call when state finances are more certain. Republican Rep. T.J. Shope said the agreement was hashed out between Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers late Tuesday morning. Adjourning the session that was put on hold after lawmakers passed a bare-bones budget March 23 would kill hundreds of pieces of legislation that had been making their way through the chambers. But Fann said senators of both parties were OK with that. Theyre sad that their bills are dead at this point, Fann said. But theyve all been pretty forward in just saying our goal here is weve got to get the state back up and going again. But it would also allow members to campaign and freely raise funds, including from lobbyists. 
Arkansas
Little Rock: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to ban most surgical abortions during the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dissolved a judges temporary restraining order that allowed surgical abortions to continue after the Arkansas Department of Health told the states only surgical abortion clinic to stop performing the procedure unless it was needed to protect the life or health of the mother. The appeals courts ruling said the Health Departments directive is a legally valid response to the circumstances confronted by the Governor and state health official. The state said Little Rock Family Planning Services violated an order requiring health providers to reschedule elective procedures that could be safely postponed.

Santa Clara County Public Health Department Director Dr. Sara Cody speaks during a news conference in San Jose, Calif. Two people with the coronavirus died in California as many as three weeks before the U.S. reported its first death from the disease in late February. Cody said the deaths were missed because of a scarcity of testing and the federal governments limited guidance on who should be tested.

San Francisco: Two people with the coronavirus died as much as three weeks before the U.S. reported its first death from the disease in late February a gap that a top health official said Wednesday may have led to delays in imposing stay-at-home restrictions in the nations most populous state. Dr. Sara Cody, health director in Northern Californias Santa Clara County, said the deaths were missed because of a scarcity of testing and the federal governments limited guidance on who should be tested. The infections in the two patients, who hadnt traveled out of the country to a coronavirus outbreak area, were confirmed by way of autopsy tissue samples that were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. The county coroners office received the results Tuesday, officials said. If we had had widespread testing earlier, and we were able to document the level of transmission in the county, if we had understood then people were already dying, yes, we probably would have acted earlier than we did, which would have meant more time at home, Cody said.
Colorado
Edwards: A customer at a grocery store was cited on suspicion of intentionally coughing on another shoppers items after refusing to comply with social distancing rules, authorities said. Nathan Herries, 51, of Vail refused to follow a request by an employee at the Village Market in Edwards to stay 6 feet away from customers and employees as required by the store and a county health order, the Eagle County Sheriffs Office said Monday. He ranted that the worker was falling for media hype about the coronavirus before getting between a customer and an employee and coughing on the products the other customer was buying, the office said. Herries was issued a summons for violating a public health order, disorderly conduct and tampering. He was not arrested. Herries said he believes the virus is similar to the common cold and is part of a plandemic by global central bankers to collapse the United States currency and bring about one world government. 
Connecticut
Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that plans are underway to greatly ramp up COVID-19 testing as officials consider how and when to safely reopen the state while avoiding a second wave of the disease. The Democrat announced a new partnership between Hartford HealthCare and Quest Diagnostics, which will allow the health network to boost its testing capacity from about 500 tests per day to 2,000, with results available in 24 hours. In recent weeks, there have been an average of 2,600 tests a day conducted across the entire state. Right now, we are only able to test people who are showing symptoms, so were missing an awful lot of the folks out there, Lamont said, noting that about 40% of people whove been infected by the coronavirus dont show symptoms right away. Its important that we be able to capture that if were ever able to get back to work safely.
Delaware
Wilmington: The state paid more than $30 million in unemployment benefits last week. The figure is typically $1.5 million a week. Delawares labor secretary said the state is receiving a historic number of unemployment claims in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Labor Secretary Cerron Cade said 61,842 unemployment claims have been filed since March 15. He said that number is close to the number of claims filed in the past two years combined. Cade said about 20% percent of the claims are from people who are not eligible for unemployment. He said about 65% of total applicants have been approved. Cade said the department hopes to have a program for self-employed and independent contract workers. Those types of workers previously did not receive unemployment from the state.

Washington: Nurses on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic protested outside the White House on Tuesday morning to bring attention to the lack of personal protective equipment for health care workers taking care of patients who may be infected with COVID-19, WUSA-TV reports. Members of National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses in the country, practiced social distancing at Lafayette Park and read aloud the names of U.S. nurses who died of COVID-19 because of the lack of PPE. With no federal health and safety standard, nurses and other health care workers in many hospitals across the country have not been provided with adequate PPE to protect them from exposure to the virus, NNU said on its website. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates at least 9,200 health care workers have gotten sick, and at least 27 have died.
Florida
Fort Lauderdale: Beaches in Flagler County on the states eastern coast reopened for limited recreation Wednesday, and those in Sarasota on the western coast will follow suit next week as municipalities throughout the Sunshine State start allowing residents to swim, fish, walk and jog on the sand. However, distancing guidelines including staying 6 feet apart remain in effect. Most communities are keeping beach opening times to a few hours in mornings and evenings and are barring any lounging on chairs and towels with coolers. Officials want to prevent social gatherings with shared food and drink that could spread COVID-19, while promoting healthful recreation. Unless youve been living in a cave, you know what to do to protect yourself, Sarasota County Commissioner Michael Moran said. Now that everyone is educated on (health guidelines), now its time to open up our lives.
Georgia
Atlanta: Gov. Brian Kemps call to reopen shuttered businesses has left many business owners wary and confused as they consider how to protect themselves and their customers in a state where coronavirus deaths exceed 800 and confirmed infections have surpassed 20,000. Kemps plan to kick-start the economy is one of the most aggressive announced since President Donald Trump laid out benchmarks for states to start lifting restrictions. But Georgias testing system has lagged much of the nation, and public health experts warned that moving too quickly could fuel a resurgence in infections. Its concerning. Im certainly not going to go to the gym or get a haircut, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University in Atlanta. Ill let people make their own decisions. Kemps order lets gyms, hair and nail salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors open with restrictions Friday. Restaurants can resume dine-in service Monday, though bars and nightclubs must remain closed.
Hawaii
Honolulu: A liquor control commission has launched an investigation of a brewery for giving away hand sanitizer with purchases of its beer. Maui Brewing Co. is under investigation by the Maui County Liquor Control Commission for distributing the sanitizer during the COVID-19 outbreak. The state Department of Liquor Control prohibits distributing goods in connection with alcohol sales. Its considered an inducement giving away something to entice people to buy alcohol. We were giving away sanitizer with any purchase, Maui Brewing CEO Garrett Marrero said. Of course were trying to encourage some business, but is it wrong? Im hearing stories that people are paying $10, $20 for an 8-ounce bottle, Marrero said. We were doing the right thing. Thats what is really disheartening. The investigation is in extremely poor taste given the situation surrounding the coronavirus, he said.
Idaho
Meridian: An anti-vaccine activist was arrested after she repeatedly refused orders by police to leave a playground that had been closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Sara Brady, who is affiliated with two groups that sponsored a protest at the Statehouse last week against Gov. Brad Littles stay-at-home order, was at the playground with several other families as part of what some dubbed a playdate protest. Video posted by another person shows officers repeatedly asking Brady to leave, telling her the play structures had been closed under an order from the mayor. They said Brady and the rest of the group were welcome to continue playing on grassy areas. Brady, there with her children, repeatedly refused. Arrest me for being in the park. Do it, she told the officer, telling another protester to continue recording as she was handcuffed. Brady, 40, was booked and charged with a misdemeanor but posted $300 bond a short time later. She and others gathered later in front of City Hall to protest.

Chicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday said the state wouldnt hit its highest level of COVID-19 cases until mid-May, weeks after originally projected, throwing into question whether the Democrat will extend his stay-at-home order past April 30. Pritzker wouldnt discuss the data hes using in adjusting the projected peak date, which had been predicted for the latter part of this month. But he said people are abiding by social-distancing rules, slowing the spread of the coronavirus. We will be making some changes to the stay-at-home order as it is, but it is true that it is working, so to remove it entirely is to simply open everything back up to infection, Pritzker said. The Democrats stay-at-home directive is a month old. Last Friday, Pritzker announced that schools, empty since March 17, would continue with remote learning through the semester.
Indiana
Indianapolis: State officials refused Tuesday to identify nursing homes where coronavirus outbreaks have occurred, even as they disclosed that at least 43 more deaths linked to those facilities have happened in the past week. The 162 deaths from 74 facilities that the state health commissioner said had occurred represent nearly 26% of Indianas 630 COVID-19 fatalities recorded through Monday. Almost 70% of Indianas deaths have been among people ages 70 and older, as elderly people and those with serious health troubles living in nursing homes are among the most at-risk from COVID-19 infections. Officials had earlier this month identified some nursing homes with multiple deaths, including an Anderson facility where at least 22 patients have died. But the health commissioner, Dr. Kristina Box, has declined in recent days to provide more than statewide totals of infections and deaths. Thats where were going to leave that at this point, Box said.
Iowa
Iowa City: The state launched a $26 million program Tuesday to increase its lagging capacity to test for the coronavirus as the number of residents known to be infected continued to skyrocket. Gov. Kim Reynolds led a social media campaign urging everyone to voluntarily complete a health assessment at TestIowa.com. Those who have symptoms, have been exposed to the coronavirus or have traveled to hot spots will soon be eligible for free drive-thru tests. Those who are positive will be asked to share recent contacts and travel so the state can alert those potentially exposed. The state signed a $26 million contract to purchase 540,000 tests over the next six months from Nomi Health, a Utah-based startup. The governors office said the cost, $48 per test, is in line with commercial rates and would be paid for with federal funds.
Kansas
Mission: Inspections are underway at a Kansas City, Kansas, rehabilitation facility where 25 people have died of COVID-19 and another 91 have contracted the disease. The outbreak at the Riverbend Post Acute Rehabilitation started after a staff member who wasnt wearing appropriate personal protective equipment worked two shifts last month with a fever and cough before being diagnosed with COVID-19, according to a report that local health officials released last week. State and federal inspectors are now looking into infection control measures that are being implemented at the facility, said Cara Sloan, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. The deaths at Riverbend, which provides short-term rehabilitation for people recovering from medical issues as well as long-term care, account for nearly a quarter of Kansas 107 deaths from COVID-19.
Kentucky

Frankfort: The state should resist the temptation of being the fastest to reopen its coronavirus-battered economy, instead focusing on being the smartest and the best to prevent any follow-up spikes in infections, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. The governor offered those cautionary words as he reported 17 more virus-related deaths in Kentucky, raising the statewide death count to 171 since the pandemic began. Total virus cases approached 3,200 statewide as the governor announced nearly 180 new cases. Beshear and other governors are at the center of a turbulent debate about how quickly to reopen businesses and ease guidelines meant to control the virus. Last week, protesters calling for businesses to reopen could be heard as Beshear gave his daily briefing at the statehouse. On Tuesday, the Democratic governor urged Kentucky residents to be strong and resilient in following guidelines meant to curb the viruss spread. Easing restrictions too soon would risk secondary spikes in cases, inflicting another round of damage on the economy, Beshear said.
Louisiana
New Orleans: A hospital celebrated the discharge of its 1,500th coronavirus patient amid cheers from doctors and nurses more than a month after getting its first virus patient. A video on the Ochsner Medical Center Facebook page showed Kathleen Bennett, 57, as she was reunited with her granddaughter Monday while a musician who followed behind her played When the Saints Go Marching In. Bennett was admitted to the medical center March 27. After her arrival, she was placed in the intensive care unit and put on a ventilator for 12 days, the hospital said in a news release. Doctors will continue caring for Bennett after she heads to Kansas to continue quarantining with the rest of her family. As of Tuesday, Louisianas health department reported there had been nearly 25,000 coronavirus cases in the state, and 1,405 people have died from the virus. 
Maine
Portland: The state received less than a third fewer protective respirator masks per resident from the national stockpile than Vermont or Rhode Island but more than three times that of Texas, a newspaper reports. The Portland Press Herald analysis shows that the N95 masks, which filter out 95% of all airborne particles, including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks, werent allocated based on population, as the Trump administration had indicated. As of April 6, Maine had received 86,008 N95s from the stockpile, or 1 for every 15.6 state inhabitants. Vermont received 1 for every 4.7 of its citizens, while Rhode Island got 1 for every 5. Hard-hit Massachusetts got fewer 1 for every 28 people and Texas received 1 for every 48. Whatever methodology this administration is using, theres no transparency or accountability to it, said Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat. Partisan politics didnt appear to have played a factor in which states got larger shipments, the newspaper reports. 
Maryland
Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University said it will halt contributions to employees retirement plans and cut salaries in its leadership. The school in Baltimore also said some employees are expected to be furloughed or laid off. The Baltimore Sun reports university President Ronald Daniels announced the changes in a letter posted online Tuesday. He said the university is projected to suffer significant revenue losses after a dramatic and unprecedented contraction because of the coronavirus. Daniels said he and Provost Sunil Kumar will cut their salaries by 20% in fiscal year 2021. Other deans and university officers will cut their pay by 10%. Contributions to employees retirement plans will stop for one year in fiscal year 2021. There will also be a freeze on employees salaries through June 2021.
Massachusetts
Boston: The state has paused a program to test residents of nursing homes and long-term health care centers for the coronavirus after problems with the collection of samples, Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said. The elderly are particularly susceptible, and more than half the states fatalities from the virus were nursing home residents, according to figures from the state Department of Public Health. The state announced this month that nursing homes could order test kits to be delivered and then administered by trained personnel. But after sending out 14,000 tests, only 4,000 were returned, and many were unlabeled or in leaking tubes, Sudders told The Boston Globe on Tuesday. The state will continue to offer mobile testing at nursing homes through the National Guard while officials work to solve the problems with the test kit program.

Lansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Tuesday that President Donald Trumps plan to suspend immigration is distracting from efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic and part of inconsistent messages that spread fear and put the public in greater danger. Trumps pronouncements about freezing immigration are scary for immigrants, family members hoping to immigrate to the U.S., farmers who rely on seasonal migrant workers and Canadian nurses who work in Michigan, the Democratic governor said in an interview with the Associated Press. These broad statements that come out I think are are so problematic and counter to, I think, what we need right now more than anything which is fact-based, scientifically proven best practices and an optimistic vision of where we are headed and the thrust to make it a reality, said Whitmer, who said the focus should be on making swabs for testing.
Minnesota
Minneapolis: COVID-19 has killed 19 more Minnesotans, marking the largest one-day death toll since the pandemic reached the state, the Minnesota Department of Health reported Wednesday. The new deaths raised the states total to 179. The department also reported 154 new confirmed cases, a big one-day jump that raised the states total to 2,721. Health officials have cautioned that the real number of Minnesotans infected with the coronavirus is likely much higher because most people dont qualify for testing. The department also said 240 Minnesotans were hospitalized with the disease as of Wednesday, up three from Tuesday, while 107 were in intensive care, down 10 from Tuesday. Another 1,317 patients have recovered and no longer need isolation.
Mississippi
Jackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that the state economy will reopen gradually after health officials and others say its safe to do so during the coronavirus pandemic. He cautioned that life will not immediately return to normal. A day after other Republican governors in parts of the South announced plans to start reopening some businesses in coming days, Reeves said he is still considering how to ease into more changes in Mississippi. This is not going to be a light switch that we can turn on, Reeves said. His statewide stay-at-home order began the evening of April 3 and remains in effect until Monday, after he extended it by one week. The governors first step toward reopening some businesses started this week, with those deemed nonessential, such as florists and clothing stores, allowed to sell items by delivery or curbside pickup. 
Missouri
OFallon: Two rural counties are seeing huge spikes in coronavirus cases, including many connected to meatpacking plants. Saline County on Wednesday reported 96 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Moniteau County reported 55 cases, citing 29 as confirmed and 26 as probable. Neither county has reported a death. Statewide, the number of confirmed cases topped 6,000 on Wednesday. Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for Systems Science and Engineering, which is monitoring cases worldwide, shows 6,210 cases in Missouri, up 247 from Tuesday. The number of deaths rose by 14 to 229. While the vast majority of Missouri cases have been in the largest cities and their suburbs, data provided by Saline and Moniteau counties showed they have the highest per capita rates of infection in the state 419 cases per 100,000 residents in Saline County and 341 per 100,000 in Moniteau County.
Montana
Helena: Gov. Steve Bullock issued directives Tuesday to allow an increase in the number of medical providers in the state during the COVID-19 emergency and to expand insurance coverage for telehealth visits for routine medical care. One directive makes it easier for retired health care professionals and licensed out-of-state providers to practice. The other requires health insurers to provide the same coverage for telehealth services as they do for in-person routine care visits to allow for continued social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The directives are in effect until the end of Montanas state of emergency. Bullock has said he plans to lift some of the restrictions that were put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus starting this weekend, but he has not yet said what will change.
Nebraska

Omaha: An outlet mall that announced plans to reopen this week amid the coronavirus pandemic appeared to back away from those plans Tuesday with an online post that said the opening was primarily for employees to get their stores ready for business. Officials with Nebraska Crossing, an upscale outlet mall near Omaha, said the only venue that would be open for in-person customers was a medical uniform store. The rest of the mall would remain closed to the public, Nebraska Crossing said Tuesday on its Facebook page. The outlets owner, Rod Yates, had previously outlined plans for a soft opening Friday and described it as a case study of best practices for other malls. He later added that it was up to individual stores whether they chose to reopen. Nebraska is one of a handful of states without an official stay-home order in place. The state has seen a sharp increase in known cases over the past few days.
Nevada
Carson City: Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Tuesday that hes extending the closure of schools until the end of the school year and is not close to relaxing restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. The Democratic governor and state experts said Tuesday that Nevada would take a gradual approach to easing business closures and stay-at-home rules, without giving any expected date for how soon that might occur. Sisolak also said it was too soon to say whether schools would remain closed for the start of the new school year in the fall. Nevada has had fewer cases and deaths than statistical models originally predicted, and they appear to be reaching a plateau. But the state still needs to see at least a two-week trend of drops in the number of hospitalizations and people testing positive before the state could start to inch open some restrictions. Even though the models look good for Nevada right now, we are not out of the woods yet, Sisolak said.
New Hampshire
Manchester: Southern New Hampshire University is responding to the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn by accelerating new education models that combine online classes with on-campus living. The private college is launching a new program for the 2020-21 academic year in which students would take courses online while living on campus and participating in campus clubs, athletics and other activities. Students would still pay room and board, but tuition would be $10,000 per year, 60% lower than the current rate. And for the first year, the college is offering a one-time scholarship to all incoming freshmen covering the tuition costs. We knew that a traditional college education was increasingly out of reach for a majority of Americans before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, SNHU President Paul LeBlanc said. Students need access to high-quality, affordable degree pathways that are workforce relevant and wont saddle them with years of debt upon graduation.
New Jersey
Trenton: Two testing facilities that the state operates with the federal government are now taking residents who show no coronavirus symptoms. The Monmouth County Prosecutors Office said Wednesday that the centers in Monmouth and Bergen counties will no longer require state residents to have symptoms in order to get tested. The state operates the drive-thru facilities with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. One is at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, Monmouth County. The other is at Bergen Community College in Paramus. Beyond the two federally affiliated facilities, New Jersey has about 70 other testing centers across the state and conducts about 9,000 tests a day, according to Gov. Phil Murphy. He said Tuesday that he thinks the state needs to double the number of tests it does daily.
New Mexico
Albuquerque: University of New Mexico scientists and clinical staff have started to sterilize and reuse single-use personal protective equipment in an effort to salvage dwindling supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, KOAT-TV reports. Personal protective equipment is running in short supply as an increasing number of people contract COVID-19, threatening employees at medical facilities around the world, officials said. Health care providers have used a method involving vaporized hydrogen peroxide to sterilize and reuse protective gear for the past three weeks, an idea that came from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, professor of medicine D.J. Perkins said. The process can take up to four hours, but 1,000 masks can be sterilized at a time, officials said.

Albany: Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg will help create a tracing army that will help find people infected with the coronavirus and get them into isolation, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. New York will work on the massive effort with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut. Wide-scale testing, tracing and isolation are considered crucial to taming the outbreak in the hard-hit New York City region. It all has to be coordinated. There is no tracing that can work with one jurisdiction, Cuomo said at his daily briefing. The governor said that we will literally need thousands of people to trace the contacts of infected people. The state currently has just 225 tracers with almost 500 more in New York City and its suburbs, and their efforts to contain the virus by finding people who had contact with the sick fell apart. Cuomo said officials will start to build a greater force of disease detectives by drawing from 35,000 medical field students at state and city universities.
North Carolina
Raleigh: All couples in the state should again be able to marry before a local magistrate after worries about the spread of COVID-19 had led several counties to halt such officiating. Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley ordered this week that all counties resume performing marriage ceremonies but gave local court officials flexibility in how and where to do them. Some officiating became more difficult in recent weeks as churches and other venues closed, the state judicial system said in a release. Couples came in with large numbers of witnesses that made social distancing difficult. So some courts stopped performing marriages altogether. Beasley said its important the ceremonies continue because marriage forms an important part of the family structure and establishes a number of rights and legal obligations.

Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Tuesday that the state plans to increase widespread testing and contact tracing for the coronavirus in order to help protect vulnerable residents and meet White House guidelines to put people back to work. The announcement came after health officials reported 240 new tests for COVID-19, which Burum called a disappointing low number due to an expected lag in reporting and the fact that there were no targeted screening efforts as in previous days. The state reported more than 1,100 tests Monday, capping off a wide-ranging effort that included 424 examinations of people associated with an outbreak at a Grand Forks wind turbine plant. The states ability to meet the White House goal of a May 1 grand opening will depend on a team testing effort, Burgum said. While hes confident the state will make great strides toward that objective, Burgum said he cant predict human behavior.
Ohio
Columbus: A federal judge gave state officials an early victory in a lawsuit challenging the shuttering of nonessential employers in response to the pandemic. The judge rejected a Columbus bridal shops bid for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed it to reopen. While another hearing on the lawsuit is set for May 11, U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley said in his decision Monday that state officials have legitimate reasons for setting the restrictions on businesses. The bridal shop and its attorneys argue the state should give businesses a way to appeal individual closings. But Marbley said that isnt practical. Meanwhile, Urbana University will be permanently closing its campus, making it the first Ohio college to fold as a result of financial pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to close the small, liberal arts campus near Columbus will affect 350 students and more than 100 full-time faculty, according to a statement from Franklin University, which acquired Urbana as a branch campus in 2014.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City: The number of coronavirus cases is now near 2,900 in the state, with 170 deaths due to COVID-19, which is caused by the virus, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Wednesday. There are at least 2,894 cases and six additional deaths, up from 2,807 reported Tuesday and an increase of six deaths. Each death was a person age 65 or older, according to the report, which said 298 people either with the virus or under investigation were hospitalized Tuesday morning. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. Tulsa County reports the most deaths with 25, followed by Oklahoma and Cleveland counties with 24 deaths each.
Oregon
Salem: The White House told governors their leadership is critical in testing for the coronavirus, providing a map showing that Oregon is among four states with the lowest testing capacity in the United States. Oregon, Montana, Oklahoma and Maine are able to test fewer than 30 in 1,000 people a month, according to an email sent Monday by the White House coronavirus task force. Rapid and efficient testing is needed to identify where the virus is emerging and allow authorities to track people who may have been exposed, according to the email, which Democratic Gov. Kate Browns office released after a public records request by The Oregonian/OregonLive. The White House email demonstrates clearly what we have been telling them for weeks: We need additional testing capacity, and we are dependent on the federal government to provide us with the testing materials we need, said Charles Boyle, Browns spokesman.
Pennsylvania
Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolfs administration is boosting its efforts to get voters to cast their primary election ballots by mail, saying it would help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The administration sent 4.2 million postcards to primary voters and is mounting an awareness campaign on radio, television, social media, streaming services, mobile apps and email, officials said Wednesday. Wolfs administration has resisted calls from several heavily populated counties to mail a June 2 primary ballot to every registered voter and move to an all-mail, or nearly all-mail, election. But the states efforts to get voters to apply for a mail-in ballot or absentee ballot have gotten traction. Republican and Democratic party officials in Pennsylvania have encouraged people to vote by mail amid concerns from county officials who fear the virus will make it difficult to find polling places and get poll workers to staff them.

Pawtucket: Two cities hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic are getting additional testing capacity. A testing site is scheduled to open Thursday at the now-closed Memorial Hospital property in Pawtucket, according to a statement from the cities of Pawtucket and Central Falls. The site will be operated by Care New England. Services at the site will be provided in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Creole and other languages. There have been 540 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pawtucket, the second-highest total in the state, according to figures released Wednesday by the state Department of Health. There have been more than 200 cases in Central Falls. The cities have created CFP Beat Covid-19, a partnership committed to reaching out to every household in the communities so every resident knows what to do and who to call when they feel sick.
South Carolina
Columbia: The state has officially taken its public schools virtual for the remainder of the school year, extending a distance-learning environment implemented more than a month ago as the new coronavirus outbreak emerged in South Carolina. As expected, Gov. Henry McMaster announced Wednesday that all public K-12 schools will remain closed through the rest of the spring semester. He said a forthcoming executive order would provide flexibility to school districts, particularly for summertime instructional possibilities for special needs students. We have been able to carry on really good instruction, state Education Superintendent Molly Spearman said during a briefing, even as she acknowledged that 1 in 4 districts have been unable to teach online, relying instead on worksheets and other paper materials. The digital divide in South Carolina has become very apparent, Spearman said.
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: A pair of speedways are forging ahead with plans to hold two auto races expected to draw hundreds of fans this weekend, even as the governor warns against attending them. Gov. Kristi Noem said she wont be taking any action to shut down the events planned for Saturday and Sunday nights even though she thinks they are a bad idea and could lead to the spread of the coronavirus. The two race tracks, just over the border from Iowa, decided to sell limited tickets to give race fans a taste of normalcy after weeks of social distancing and canceled sporting events. The Republican governor said the crowds at the races would violate her guidance not to gather in groups of more than 10, but she has not said why she wont stop the races from proceeding. Health experts have said eliminating group gatherings is crucial to curbing the spread of the coronavirus, which can be transmitted by people who do not exhibit symptoms.
Tennessee
Chattanooga: Two brothers who stockpiled thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and other highly sought after safety supplies during the coronavirus outbreak will not be fined, state officials announced Tuesday after reaching a settlement. Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III launched an investigation March 14 into price-gouging allegations against brothers Matthew and Noah Colvin, who were featured in a story by The New York Times after they took a 1,300-mile journey through Tennessee and Kentucky to purchase hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes and face masks to sell online. Matt Colvin told the newspaper he posted 300 bottles of hand sanitizer for sale on Amazon for between $8 and $70 each and immediately sold them all. It was crazy money, he told the newspaper. As part of the states settlement, the brothers will no longer be allowed to sell emergency or medical supplies at an excess price during the pandemic, Slatery said. 
Texas
Austin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday renewed his defense of coronavirus monitoring in the Lone Star State, which throughout the crisis has ranked near the bottom in the U.S. in testing, as he accelerates toward relaxing social restrictions before the end of April. Next Monday, Abbott is planning to issue new statewide orders that will further loosen Texas lockdown beyond the reopening of state parks and letting retailers sell items curbside, which take effect this week. Saying hospitals arent overwhelmed and pointing to a decline in fatalities in recent days, Abbott said the numbers are trending well as Texas marches toward reopening. But Texas has also lagged nationally when it comes to testing and ranks near the bottom per capita, according to an analysis by the Associated Press of data collected by the COVID Tracking Project.
Utah
Salt Lake City: The state will buy 200,000 treatments of malaria drugs widely touted by President Donald Trump for treating the new coronavirus despite warnings from doctors that the medications shouldnt be used until more testing is done, state officials said Tuesday. The government will purchase the treatments that include hydroxychloroquine from a Utah-based compounding pharmacy called Meds in Motion, said Tom Hudachko, Utah Department of Health spokesman. The company, which has been promoting use of the drugs along with several Republican state lawmakers since mid-March, was selected under emergency procurement rules that negate the usual bid process. The amount that Meds in Motion will be paid hasnt been finalized because the contract is not done, Hudachko said, but he estimates the cost will be in the millions and said about three-fourths of the cost would be covered by federal funds.

Montpelier: About a dozen people showed up on the Statehouse lawn on a snowy Wednesday to protest against Gov. Phil Scotts stay-at-home order. At the same time, four nurses from Central Vermont Medical Center wearing face masks turned out to speak against the demonstration. The protesters had planned to parade through the capital in their vehicles at 11 a.m. The Montpelier police chief had warned about possible traffic delays, but only a handful of protesters came. We have essentially crushed our economy, and we need to be able to open back up and get back to work as fast as we can, said protester Sarah Toscano, of Hinesburg, who was wearing a face mask but said the governor seems to be dragging his feet. Scott said he was also frustrated by the restrictions required to confront the pandemic and is also eager to reopen the states economy, but he would listen to the science and make decisions on what he feels is in the best interest of the health of Vermonters.

Richmond: The coronavirus pandemic upended a legislative session, as mask-wearing lawmakers met Wednesday under a giant tent outside the Capitol and car horns blared nearby from protesters unhappy with mandated business closings. House Delegates met under a canopy outside, while the Senate met at a giant event space at the Science Museum of Virginia a couple of miles away. Lawmakers were seated far apart and wearing masks instead of germ-carrying ties to help prevent the spread of the virus. Proceedings in the House quickly stalled for about 40 minutes when members encountered technical issues voting during an attendance roll call. One state senator with health issues was surrounded by plexiglass for added protection. Before the Legislature convened, protesters on foot and in vehicles converged outside the Capitol, leaning on their horns and shouting in the direction of the Capitol and governors mansion.
Washington
Seattle: Hundreds of inmates have moved out of state prisons as the new coronavirus continues to spread in facilities across Washington, and hundreds more are on lists for possible release, officials said Wednesday. At least 21 Department of Corrections employees and 13 offenders have tested positive for COVID-19, with most cases occurring at the Monroe Corrections Complex. That prison has seven workers and 13 offenders with the disease. Monroe inmates filed an emergency motion asking the Washington Supreme Court to force Gov. Jan Inslee and Secretary Stephen Sinclair to release inmates who were most vulnerable to the deadly disease. An initial order required the state to take steps to protect the health of the incarcerated population. The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the case Thursday. For the first time, the hearing will be conducted using remote technology.
West Virginia
Charleston: An infant has tested positive for the coronavirus as the states caseload continues to grow, officials said Wednesday. At least 939 people have the virus after nearly 26,000 tests, state health officials said. Twenty-six people have died. Logan County Health Department Administrator Steve Browning said a 4-month-old girl who tested positive is being treated at home. Gov. Jim Justice has canceled schools for the rest of the year over concerns about the virus. The Republican governor, turning his attention to reopening the states economy, has pushed to ease virus restrictions on hospitals if they can prove they have enough protective equipment and could handle an unexpected surge in cases. The move came as he and his administration said the states testing capacity has been dramatically increased through a partnership with LabCorp, a major lab testing company.
Wisconsin
Madison: Nineteen people in the state have tested positive for the coronavirus after having voted in person in the April 7 election or after having worked at the polls, the state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. Also, five Wisconsin National Guard members who helped staff polls on election day have reported symptoms of COVID-19, but the one who was tested came back as negative, Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp said. The other four were not offered tests, he said. The state health department said it does not know if the 19 positive cases contracted COVID-19 at the polls or elsewhere. Several reported possible other exposures, the health department said. Health officials had said ahead of the April 7 election they were concerned about a spike in coronavirus cases due to in-person voting. Those concerns were heightened after voters had to wait in line for hours in close proximity at polling sites in Milwaukee and Green Bay.
Wyoming
Casper: The City Council has decided for a second time not to punish people who violate state health orders intended to limit spread of the coronavirus. The Casper City Council rejected the proposal Tuesday after a similar vote last week. One concern is where to jail violators. Sheriff Gus Holbrook has asked officers to avoid bringing people suspected of coronavirus exposure to jail to avoid spreading the virus within the jail, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. City staff will instead look for a way to house people suspected of violating health orders. The state orders in place through April 30 have closed down bars and other businesses while prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people at a time. At least six people in Wyoming had died of the coronavirus as of Wednesday.

6,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",MORGAN LEE AND NICKY FORSTER / AP,U.S. Counties Without Coronavirus Are Mostly Rural and Poor,More than a third of U.S. counties have yet to report a single positive test result for COVID-19 infections.,https://time.com/5812186/counties-coronavirus-rural-poor/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AP20084718909880.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,2020-03-29T15:41:49Z,"SANTA FE, N.M. — As the coronavirus rages across the United States, mainly in large urban areas, more than a third of U.S. counties have yet to report a single positive test result for COVID-19 infections, an analysis by The Associated Press shows.
Data compiled by John Hopkins University shows that 1,297 counties have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 out of 3,142 counties nationwide. Of the counties without positive tests, 85% are in rural areas — from predominantly white communities in Appalachia and the Great Plains to majority Hispanic and Native American stretches of the American Southwest — that generally have less everyday contact between people that can help transmit the virus.
At the same time, counties with zero positive tests for COVID-19 have a higher median age and higher proportion of people older than 60 — the most vulnerable to severe effects of the virus — and far fewer intensive care beds should they fall sick. Median household income is lower too, potentially limiting health care options.
The demographics of these counties hold major implications as the Trump administration develops guidelines to rate counties by risk of the virus spreading, empowering local officials to revise social distancing orders that have sent much of the U.S. economy into freefall. President Donald Trump has targeted a return to a semblance of normalcy for the economy by Easter Sunday, April 12.
Experts in infectious disease see an opportunity in slowing the spread of coronavirus in remote areas of the country that benefit from “natural” social distancing and isolation, if initial cases are detected and quarantined aggressively. That can buy rural health care networks time to provide robust care and reduce mortality.
But they also worry that sporadic testing for coronavirus could be masking outbreaks that — left unattended — might overwhelm rural health networks.
“They’ll be later to get the infection, they’ll be later to have their epidemics,” said Christine K. Johnson, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Davis. “But I don’t think they’re going to be protected because there’s nowhere in the U.S. that’s isolated.”
Counties that have zero confirmed COVID-19 cases could raise a red flag about inadequate testing, she said.
“I hope the zeros are really zeros — I worry that they’re not doing enough testing in those regions because they’re not thinking they’re at risk,” she said.
In New Mexico, a state with 2 million residents spanning an area the size of Italy, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has moved aggressively to contain the coronavirus’ spread with a statewide school shutdown and prohibition on most gatherings of over five people.
Nearly half of the state’s 33 counties are free of any positive coronavirus cases. New Mexico is among the top five states in coronavirus testing per capita, though some virus-free counties aren’t yet equipped with specialized testing sites beyond samplings by a handful of doctor offices.
Torrance County Manager Wayne Johnson said plans are being prepared for the first three dedicated COVID-19 testing sites, in the high-desert county of 15,000 residents that spans an area three times the size of Rhode Island.
A statewide stay-at-home order is keeping many residents from commuting to jobs in adjacent Bernalillo County, the epicenter of the state’s COVID-19 infections, with 93 confirmed cases out of a state government tally of 208 as of Saturday night.
“We don’t have any test sites open, and part of that is that we don’t have any needs for the test yet,” Johnson said. Still, Johnson said he worries that an outbreak could overwhelm the county’s sole local medical clinic and an all-volunteer corps of emergency medical technicians.
The state´s first of two coronavirus-related deaths occurred last Sunday within a southern oil-producing region in Eddy County, where two other positive tests have surfaced. A man in his late-70s died shortly after arriving at a hospital in Artesia, and tested positive postmortem. He had previously visited two health clinics, and at the hospital five staff were quarantined for possible exposure even though they wore face masks.
State Deputy Epidemiologist Chad Smelser said health officials have continued to painstakingly retrace the steps of infected patients and notify people who came into contact with them. There are dozens of connections per infection on average.
“We know the details of his prior visits in the health care system,” Smelser said of the deceased Eddy County patient. “We’ve worked with those physicians to assess their exposure. And we do not believe that he acquired it in the health care setting.”
State health officials say it is unclear how many people have been tested for coronavirus in each county.
Medical experts say uneven testing patterns across the country make it difficult to gauge whether remote areas are really better off.
“It’s a fundamental unknown,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&amp;M University in Texarkana. “I think there is some truth to that notion that there are lower infection rates out there” in rural areas.
He said he fears for homeless populations and undocumented migrants.
¨We hope they stay safe. Those would be hard places to get rid of the coronavirus,¨ Neuman said.
Complaints that testing is not readily available extend to the crossroads town of Crossett in southern Arkansas, where surrounding Ashley County has no confirmed coronavirus cases.
Disabled veteran Marty Zollman, 42, of Crossett says his wife, a clothing store clerk, and teenage daughter sought coronavirus testing this week for fever and flu-like symptoms at a local health clinic and were turned away.
“We might be contagious, but no one will test her,” Zollman said of his wife, Janet, who was awaiting surgery for breast cancer. “They keep turning her down. They don’t have a source of testing.”
He lashed out at Trump for indicating that testing is readily available. “Now it’s time for me to call his bluff. If he’s got the equipment … he’s got to provide it,” Zollman said.
In New Mexico, along the southernmost finger of the Rocky Mountains, Mora Valley Community Health Services and a companion agency attend to elderly patients living in extreme poverty in Mora County, where there have been no confirmed COVID-19 infections and few if any people tested.
With a population of 4,500 that is more than 80% Latino, the county is among the economically poorest in the nation. Average combined household income is $27,000.
“There’s elderly out there that have dementia, who don’t have a family … who eat out of cans,” said Julián Barela, CEO of Community Health Services, which ordinarily serves a steady stream of Medicaid and Medicare patients with health, dental and behavior health services.
Under new state directives, the clinic has scuttled all non-emergency appointments — most of its caseload — to comply with a measure designed to conserve dwindling protective gear such as masks, gloves and gowns for health care workers, Barela said. The clinic has yet to see a patient with telltale symptoms of coronavirus worth testing.
Barela said it has been alarming to turn away patients who feel they need attention as new federal grant money arrives.
“We don’t have an emergency backlog, it doesn’t seem reasonable that we’re just shut down,” he said. “We should not operate the same as New York. There is no reason for it.”

Teams can hold voluntary classroom instruction, workouts and non-football educational programs using online platforms, according to a memo sent to the teams that was obtained by The Associated Press.
League executive Troy Vincent said it’s imperative to be “reasonable and responsible in the current environment.”
The three-week, virtual offseason starts on April 20 for teams with new head coaches and April 27 for the others. It runs through May 15. Teams with a new head coach have the option to go four weeks.
A team can’t begin its virtual program after April 27. Teams also can’t save their virtual weeks for use after facilities open and players return to the field.
Participating players must be paid the $235 daily minimum and players with offseason workout bonuses must be credited for their participation in those sessions. Each rookie player will receive a minimum of $135 for each day he participates in a club’s development program.
Teams can provide workout equipment worth up to $1,500 per player.
The league’s offseason program concludes June 26. If stay-at-home orders throughout the country continue into the summer, teams will have to conduct a mandatory veteran minicamp in a virtual manner.
“Whatever we do is going to be in compliance with the governing rules of the particular state and it’s going to be consistent with good and recommended medical health practices,” NFL lead counsel Jeff Pash said. “We’re going to do it in a way that preserves competitive equity and doesn’t expose anyone to risks that the medical profession says people shouldn’t be exposed to. We’re going to rely on that kind of guidance.”
Pash said the league has not discussed contingency plans to alter the schedule, or play games outside a team’s home stadium.

While she loves animals, the 46-year-old professional speaker spends lots of time on the road, making it hard to justify keeping a furry friend at home.
But many of Bonney’s upcoming events have been cancelled or moved online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Bonney, a frequent flyer who’s used to being around lots of people, found herself stuck at home alone in Traverse City, Mich. When a friend who runs a rabbit rescue center reached out about a fostering opportunity, she leapt at the chance, and soon found herself taking care of Pepper, a “spunky little thing” that offers both companionship and a distraction from world events.
“I love animals and can’t normally have them,” says Bonney, who’s allergic to more traditional pets like cats and dogs. Taking care of Pepper gives Bonney something to look forward to between online meeting after online meeting. “When other options are limited, I can go in and sit with her. She has fun, I have fun,” she says. 
Lots of other Americans are also welcoming new animals into their homes for much-needed companionship while they self-isolate amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We have more people wanting to foster than we have pets,” says Ginnie Baumann Robilotta, vice-president of Animal Rescue New Orleans. The shelter, which is operating by appointment only, typically has about 50 dogs; it currently has only 16. From March 11 to April 5, 42 dogs and 14 cats were adopted from the shelter, compared to 27 dogs and six cats during the same period last year. “In spite of the uncertainty of what’s going to happen, the love of an animal is going to change people’s lives,” says Robilotta.
Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.
All told, animal rescue organizations across the country are seeing about a 90% increase in foster requests, says Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. “It’s sort of the perfect storm of factors that have allowed people to foster at this time,” says Block. “People are home, working remotely, feeling socially isolated. This is not a usual thing for us. Having that dog or cat or hamster does make a big difference.”
The fostering boom is helping shelters and rescues, too. Like many other businesses and organizations, they are struggling with the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. As donations dry up and workers or volunteers stay home, having fewer animals on hand helps shelters focus on the remaining critters — and new ones that arrive as some people abandon their pets for financial reasons.
Is there any danger that people will give up their new pets once some semblance of normality returns? Block doesn’t think so — shelter staffers typically make sure people understand the responsibility they’re taking on. “There’s an investment made,” she says. “When people go to shelters, they’re having thoughtful, smart conversations about what it means to bring an animal into your home.”
Taking in a foster dog has given Aditi Srivastav a newfound sense of purpose amid the pandemic. After she started working remotely in March, Srivastav, 30, was struggling with the stress of self-isolation. Her husband, a geriatric nurse practitioner, is working long hours and putting himself in danger of contracting COVID-19. But during a late March home visit with a patient in rural South Carolina, Srivastav’s husband found an injured, abandoned dog, and took him home.
At first, Srivastav struggled with the emotional weight of tending to a hurt animal. “Feeling the helplessness that I’m not a vet, I cried,” she says. But her sense of burden quickly turned around. “I also realized it was the first time in two weeks of this self-quarantine that I felt some sort of contentment that I’m doing something that’s helping,” she says.
Now Srivastav and the pup — named Battle after a veterinarian who saved his life — are attached to one another. She misses her friends, but being around Battle has provided some much-needed joy. “Getting that gratification, that immediate response of ‘wow, I did something,’ is hard because so many things have moved online,” she says. “But you feel more content that maybe something good is coming out of spending time at home.” 
The company of an animal in need can be particularly soothing for people stuck home alone. Barry Stewart, a professor at Mississippi State University, is currently living apart from his wife, an emergency room doctor. She usually travels between Starkville, Miss. and Memphis, Tenn. for work, but she’s been staying in Memphis to avoid bringing the virus back home. She also took the couple’s dog, Bradley, with her for company, leaving Stewart on his own. After the local humane society put out a notice seeking foster parents, Stewart, 57, came home with a lab-pit bull mix he’s been calling Alexa. He’s not sure if he’ll keep her forever — that’s for Bradley to decide when he gets home, Stewart says — but he appreciates her company for now.
“It’s been great to have her during this time,” Stewart says. “She gets me outside. We walk around the neighborhood, look at things. Otherwise I’d be alone.”

Health Minister Hugo Monroy’s comments were dramatically out of line with what the government had previously said about infected deportees. Later, presidential spokesman Carlos Sandoval told reporters that Monroy was referring to a March flight on which “between 50% and 75% (of the passengers) during all their time in isolation and quarantine have come back positive.”
Before Tuesday, Guatemala had only reported three positive infections among deportees flown back by the United States.
Joaquín Samayoa, spokesman for the foreign affairs ministry, confirmed a fourth positive case for a migrant who arrived on a flight Monday. At least three of the migrants who arrived Monday were taken directly to a hospital for COVID-19 testing.
President Alejandro Giammattei addressed the nation later, but made no mention of the deportees. It remained unclear why before Tuesday the government had only reported three deportees who tested positive and how many more would have been among the high percentage who tested positive aboard that March flight. Giammattei said Tuesday there were a total of 175 people who had tested positive in Guatemala and five who had died.
“There are really flights where the deportees arrive … citizens who come with fever, and they get on the planes that way,” Monroy said. “We automatically evaluate them here and test them and many of them have come back positive.”
He added that the United States had practically become the Wuhan of the region, referring to the Chinese province where the pandemic began.
Guatemala again began receiving deportation flights from the United States Monday after a one-week pause prompted by three deportees testing positive for COVID-19.
The Guatemalan government had asked the United States to not send more than 25 deportees per flight, to give them health exams before departure and to certify that they were not infected.
However, the flights resumed Monday with 76 migrants aboard the first and 106 on the second. Guatemala’s foreign ministry did not immediately clarify why the U.S. had not complied with its requirements, but the flights came on the same day that the U.S. State Department announced that aid would continue to Guatemala and the other Northern Triangle countries.
One of Monday’s flights also included 16 unaccompanied minors, according to the Guatemalan Immigration Institute.
Since January, the U.S. has deported nearly 12,000 Guatemalans, including more than 1,200 children.
Citing the epidemic, the U.S. has started swiftly deporting unaccompanied minors rather than holding them in protective settings as specified by law.
Also on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that he had informed Congress that the U.S. government would continue assistance for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in order to continue to lower illegal immigration and accomplish other policy objectives.
Pompeo said that since illegal immigration from those three countries peaked in May 2019, “encounters” with migrants from those countries had fallen by 76%. The U.S. government has effectively ended any possibility of seeking asylum at the southern border with emergency restrictions applied in the face of the epidemic.
Before the epidemic, the U.S. had also started sending Hondurans and Salvadorans to Guatemala and similarly had agreements in place to begin doing so in Honduras and El Salvador.
Deportations from the U.S. have continued despite the outbreak. The United States holds about 34,000 people in immigration detention, down from about 37,000 last month.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says 77 detainees have tested positive for the coronavirus.
Acting Deputy Homeland Security Director Ken Cuccinelli told reporters Tuesday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has released nearly 700 people from immigration detention around the country because their age or health conditions made them vulnerable to the virus. He also said authorities were taking steps to ensure that people who may have been exposed in custody are kept separate from other detainees.
“ICE is certainly committed to ensuring that comprehensive medical care is provided for all of their detainees from the moment they arrive in ICE custody through the entirety of their state,” Cuccinelli said.
The administration on Friday issued a memo authorizing the use of visa sanctions to punish any nation that “denies or unreasonably delays” taking its citizens as they are deported from the U.S. amid tightened border enforcement imposed last month as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Officials have declined to identify any countries that may have prompted the announcement.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Their landlords are kicking them out for not paying the rent, despite moratoriums on evictions in more than 30 states and dozens of cities.
Robert Stephenson’s lawyer says an illegal eviction put the 49-year-old diabetic veteran on the street. Stephenson had been living in a New Orleans guesthouse for four months with his girlfriend, Jade Gribanov, who is known locally as Jade the Tarot Reader from Jackson Square, when COVID-19 hit. Jade’s income disappeared as tourism stopped, and Stephenson was still in the process of applying for disability benefits. When the couple’s savings ran out, the guesthouse told them to leave. They were worried about ending up in jail or clashing with police if they resisted, so they left; Jade and the couple’s two cats went to live with family in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Stephenson ended up sleeping under the Claiborne Avenue Bridge. 
“Within an hour’s time, I’d lost my girlfriend, my two cats, and my place,” says Stephenson, who left his possessions, including photos, clothes, and medications, at the guesthouse. 
Housing attorneys say that they’ve seen a flood of similar cases nationwide since the economic collapse precipitated by the spread of COVID-19. Only 69% of apartment tenants had paid their monthly rent by April 5, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council, down from 81% the previous month.

Some landlords change the locks when tenants are out. Others cut off power or utilities, or let themselves into tenants’ apartments and throw their stuff onto the street. Landlords also take the doors off the hinges if tenants won’t leave, says George Donnelly, an attorney at The Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia. In most cases, experts say, the evictions are illegal, since landlords are required to go through the courts to evict tenants, and most courts are not currently processing eviction orders. In addition, sheriffs or marshals, not landlords, are supposed to enforce eviction orders, including supervising removal companies to carry away a tenant’s belongings if the renter refuses to leave.
“What seems to be happening is that landlords are really losing patience with the courts,” says Cole Thaler, the co-director of the Safe and Stable Homes Project at the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, a nonprofit that provides free legal aid to low-income Atlanta residents. “They’re doing self-help evictions.” Thaler used to get two or three calls a month about illegal evictions but now says he’s getting three or four a week. 
As the economy cratered, tenants and landlords alike faced not only income shortfalls but a confusing patchwork of laws, bans, and suspensions. Consider: Though at least 39 states have announced some form of eviction moratorium, and dozens of cities have banned utility shutoffs in response to COVID-19, there are ways for landlords to push out tenants. Only nine states have banned landlords from sending eviction notices to tenants, according to Emily Benfer, a visiting associate clinical professor of law at Columbia Law School. Tenants who receive such notices may get nervous and move out, even if they’re protected by a moratorium, says Benfer, who has worked with other attorneys to compile a database of state and local eviction policies during COVID-19.
The CARES Act passed by Congress in March prohibits evictions for 120 days, but it only applies to renters in properties secured by federally-backed mortgages, which account for one in four rental properties, according to the Urban Institute. That leaves most tenants dependent on state or local laws to avoid illegal evictions. “This has truly exposed the inadequacy of our social safety net,” says Benfer. 
Even in states with eviction moratoriums, many renters are not completely protected. There are several steps in an eviction, including giving notice to a tenant, filing a case in court, and having a judge give the go-ahead for an eviction to proceed. But only 20 states are preventing law enforcement from carrying out eviction orders, and only Connecticut and New Hampshire have frozen every step in the process, according to Benfer. 
“Very few states have put into place all the freezes that are necessary,” she says. 
In Alaska, California, Maryland, and several other states, tenants must show proof that their financial hardship is related to COVID-19 in order to be protected from eviction. Colorado and Ohio are among the states that have left decisions on evictions up to local jurisdictions, while Arkansas is allowing judges to conduct eviction hearings remotely. Sheriffs in many jurisdictions are enforcing evictions that were approved before the COVID-19 financial crisis; the Fresno County sheriff in California carried out evictions until April 1, according to Tony Botti, a spokesperson for the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office. Also in California, Riverside County sheriffs are still carrying out evictions that were approved before COVID-19, according to Riverside Sheriff Sergeant Deanna Pecoraro. 
In Massachusetts, 602 new eviction cases were filed in state housing courts between March 16 and April 13, meaning many tenants received letters terminating their tenancy and were served by a constable with a complaint advising them of a court date, says Andrea Park, the housing and homelessness attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. In some cases, tenants received auto-generated notices summoning them to court after COVID-19 had closed the courthouse. 
Only Connecticut has in place a grace period that gives tenants extra time to pay back rent after that state’s eviction moratorium ends. That means that once courts across the country re-open, there will be a flood of evictions, says Alieza Durana of the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, which maintains a national database of evictions. Apartment owners point out that they are also struggling, since they have expenses piling up as tenants stop paying rent. This could begin soon, as some states’ moratoriums are set to expire before or on April 30; an order in Idaho mandating that courts conduct reduced operations expires April 15.
Apartment owners point out that they are also struggling, since they have expenses piling up as tenants stop paying rent. On average, only 9 cents of every $1 of rent collected is returned to owners, according to the National Apartment Association; 39 cents goes to the mortgage, and the rest goes to taxes, payroll, and property improvements. In cities like Orlando, some landlords have entire buildings of tenants who worked for theme parks that have shut down, says Bob Pinnegar, the CEO of the National Apartment Association. Though apartment owners anticipated they’d be able to get small business loans under the CARES Act, that hasn’t been the case, he says.
While many renters should receive one-time $1,200 checks from the government and extra unemployment benefits of $600 a week under the CARES Act, that money has yet to land in most people’s wallets, and it won’t be enough to cover all expenses. COVID-19 hit in an era where housing prices were rising faster than wages, and many people were already struggling to pay the rent. Only one in four families who qualify for government housing assistance receive it; as a result, millions of people in the U.S. spend more than half their income on rent, according to Matthew Desmond, a sociology professor at Princeton and the author of the book: Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City. Desmond says that before COVID-19, cities like Richmond, Virginia and Wilmington, Delaware already had high eviction rates, with 1 in 13 renter households evicted annually in each city. There’s no telling what will happen when housing courts in such cities resume.
Going through an eviction has been shown to cause depression and can lead to job loss; a court record of an eviction can also prevent families from finding new housing. “You find people moving into worse housing and neighborhoods than they were in before,” Desmond says. Since people evicted during COVID-19 have little chance of being able to put down a deposit for a new room until the crisis wanes, many are ending up on the street. 
Even for those who successfully fight eviction, the stress of how to make missed rent payments is piling up. Carla and Ricky Phelan were evicted on March 25 from the Springfield, Illinois motel where they’d been living, despite an eviction moratorium in effect since March 20. Ricky Phelan, 58, had worked in retail until suffering a stroke in 2019; Carla, 52, was working at a Subway but had her hours reduced. A lawyer with Land of Lincoln Legal Aid brought their case to court, and a judge agreed that they had been wrongfully evicted, so the couple moved back into the motel two days after being kicked out. 
The experience was “terrifying,” Carla Phelan says. But now, there’s another worry. Every night, the motel slips a bill under the couple’s door tallying the $60 nightly payments they’ve missed; so far, they owe more than $700, and the amount grows daily. “We’re still stressing here,” says Carla Phelan.
In some places—typically cities with strong renter protections and clear directions to police about how to handle illegal lockouts—evictions are not as big a problem. “The level of compliance we see is directly related to the state of landlord-tenant law, and to the amount of protections tenants have,” says Cashauna Hill, executive director of the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, which provides free counseling and legal services to tenants. 
Even before the current pandemic, New York City landlords faced fines of at least $1,000 if they locked out tenants without going through the proper channels, says Andrea Shapiro, program manager of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a New York city tenants’ rights group. That makes landlords think twice about throwing people out if they’re behind on rent. Tenants who are evicted have options: they can go to housing court or to their local police precinct to complain. The New York Police Department patrol officers’ guide makes it clear that under New York law, anyone who has occupied an apartment for 30 days, whether or not they have a lease, may not be evicted without a court order and a warrant.
In places without such protections, tenants’ advocates recommend that renters call the police if they have been evicted illegally. Whenever they leave their residence, they should carry a piece of mail or other proof of residence in case they need to report an illegal lockout. Elena Popp, an attorney with the Eviction Defense Network in Los Angeles, is recommending that vulnerable tenants record all interactions with landlords trying to evict them and post signs on their doors advising landlords to put all demands in writing. 
Getting recourse for an illegal eviction anytime soon will be a challenge. In Georgia, for instance, if the police don’t stop the eviction, tenants must file for emergency relief, which would probably entail a temporary restraining order against the landlord, says Lindsey Siegel, a senior attorney at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society who works on housing issues. This must be done in Superior Court, and it would be difficult for a tenant without a lawyer to file such a case, she says.
""This has truly exposed the inadequacy of our social safety net.""
Though some advocacy groups are calling for a rent freeze in response to COVID-19, others say a better solution may be to include rent assistance in a future stimulus bill. That could take the form of government funding to kick in once the extra unemployment benefit of $600 a week runs out in August, or emergency checks to immediately help renters who are not getting unemployment benefits, says Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. It’s an idea that apartment owners also support; in a letter to Congress on April 7, the National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association asked for an emergency assistance fund for renter households. (One property owner, Camden Property Trust, created its own $5 million emergency relief fund for renters; within 16 minutes, it had received 2,520 applications.)
For people who have already been evicted, any emergency assistance may come too late. James Gray, a 49-year old construction worker, has been out on the street since April 10 after being evicted from the Las Vegas motel where he’d been living. When construction jobs started to dry up as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the country, Gray says he paid what he could, sometimes as much as $80 toward the $113 nightly bill. But on April 6, the motel told him to leave, despite a Nevada moratorium on evictions in effect since March 29. 
Gray says that after he insisted that the moratorium should protect him, motel security started banging on the door and eventually called the police to accuse Gray of trespassing. (The motel did not respond to a request for comment.)
Gray is afraid to go to a homeless shelter for fear of being exposed to the coronavirus, and to make matters worse, he can’t even sleep in his car. He says the motel had it towed, and it would cost him more than $670—money he doesn’t have—to retrieve it.

11,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",ARNIE STAPLETON / AP,NFL Star Von Miller Tests Positive for Coronavirus,The Broncos linebacker is one of the highest-profile American athletes to announce he's contracted COVID-19.,https://time.com/5823180/nfl-von-miller-coronavirus/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/von-miller.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,2020-04-17T09:28:55Z,"(AURORA, Colo.) — Von Miller has the coronavirus and the NFL star wanted to come forward with his diagnosis to show people how serious the disease is.
“I’m going to do whatever I have to do to get thru this!” Miller wrote in an Instagram post Thursday night. “Take this seriously. It’s definitely FOR REAL.”
The Super Bowl MVP is the highest-profile American athlete to announce he’s contracted COVID-19. Last month, NBA star Kevin Durant was among several members of the Brooklyn Nets to test positive.
“Von wants to let everyone out there know it’s serious; it doesn’t just happen to old people in nursing homes,” agent Joby Branion told The Associated Press on Thursday.
Miller told KUSA-TV in Denver that he developed a cough a couple of days ago and when his nebulizer for his asthma didn’t clear things up, he decided to get tested for the coronavirus and the test came back positive Thursday.
“I’m in good spirits,” Miller told the TV station. “I’m not feeling sick or hurting or anything like that.”
The Broncos released a statement, saying Miller “elected to share his diagnosis publicly to emphasize that anyone can be afflicted with coronavirus.”
“Von is doing well and recovering at home in self-isolation. He remains under the care of team doctors, who are following all coronavirus treatment procedures to ensure a safe environment for Von and our community,” the team added.
Branion said that aside from his allergy to grass, the 31-year-old Miller is the picture of health.
“Von lives to take care of his health and his body and it hit him, too,” Branion said. “Hopefully, he’s like the 85 percent who kick this disease in the teeth in two weeks. But the bottom line is he got it, too.”
Brandion said Miller is in good spirits while quarantined at his home in the Denver area and that the Broncos linebacker plans to speak publicly about his diagnosis on Friday.
Branion said Miller went for a test after he began coughing a couple of days ago and consulted with the Broncos medical team.
“I’ve seen him a lot sicker after games. He’s allergic to grass and after he’s been inundated with pollen, he’s sounded worse,” Branion said.
Miller, who was recently a unanimous pick to the NFL’s All-Decade team of the 2010s, said on a conference call last week he trained in San Francisco before returning home to Colorado when the stay-at-home measures went into effect to contain the virus.
Branion said Miller isn’t sure how he became infected.
“He’s been home for a month. Now, is he in lock-down, lock-down? No, but he’s been sort of staying home,” Branion said. “What happened? We don’t know.
“But it can get you. It got him, and he’s Superman!”
Miller is the second active NFL player to acknowledge testing positive during the coronavirus pandemic that has sickened more than 2 million people worldwide, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and sending millions into unemployment.
On Wednesday, Los Angeles Rams center Brian Allen said he tested positive for COVID-19 three weeks ago. New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton revealed last month that he tested positive for the virus. The Los Angeles Chargers last week revealed a positive test and symptoms for unidentified members of their organization.
And in Denver, three unidentified Colorado Avalanche players have tested positive for the coronavirus.

In a state where at least 25 victims have died — 19 of them from the same suburban Seattle nursing home — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee prohibited activities involving more than 250 people. The ban, encompassing an area of 4 million residents, applies to houses of worship and baseball’s Seattle Mariners, whose home games will be moved.
“This is not just your ordinary flu,” Inslee said. “This demands a response consistent with the nature of the threat.”
In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed banned all gatherings 1,000 or more people for the next two weeks in the city of 880,000, including Golden State Warriors basketball games. California’s Santa Clara County, home to San Jose and Silicon Valley, did the same.
The Seattle public school system, which has about 53,000 students, also announced that it would close, starting Thursday.
The all-out drive to encourage “social distancing” — the new catchphrase amid the crisis — unfolded as infections in the U.S. topped 1,000 and the death toll climbed to at least 33. The outbreak has spread to as many as 40 states, with Arkansas and New Mexico reporting their first cases of the virus.
“Bottom line, it’s going to get worse,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Capitol Hill.
As for how much worse, Fauci said that would depend on the ability of the U.S. to curtail the influx of travelers carrying the disease and state and community efforts to contain the outbreak. He said if mild cases of the virus are counted, the mortality rate is probably about 1 percent — “roughly 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.”
On Wall Street, investors endured another brutal day, with fears about the virus’ economic fallout driving stocks down about 5 percent on news that the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic, or a serious global outbreak. WHO noted that the number of cases outside China increased 13-fold over the past two weeks.
Designating the crisis a pandemic is WHO’s way of putting countries on notice to take more aggressive action against the virus, which has infected over 120,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 4,400.
In the U.S., the Seattle area has been hit hardest of all.
Dr. Jeff Duchin, public health officer with Seattle and King County, said the region is facing an unprecedented health emergency as the number of cases doubles every few days.
“We expect a large-scale outbreak in weeks, and this will be a very difficult time,” he said. “It’s similar to what you might think of as an infectious-disease equivalent of a major earthquake that’s going to shake us for weeks and weeks.”

Inslee said government has the authority to crack down on groups or individuals who ignore the directive, but added that he expects people will abide by the order. Asked about penalties for violations, he said: “The penalties are you might be killing your granddad if you don’t do it.”
Elsewhere around the country, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear urged churches across the state to cancel services.
“I don’t believe that whether you go to church during this period of time is a test of faith,” he said. “I believe God gives us wisdom to protect each other and we should do that.”
Massachusetts is dealing with of cluster of at least 70 cases connected to a meeting held last month by biotech company Biogen at a hotel in Boston, while a cluster of over 100 infections in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle prompted the closing of schools and houses of worship, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo announcing plans to send in the National Guard to sanitize public places and deliver food to those who are quarantined.
Penn State, Swarthmore, West Virginia’s Marshall University, the University of Virginia and the University of Wisconsin at Madison joined the rapidly expanding list of schools announcing plans to send students home and hold classes remotely.
Chicago canceled its St. Patrick’s Day parade, joining Boston and Philadelphia. Instead of hosting 100,000 at its twice-yearly conference in Salt Lake City next month, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said it will hold the gathering online and on TV, with leaders delivering speeches without any attendees. The National Association of Broadcasters canceled its annual trade show, scheduled for April in Las Vegas. It typically draws 100,000 people.
For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially the elderly and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks, as has happened with the majority of those infected in China, the virus’ country of origin.
Tests by U.S. government scientists and other experts found that the virus can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for two to three days.
For those in the middle of a quarantine, it’s an anxious time waiting for the threat to pass.
Judy Aqua, who is in her 60s, is quarantining herself at home in New Rochelle after possibly being exposed to someone with the virus.
“People are really afraid to go to the supermarket. They’re afraid to go to the cleaner,” she said. When her husband made a recent run to a post office, she told him to wear gloves.
Some airport workers are also dealing with the outbreak, with several Transportation Security Administration officers at the San Jose airport testing positive. All TSA employees who had contact with them over the past 14 days are being quarantined at home, the agency said.
In Oakland, California, restless passengers on a coronavirus-struck cruise ship awaited their turn to disembark. By Tuesday night, Princess Cruises said about 1,400 of the 3,500 people on board had gotten off, and efforts were underway to move them to quarantine in their home countries or at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly warned the elderly to stay away from cruise ships.

13,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Tara Law,‘We Carry That Burden.’ Medical Workers Fighting COVID-19 Are Facing a Mental Health Crisis,Doctors and nurses are frightened for themselves and the patients they're treating amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.,https://time.com/5817435/covid-19-mental-health-coronavirus/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MGH-Nurse.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,2020-04-10T18:03:06Z,"As a critical care doctor in New York City, Monica is used to dealing with high-octane situations and treating severely ill patients. But she says the COVID-19 outbreak is unlike anything she’s seen before. Over the past few weeks, operating rooms have been transformed into ICUs, physicians of all backgrounds have been drafted into emergency room work, and two of her colleagues became ICU patients. While Monica is proud of her coworkers for rising to the challenge, she says it’s been hard for them to fight a prolonged battle against a deadly, highly contagious illness with no known cure.
To make matters worse, Monica recently tested positive for COVID-19, and she believes she brought the virus home to her husband. Both have gotten sick and are improving, but he had a much harder time with the disease than she did. Monica says that, while she’s used the inherent risk of her job, she feels her hospital failed to protect her and her family — and she blames herself, in part, for her husband’s illness. “There’s this sinking feeling that you have,” says Monica, who requested anonymity because she feared professional repercussions for speaking candidly, “not only, like, the hospital let you down, and that the system let us down as doctors and didn’t protect us, but then I didn’t protect my own family.”
In hospitals around the world, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers like Monica are fighting an enemy that has already killed more than 95,000 people, including over 16,000 in the United States. And as with any war, the fight against COVID-19 will result not just in direct casualties, but also take a terrible toll on the minds of many of those who survive.
It will be years before the mental health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is fully understood, but some early data already paints a bleak picture. A study published March 23 in the medical journal JAMA found that, among 1,257 healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients in China, 50.4% reported symptoms of depression, 44.6% symptoms of anxiety, 34% insomnia, and 71.5% reported distress. Nurses and other frontline workers were among those with the most severe symptoms. 
In interviews with TIME, several doctors and nurses said that fighting COVID-19 is making them feel more dedicated to their profession, and determined to push through and help their patients. However, many also admitted to harboring darker feelings. They’re afraid of spreading the disease to their families, frustrated about a lack of adequate protective gear and a sense they can’t do enough for their patients, exhausted as hours have stretched longer without a clear end in sight, and, most of all, deeply sad for their dying patients, many of whom are slipping away without their loved ones at their side.
It’s those lonely deaths that have hit the hardest for some. Natalie Jones, an ICU-registered nurse at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton in New Jersey, says it’s been agonizing to have to turn away people who want to visit their loved ones one last time. She’s trying to find ways to be compassionate where she can — last week, she passed on a message from a patient’s wife just before he died: “That they love him, and it’s O.K. to go.” But even simply carrying a message of such emotional weight can take a toll. 
“We carry that burden for the families, too,” says Jones, who’s having difficultly sleeping without nightmares. “And we understand it’s so difficult that they can’t be there. And that hurts us too. As nurses, we’re healers, and we’re compassionate. It hits very close to home for us as well.”
“We’re all affected,” adds Jones, whose already hectic schedule has gotten even more intense amid the outbreak, costing her the sleep that might otherwise help her cope with what she’s experiencing. “To say that we’re not would be a lie.”
The coronavirus is taking a mental toll even on those medical experts who aren’t on the front lines. Since the start of the outbreak, Dr. Morgan Katz, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, has been advising nursing homes and long-term care centers on dealing with the coronavirus. But she’s struggling with the gap between what she believes to be the proper procedures and what’s actually possible in this crisis. Many of the facilities she’s advising are suffering from a lack of protective equipment, limited staffing and insufficient testing, and a sense of helplessness is taking hold.
“We didn’t have the resources before this that we needed, and this has completely strapped them beyond anything feasible,” says Katz. “It’s so sad. I really feel for these nursing homes and the staff of these nursing homes, because I truly believe that they’re trying to do the right thing. But I really don’t feel like they’re being protected the way that we need to protect them.”
Finding ways to support medical workers’ mental health could be a key component in the fight against COVID-19. Dr. Albert Wu, professor of health policy and management and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that evidence from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that failing to support healthcare workers in a crisis, including by not providing enough protective gear, can erode their “wellbeing and resilience,” ultimately leading to chronic burnout. Some healthcare workers could leave the profession, be absent more often from work, or develop PTSD, and any preexisting mental health conditions could be exacerbated. Furthermore, healthcare workers are human like the rest of us, and under extreme stress, they could be prone to making mistakes — which could lead to worse outcomes for patients, and further erode doctors’ and nurses’ mental health. “We can’t get away from our physiology,” says Wu. 
If healthcare workers can’t provide the care they typically believe is medically necessary for their patients, they may experience a phenomenon known as “moral injury,” says Dr. Wendy Dean, a psychiatrist and the co-founder of the nonprofit Fix Moral Injury. Dean says that American healthcare providers are used to doing anything and everything to help their patients, but inadequate protective gear and triage procedures will force them to make “exquisitely painful” decisions, such as choosing whether or not to risk infecting themselves, their family and other patients in order to help everyone in their care. 
Still, Dean says the scope of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers won’t come into focus until the more immediate problem has ebbed. 
“When I think the real challenge is going to come is when the pandemic eases up and people start having time to process,” she says. “All that they’ve seen, all that they’ve done, all that they’ve felt and pushed away.”
Several healthcare workers said that, amid all the uncertainty and horrors, they have found some relief in drawing upon support from their families, communities, and one another. Monica, for one, says her friends brought food to her and her husband after they got sick, and she deeply appreciated the support. She’s also proud of the way her colleagues have come together as a team to fight the virus. “There has been a real feeling of, everybody’s in the trenches together,” she says. “What I’ve been most amazed about is people have really risen to that call.”

A Rhode Island-based musician who earns money through a combination of tours and teaching, Blount is one of several independent artists across multiple disciplines whose careers have been set back by widespread event cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier in March, the banjo and fiddle player was en route to the airport to travel to a music festival in Norway when he got word that it was canceled because of the coronavirus—the first of many gigs planned through June 2020 that he would see called off or delayed. So far, Blount says he’s lost between $3,000 and $4,000 in missed paychecks. 
“It’s going to be a difficult few weeks as I figure out how to pay for all these things,” Blount tells TIME, citing upcoming tax payments among his primary concerns. “I am definitely a little bit on edge.”
To build a slight monetary cushion, Blount is teaching extra music lessons as he figures out whether to cancel or delay an upcoming tour for his new album due in May. “Right now, I have all the time in the world,” he says. “I want to take this time to be creative and think about what I want to experiment with musically.”
Many artists are facing similarly precarious futures as the coronavirus pandemic causes the postponement or cancellation of concert tours, book festivals and major events like South by Southwest (SXSW) and Coachella, along with the closure of movie theaters and independent bookstores. From musicians to filmmakers to writers, working artists are growing increasingly unsure of where they’ll be able to share and sell their work as COVID-19 continues to sweep the globe. 
The cancelation of the Austin, Tex. tech, music and film festival SXSW, originally set to take place from March 13 to March 22, has thrown filmmaker Noah Hutton’s first feature into uncertainty. Hutton planned to premiere his sci-fi debut, Lapsis, at SXSW in hopes of generating media buzz and, eventually, landing a distributor to buy the film. 
“We were crushed by the cancellation,” Hutton tells TIME. “But you get accustomed to crazy things happening when making a low-budget film. Now the question is, how can we continue on and get this film out into the world?” 
The filmmaker Jeremy Hersh is in a similar situation—scheduled to premiere his first feature, a queer drama called The Surrogate, at SXSW, the director is hoping to instead garner attention for the film by having critics screen it themselves and write reviews. Some publications have already reviewed the film, and though Hersh has not yet heard from any distributors, knowing that people have watched the movie helps him “remain hopeful as ever.” “It’s helping my mood,” he says.
While both Hutton and Hersh have the option of releasing their films online for viewers, putting them out for free would prevent the directors from being able to sell their movies and show them in theaters. Streaming platforms like Netflix or Hulu stepping up to buy the movies would be a huge help, both say. 
“It is unprecedented, what’s going on,” Hutton says. “I hope there’s a way one of these platforms can look at these films, including ours, and enter this space in a way they might not usually do.”

Other artists are using their unique skills to drum up business and connect with others where they can—both to keep earning money and to stay active as people everywhere self-isolate to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
The writer Bonnie Tsui, whose nonfiction book Why We Swim is due out on April 14, will not be able to celebrate and promote her work on the national tour she had previously planned. The financial implications of the canceled events are not yet clear to Tsui. To combat the stress of uncertain times, Tsui is hosting regular “virtual community swims,” in which she invites other writers, swimmers and those she calls “water people” to gather online and talk about swimming and writing. The approach allows her to continue engaging with an audience about her book, while staying inside during the outbreak.
“It’s like having pen pals,” she says. “I talk to illustrators, writers, journalists and athletes. It breathes a different kind of life into the book.”
When the hardcore Pittsburgh-based band Code Orange realized their record release show for their new LP Underneath would have to be canceled, the group quickly shifted tactics and livestreamed the concert from the Roxian Theater over Twitch. The visually driven show, which featured several videos that used CGI, drew nearly 13,000 viewers at its peak. Code Orange streamed the show for free. To somewhat offset the loss the band incurred by having to cancel its live show, Code Orange sold merchandise online and posted a link to its PayPal account so people could donate money, lead singer Jami Morgan tells TIME. 
Like many who currently depend on paid gigs to make a living, Code Orange will postpone its planned tour in support of the new album. The livestream, which broadcast on March 14, was an inventive way for the band to cope with having “no clue” what the coming weeks and months will look like, Morgan says. 
“It’s tough for artists. There’s nothing set up for any of us. The people who run this world don’t seem to have cared enough to prepare all of us for this situation,” Morgan says. “But we are creative people, we are resourceful, we have a strong backbone of art. That’s going to carry us.”

For World War II veterans and survivors of the Great Depression, the outbreak seemed like a comparatively meek threat. But Bobbi Trask, minister of member care, explained that to help defeat the virus, they need to show “a different kind of strength.”
“You have to now pull up from inside of you the same kind of bravery that you have experienced through the Great Depression and through wars … along with the same sense of sacrifice. Because if you get sick, you are going to cause others to get sick,” Trask says she told her congregants. “And with that, they knew how to rally. It was like, ‘ok, we can do this for the greater good.’” In her view, the trust she’s built with her congregation — both as a church leader and friend who leads them in bible study — helped her to bring home the importance of caution.
“They know how much how I love them,” says Trask. “I do think that not only myself but our church has built up a credibility of care with them, and so they trust us.”

While taking part in religious gatherings and rituals in churches, synagogues, mosques and around kitchen tables has long helped build connections between people, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed these traditions into potential threats for entire communities. Because mass gatherings can accelerate the spread of COVID-19, religious communities across the country have been forced to cancel in-person services, and to put everything from baptisms to bar and bat mitzvahs to weddings on hold. (Some religious leaders have, controversially, continued in-person services, a move that health experts say puts people at unnecessary risk.)
But instead of going into hibernation for the duration of the outbreak, many religious communities have instead expanded their role in the lives of their members and the wider community, getting together online, on the phone, and in other physically distant yet emotionally connected ways. As many Americans are largely isolated at home due to the pandemic, both formal and informal religious groups are finding new ways to meet the spiritual, psychological and even day-to-day physical needs of their congregants.
Dennis Sasso, the senior rabbi at Congregation Beth-El Zedeck in Indianapolis, Indiana, believes he has two main roles during the COVID-19 crisis: making sure his congregants are cared for emotionally and spiritually, and reminding them to following health experts’ directives. His congregation has streamed religious services and even a talk with a public health expert.
“As a faith leader, what I can say to the community is, listen to the medical and scientific advice,” says Sasso. Follow all the protocols. Follow the directives that will keep us healthy. Science and medicine will help us uncover the cure. The purpose of religion and faith is to provide the healing that community and wisdom and tradition can bring.”
For many congregations, expanding their digital reach has been a crucial part of helping their congregants to remain connected. Denise Fredrickson, a member of the vestry at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Yardley, Penn., says that her church has been releasing all of its religious services online, as well as many secular activities, including yoga and poetry readings. The church is even planning to conduct a digital performance of Shakespeare’s King Lear. According to Fredrickson, some of the sermons and events have attracted hundreds of people on Facebook — far more than typically attend the church’s activities in person, suggesting some who don’t typically attend services are turning to religion in a time of crisis.
“It’s like a lifeline,” said Fredrickson. “Because you don’t realize, sometimes, how closed-off this has become. But this has been a way for all of us to engage, to see faces, to post how we’re feeling and really communicate.”
Others have found ways to take their personal religious or cultural practices online in smaller-scale ways. Cathy Costin and her friends have gathered together to celebrate Shabbat for roughly 25 years, but this March was the first time the group decided to hold the dinner online. Costin says that, while she doesn’t believe in God, she found the experience to be particularly powerful — especially because many of the group’s adult children participated in the dinner despite living in far-away states.
“There’s something about those traditions,” says Costin. “There’s something about lighting those candles, and drinking that wine, and blessing the bread, that is incredibly comforting at a time like this”.
Places of worship are also finding ways to organize support for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Religious leaders at Trask’s Fremont Presbyterian Church have enlisted many of their younger congregants to support the church’s elders, for instance. A group of college students delivers groceries and drives people to doctor’s appointments. drives people to urgent doctor’s appointments. Middle-aged congregants call the seniors once a week to check in and offer a chance to chat. And the congregation’s very youngest members have been sending the seniors drawings and cards, which slightly older children put in envelopes and deliver to the mailbox.
The congregants’ faith, Trask says, means that they’re “supposed to step up and help.” “We’re supposed to do that all the time,” he adds, “but especially in these situations — and especially when fear is a huge factor. Because we’re demonstrating faith.”

But there could be a number of risks in trying to get pregnant right now.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/health/baby-boom-wellness-scn-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200318154449-newborn-babies-hosptial-stock-super-tease.jpg,2020-04-05T12:41:33Z,"(CNN)As much of the world settles into a new routine of social distancing, couples are likely to have a lot more free time at home to snuggle together.
At first blush, you might think couples with some extra time on their hands would do things that could lead to a stork visiting nine months from now.
Yet with US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warning of dire scenarios and a possible 20% unemployment rate, couples whose jobs are vulnerable in this economy are likely to think again about kicking off their parenting journeys this spring.
Then there's the possibility of more couples splitting up. One marriage registry official in China said he saw a quarantine-related spike in divorces, showing that more time in closed quarters may be doing some couples more harm than good.
But for couples weathering this storm together, is this a time when many will choose to add to their brood?
Baby booms can follow smaller storms
""I don't foresee a baby boom in nine months,"" Dr. Renee Wellenstein, an OB/GYN and functional medicine specialist in upstate New York, told CNN.
In a less severe context, like a snowstorm, sure -- it's quite common to see an uptick in births nine months later.
She noted that couples spend more time cozying up indoors during the late fall and winter. Consequently, ""in the northeast we see more babies in the late summer and fall months,"" she said.
Studies back up her clinical observations.
A 2007 paper by scientists at the University of Texas and Johns Hopkins University argued that relatively minor storm advisory events that caused power outages had slight positive effects in boosting the birth rate. However, the ""highest-severity"" storms causing death and destruction had a demonstrable negative impact, reducing the birth rate.
But larger disasters can lower birth rates
""Illness, quarantine and death can all have a major impact on conception, pregnancy and birth,"" scholar Lyman Stone wrote in an article published in March by theInstitute for Family Studies.
""Previous academic literature has shown that high-mortality events as diverse as famines, earthquakes, heatwaves and disease all have very predictable effects on reducing births nine months later,"" he said.
Stone looked at birth trends following recent catastrophes, including Hurricanes Maria and Katrina in the US as well as the 2015 Ebola outbreaks in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Those all led to marked declines in birth rates.
One major progression leaps out: ""Events that cause a large increase in deaths tend to cause a large decrease in births nine months later,"" Stone writes.
On the flip side, events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Oklahoma City bombingmay have led to higher birth rates, due in part to their effect on the American psyche, causing couples to cling more closely together.
It may actually be hard to get pregnant right now
Although being snowed in can be a little fun and lead to romance, the pandemic is stressful for couples: ""[The] libido is down and menstrual cycles may be off,"" Wellenstein said. ""It may not be possible to conceive due to this.""
But for couples who still have the urge, Wellenstein said she would ""absolutely not"" advise anyone to get pregnant now, due to the uncertainty swirling around Covid-19. ""You can push off conceiving and getting pregnant,"" she said.
There are a number of risk factors, starting with the fact that there's simply less care available in many areas as hospitals prioritize more resources toward helping the surge of Covid-19 patients being admitted.
And for women who are already pregnant, each trip to the hospital during the pandemic carries additional risk.
""It's never ideal to have any infectious disease during the pregnancy due tothe unknown impact on the child,"" Wellenstein said. ""To enter a hospital puts her at risk.""
Regardless of where the science ultimately lands on transmission of the novel coronavirus in the placenta, it's a risk not worth taking, Wellenstein says. Once the baby is born, we know with certainty that she is at risk from any virus carriers she may come in contact with. 
There's a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus
While we don't know with certainty yet, preliminary studies available so far appear to argue against coronavirus being transmitted during pregnancy. 
A study recently published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics focused on 33 pregnant women who were infected with coronavirus. It showed that in the first week of their lives, just three of the newborns tested positive.
But experts believe the babies contracted the virus once they were out in the world -- and not while in their mothers' wombs.
""As all infants had amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood tested for Covid-19 with negative results, this is evidence against the virus being transmitted from mother to fetus via the placenta,"" Dr. Andrew Whitelaw, emeritus professor of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol, told the Science Media Centre in the UK.
Nevertheless, doctors have concern about whether a mother could expose her child to the virus after birth.
Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that she was fearful of being infected during a critical time in her life -- and her baby's. 
""I am almost 39 weeks pregnant as of the time that we are speaking,"" she said. ""I mean, I have a recurring nightmare myself of contracting Covid-19, and going through childbirth where I have to wear a mask.""
""And if my newborn were to get ill,"" Wen continued, ""she would become extremely ill because she doesn't have immunity and little babies are so fragile. And I know of so many other pregnant women who have their own anxieties in this time. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory virus, if the mom were to cough and then she coughed onto her hand and then her hand touched the baby, she could infect her newborn that way.""
The CDC's recommendations include having safeguards to separate the mom and the newborn.
Wait until things return to normal
It's still too soon to make any substantive birth rate forecasts. We don't know how long this year's pandemic will remain vicious, what the long-term effects on young people are, or how far and wide a deepening global economic recession might reach.
History does have examples of a surging birth rate after tragedy: The historic Baby Boom generation is composed of those born in America's post-World War II years between 1946 and 1964.
Scholars point to many causes, but generally agree that following the tumult of the Great Depression and World War II, couples found it more realistic to raise children in the relative calm and economic prosperity following the war.
The birth rate ebbs and flows. And with any coronavirus-related baby boom, it could manifest once things feel safe again.
Though Stone says the coronavirus could lead to a short-term slump, his analysis shows that birth rates could rebound again over the next one to five years.
""A couple months after this situation resolves you might start to see more pregnancies,"" Wellenstein said."

Hydroxychloroquine has been heavily touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for COVID-19. The medication has not been proven effective or safe for treating the virus in clinical studies.
A spokesperson for the FAA confirmed the action in an email to Business Insider.
""As with all drugs, the FAA takes a conservative approach when evaluating how a particular substance interacts with aviation professionals and the ability to do their jobs safely,"" the spokesperson said. ""Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were both reviewed by the FAA Federal Air Surgeon when they entered the market and have long been considered generally incompatible for those performing safety related aviation duties.""
""Due to the wide variety of dosages and lack of standardized protocols for treating COVID-19, pilots using these medications are disqualified from performing safety related duties until 48 hours after they have stopped using them.""
The new directive was first reported by CNN. 
According to CNN, the original FAA guidance said that there is ""no satisfactory scientific evidence that use of these medications decreases the severity of the virus.""
""Exercise of social distancing and hand washing represent a far more effective means of prevention,"" the guidance said, according to CNN. ""As information changes, we will update our policy based on the best scientific evidence available to us.""
Hydroxychloroquine has been a contentious subject as the world searches for a way to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Several doctors have reported anecdotal evidence that the antimalariall has helped patients with the novel coronavirus, but medical professionals have also warned of the possibility of serious and potentially life-threatening side effects, including cardiac arrhythmia.
The FAA does allow exceptions for pilots with arthritis to take small doses of the medication. Those pilots are typically required to pass an eye exam and meet other criteria in order to receive a special certification.

Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge
Two weeks after beginning to survey users about disease symptoms in an effort to track the spread of COVID-19, Facebook said Monday that early results showed promise and that the effort will roll out internationally beginning Wednesday. Carnegie Mellon University, which conducts the survey, said that 150,000 people a day are now submitting symptom reports after clicking on a link in the News Feed. The university does not share any information about symptoms back to Facebook.
In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that initial findings shared by Carnegie Mellon correlate with public data about confirmed cases of COVID-19, an important signal that symptom surveys will soon be able to forecast the diseases spread. Facebook will use aggregated data from the university to produce interactive maps based on symptom surveys and will update them daily.
Ive always believed that helping people come together as a community will help us address our greatest challenges not just by sharing our experiences and supporting each other in crises but also by working together at scale to solve problems, Zuckerberg wrote. The world has faced pandemics before, but this time we have a new superpower: the ability to gather and share data for good. If we use it responsibly, Im optimistic that data can help the world respond to this health crisis and get us started on the road to recovery.
Facebook also announced a partnership with the University of Maryland to begin collecting symptom data globally. If Facebook users report symptoms in their own countries at rates similar to their participation in the United States, the data could prove to be an effective map of potential hotspots around the globe, said Ryan Tibshirani, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who is helping to lead the schools partnership with Facebook.
In an interview with The Verge, Zuckerberg said that global maps could serve as a reality check in places where elected officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of COVID-19 within their borders.
Some of these governments, frankly, are not excited about the world knowing how many actual cases there might be, or indicators of how its spreading in their countries, Zuckerberg said. So getting that data out there is very important.
As the pandemic has spread around the world, Zuckerberg has sought to demonstrate how Facebooks massive global reach can be used to help elected leaders and public health officials make more informed decisions about their pandemic response. Last month, Facebook began inserting a COVID-19 Information Center into the News Feed, showing users vetted information from public health authorities. More than 350 million people have used the center to date, Zuckerberg said.
The moves come as Facebook remains under scrutiny for its practices related to competition, data privacy, and allowing the spread of misinformation. The company is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of states attorney general over antitrust and privacy issues.
As the pandemic worsens, Facebook has worked to show how aggregated, anonymized data collected at global scale can be a force for good. Earlier this month the company also released mobility maps that use smartphone location to illustrate the degree to which Americans are complying with state stay-at-home orders. (Google has released a similar tool using its own location data.)
At the same time, the company has come under continued criticism for its role in spreading misinformation related to the coronavirus, and more recently for its use in organizing protests against stay-at-home orders. On some level, Facebooks corporate initiatives to reduce the harms generated by the pandemic are undermined by the behavior of its user base and at this point its unclear which of those will prove more consequential in the end. 
In a separate announcement on Monday, Facebook announced additional partnerships with researchers to use machine learning techniques to do additional forecasting. In New York, the company is working with New York University and Cornell University to create forecasts for the spread of the disease at the county level, as well as predictions for how a rise in cases will affect demand for services, ventilators, and personal protective equipment at area hospitals. One approach will use machine learning technology from Facebook to analyze de-identified X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) scans in an effort to predict patient outcomes and equipment demand.
Zuckerberg said that while Facebook would not seek to interpret the symptom data it shares with researchers, its size has enabled it to make a significant contribution to the public health response. 
What we can do is help them get a survey out to a large number of people quickly, and on a daily basis, he said. Since we have a basic understanding of who people are, we can make sure that its sampled properly. Were in a relatively unique position where I dont think that there are that many institutions in the world that could stand up a survey like this across the country, much less across the world."

President Trump has suggested that the coronavirus outbreak will be gone by April because the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus, as reported by USA Today. He has appointed Vice President Pence to take charge of the U.S. response to the disease.
But, will the coronavirus be responsive to seasonal changes similar to the flu?
In short, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the spread of the disease will abate with warmer weather. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) notes that at this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.
COVID-19 is different from the virus strains that cause the flu even though it can lead to similar symptoms of respiratory problems. 
So, to glean some insights, we need to look backwards to comparable outbreaks.
The SARS epidemic, which spread in 2002 across Asia, started in November and continued into July. The outbreak was contained comparatively quickly only 8,000 people worldwide were infected. 
MERS began in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, a country with relatively higher temperatures. We dont see too much evidence of seasonality in MERS, Stuart Weston, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told National Geographic.
The CDC says it is is simply too soon to know how COVID-19 will react when it first encounters warmer springtime temperatures."

Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)A dispiriting couple of weeks in the lives of music fans have now climaxed with the death of Bill Withers, whose lean, leathery-tough vocals on such pop classics as ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" ""Use Me,"" ""Just the Two of Us"" and ""Lean on Me"" were deeply woven into the soundtracks of several generations' lives. 
Withers died Monday at 81 of what his family has described as ""heart complications."" His death has not been linked to the Covid-19 virus. But his loss, coming at about the same time that ""Lean on Me"" has resurfaced as a global anthem of collective will during the coronavirus pandemic, nonetheless feels like another in an already seemingly relentless series of recent body blows to the music world. 
Among the casualties: Adam Schlesinger, Fountains of Wayne founding member, lead vocalist and songwriter; Joe Diffie, Grammy-winning country-music singer; Alan Merrill, best known for writing Joan Jett's 1980s anthem, ""I Love Rock and Roll;"" Manu Dibango, a Cameroon saxophonist whose riffs on the hit 1972 dance tune, ""Soul Makossa,"" helped spearhead worldwide interest in African pop; and Aurlus Mabelle, the Congolese song-and-dance man dubbed king of the eclectic blend of black pop genres known as ""soukous."" 
Of all music genres, however, it is jazz that's been struck especially hard and deep by Covid-19. Four musicians of varied ages have died in the last few weeks from the disease, the most recent of which are Ellis Marsalis and Bucky Pizzarelli, two master instrumentalists who found widespread fame relatively late in their storied careers and also passed their legacies on to their children. 
Marsalis, who was 85, was a fixture in his native New Orleans as a pianist doggedly advancing the cause of bop and other post-1940s jazz music in a city more inclined to embrace the pre-swing era of the 1920s. Over time, Marsalis' commitment, chops and reputation as a music educator won him respect and affection from the musical cognoscenti of his hometown. 
Of Marsalis' many prominent students, including Terrence Blanchard and Harry Connick Jr., the most celebrated were four of his six sons. The achievements of Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis were considerable enough to transform the Marsalises into the unofficial royal family of jazz. Along with their dad, they also were staunch and at times acerbic defenders of jazz tradition which by the time Branford and Wynton became breakout stars in the early 1980s, also encompassed the kind of hard bop music their father continued to play into his 70s and 80s. 
Bucky Pizzarelli, who died at 94, was a buoyantly lyrical guitarist who spent most of his early career as a session musician working in recording studios and with such bands as Benny Goodman's and the Tonight Show's NBC Orchestra. He became a fixture in New York nightclubs, playing in several small ensembles with such musicians as saxophonists Zoot Sims and Bud Freeman and violinists Joe Venuti and Stephane Grappelli. 
Most noteworthy of these professional affiliations was the one he shared with his son John, whose performances with his father, beginning in 1980 when John was 20, were also a kind of apprenticeship, enabling eventual renown in his own right as a guitarist and singer. Indeed, John Pizzarelli's fame reached the point that his dad proudly and happily played a supporting role in his son's own high-profile gigs. 
What made the deaths of these two father figures in jazz especially poignant was that they continued to play, teach and inspire deep into their senior years with the possibility of having even more to contribute to the music through the growth of their students.
Pianist Mike Longo, whose coronavirus-related death at 83 came March 22, was, along with Marsalis, a pianist and educator of comparable gifts and influence. His glittering resumé, including providing backup to saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and singer Nancy Wilson (among others), is dominated by his longtime association with trumpet great Dizzy Gillespie, who tapped him to be his musical director and arranger in 1966 and continued to work with him, formally and informally, until Gillespie's death in 1992. 
Besides his work as a writer, arranger and teacher, Longo directed the New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble, which he founded in 1998. He continued to perform music until almost the end of his life. 
Wallace Roney's death this past week at 59, hit the global jazz family especially hard because it came as he was building upon an already formidable reputation as a trumpeter, bandleader and composer. Along with Marsalis' two elder sons, Branford and Wynton, Roney was considered a prominent member of the so-called ""young lions"" at or near their 20s in the 1980s who were out to retrieve acoustic jazz music's once prominent place in the American mainstream. 
With his smoky blue tone, slippery timing and cagey dynamics, Roney was perceived at the outset as little more than a Miles Davis clone. Indeed, the usually truculent Davis enthusiastically declared Roney his protégé. Those listening closer, however, would hear other influences, from Clark Terry to Freddie Hubbard, filtering through Roney's playing. Over decades, Roney's voice would achieve a gritty agility and pensive romanticism that belonged to him and him alone. His intelligent and at times startling negotiations between jazz's past and present implied a future of greater glories -- now shockingly, painfully made inaccessible by pandemic. 
No one knows how long this coronavirus siege will last, or who else we may lose. But one can hope that the spaces left open by these musicians' deaths will be occupied over time not only with fresh new voices, but with a wider, deeper appreciation of how jazz nurtures and nourishes many lives at once -- maybe even your own, if you let it."

Some of his ominous predictions are now playing out as the deadly coronavirus spreads around the globe. The virus causes a disease known as COVID-19, which has killed almost 2,900 people and infected more than 83,000 others globally since December.
""In the past week, COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been worried about,"" Gates wrote in a new op-ed for the New England Journal of Medicine. ""I hope it's not that bad, but we should should assume it will be until we know otherwise.""
Gates referred to the outbreak as a pandemic, even though the World Health Organization has not yet made that declaration. The group has said instead that the virus has ""pandemic potential.""
""In any crisis, leaders have two equally important responsibilities: solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again,"" Gates wrote. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. We need to save lives.""
In the op-ed, Gates suggested the following list of solutions that could help slow the virus' spread:
<ul><li>Wealthy countries should supply low- and middle-income countries in Africa and southern Asia with trained healthcare workers to monitor the virus' spread and deliver vaccines. </li><li>Establish an international database where countries can share information.</li><li>Develop a system that screens for compounds that have already been safety-tested to use in a potential vaccine.</li><li>Governments and donors should fund manufacturing facilities that can pump out vaccines within weeks. </li></ul>Gates compared COVID-19 to the 1957 flu pandemic, which killed more than 1 million people, and the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people. The current outbreak, he wrote, is somewhere in-between. 
Gates predicted that large-scale trials for a coronavirus vaccine could happen as early as June. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's infectious-disease center, recently said that he hopes to start testing vaccine candidates in people by mid-April.
Associated Press
However, drug development is typically a multiyear process that can cost roughly $1 billion in the US. Gates said making vaccines affordable for everyone is the ""right strategy"" for containing the coronavirus outbreak.
""Given the economic pain that an epidemic can impose — we're already seeing how COVID-19 can disrupt supply chains and stock markets, not to mention people's lives — it will be a bargain,"" he wrote.
On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to promise that a future coronavirus vaccine would be affordable for all Americans. But he backtracked day later, saying that any vaccine developed in conjunction with the US government would need to be financially accessible to the public. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already contributed $100 million toward the fight to contain the outbreak. In his op-ed, Gates said warding off a pandemic will require billions of dollars. 
""There is no time to waste,"" he wrote.
Although China has seen a drop-off in its rate of new cases in recent days, the coronavirus has spread to at least 55 other countries. At least 72 people have died outside of mainland China.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Microsoft has launched a new interactive Bing map to provide information on the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The map shows the amount of cases on a per country basis, broken down by the number of currently active cases, recovered cases, and fatal cases. In the US, meanwhile, you can view information state-by-state. Selecting individual countries or states will provide links to relevant news stories and videos. Unfortunately, the stories being promoted arent always the most timely or useful to understand the current state of the evolving pandemic.
Microsoft says the tool is pulling data from a collection of sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and Wikipedia. The tool itself doesnt say how frequently its numbers are being updated, but at the time of publication we found the data to have been updated in the last hour.
In the UK, the tool surfaced an old video which claimed there were no cases in the country.
Image: Bing
Although the case numbers the tool is pulling are consistent with those published by the WHO, Microsofts COVID-19 tracker appears to be having trouble surfacing relevant news stories. When we tried to check news stories that were relevant to the outbreak in the UK, for example, one of the reports it surfaced was about a series of home improvement stores closing in France and Spain. Even more strangely, the lead video was an old news segment from January 24th with the title No confirmed cases of coronavirus yet in the United Kingdom, despite the tracker listing 1,391 cases in the country.
Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, the most recent article on the Dutch map (when viewed from The Netherlands) is two weeks old, despite the fact that the countrys government took the major decision to shut down public places including restaurants and schools just yesterday.
Microsoft isnt the only tech giant which is looking to provide information resources amidst the pandemic. Google has said it will launch a website late Monday with information about the outbreak, including how to prevent its spread and links to local resources. It is also providing information on the novel coronavirus on its homepage, and via YouTube and Maps. The company is also launching a limited coronavirus screening website, which is currently only available to people in the Bay Area of California, in contrast to the nationwide service that the US government suggested it was building on Friday."

Amazon Alexa users in the US can now use the voice assistant as a first step towards diagnosing cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Amazon has announced. Queries such as Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus? or Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19? will prompt the voice assistant to ask about your symptoms, travel history, and possible exposure to the virus. It will then offer advice based on official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information.
The functionality is a step up from the information Alexa was offering previously. Earlier this month, Vox reported that Alexa would list off simple facts. Amazons announcement follows a similar move from Apple, whose Siri voice assistant has also been updated to offer diagnosis advice.
Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?
As well as offering advice on symptoms, Alexa can now also be asked to sing a song for 20 seconds to help you know when youve properly washed your hands. Alexas subpar singing voice means we cant see people using the feature much for themselves, but it might motivate children. Amazon says the feature is available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, the UK, and the US. CNET reports that Google has also added a similar hand-washing timer to its voice assistant.
More generally, Amazon has also kept its fulfillment centers running, which has helped populations to follow shelter-at-home mandates. However, in some cases concerns have been raised about how its gone about this. Workers in the companys warehouses, which are still operating to fulfill orders, including the delivery of COVID-19 test kits in the UK, have reported that management hasnt been proactively informing them when colleagues have tested positive for the disease. Instead, theyve often been hearing about them through rumors. Amazon has also been criticized for not providing enough cleaning supplies in its warehouses, despite assuring workers that it has ramped up its cleaning procedures."

The ghost of Theranos is still haunting the biotech industry, even in the middle of a pandemic. A shell company called Labrador Diagnostics LLC, which says it holds the rights to two Theranos patents, sued a company making COVID-19 tests for patent infringement. The lawsuit asked the court to force the company, BioFire, to stop making its tests. 
This could be the most tone-deaf IP suit in history, tweeted Mark Lemley, director of the Stanford Law School Program in Law, Science and Technology.

 Mark Lemley (@marklemley) March 16, 2020
The shell company is owned by Fortress Investment Group, which bought the Theranos patents in 2018. Fortress Investment Group happens to be backed by SoftBank, which said this fall that it would spend billions to bail out WeWork before backpedaling on that deal this week. 
Soon after TechDirt reported on the lawsuit, though, Labrador Diagnostics LLC said that it would allow third parties to use its patented technology to develop COVID-19 tests though its unclear how valid its claims would have been. Labrador wants to make clear that the lawsuit was not directed to testing for COVID-19. The lawsuit focuses on activities over the past six years that are not in any way related to COVID-19 testing, the company wrote in a press release. 
This isnt the only unscrupulous legal action taken against people trying to fight back the novel coronavirus pandemic. Two Italian startup employees used their 3D printer to make valves for ventilators used to treat COVID-19 patients in a hard-hit Italian hospital, and the medical device company that normally sells the valves for $11,000 threatened to sue them. 
Over 200,000 people have been sickened with COVID-19 worldwide, and over 8,000 people have died. Italy has the highest number of confirmed infections outside of China, and the US has struggled to ramp up testing to meet the increasing demand.

Grocery delivery company Instacart says it will provide its full-service shoppers with health and safety kits days after some workers walked out over a lack of protection during the COVID-19 health crisis. The kits, which workers can request through an Instacart website starting next week, will contain a reusable cloth face mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer. Face masks will also be provided to in-store shoppers at certain retail locations, according to the company. 
Providing protective equipment like face masks has been a key demand of Instacarts workers, who say it could prevent them from getting sick, or else becoming carriers of the virus. Shoppers previously threatened to walk out over the demands, although Instacart later claimed that it suffered no impact as a result of the strike. 
Gig Workers Collective wants more assurances on sick pay
The provisions come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to advise all Americans to start wearing face masks in public. Its a big shift from its previous guidance, which said that only sick people and medical workers should be using them. Now, however, there are concerns that people without symptoms may be carrying the virus, and that asking everyone to wear masks may help prevent infections.
Responding to the latest announcement, Gig Workers Collective called the safety kits a step in the right direction, but expressed concerns about how many kits are available, and how long it might take shoppers to receive them. In a blog post, the group noted that when hand sanitizer was offered on Instacarts internal online store for Shoppers it had immediately sold out. Instacart had previously promised to distribute independently-developed hand sanitizer to its workers.
Gig Workers Collective also expressed concerns that Instacarts measures still dont go far enough to protect vulnerable workers during the pandemic. In particular, it reiterated its demand for a hazard payment of $5 per order to cover the risks associated with working for the company, and for the default in-app tip amount to be set to at least 10 percent. 
It also demanded that workers with preexisting conditions who are more at risk from the virus be provided with sick pay if they have to stay home, and for sick leave to be made more accessible. Previously, Instacart has promised to offer up to 14 days paid sick leave for workers ill or quarantining as a result of COVID-19, but organizers said these measures didnt go far enough. Concerns were raised that a requirement to test positive for COVID-19 is of limited use when tests are in short supply and wouldnt help workers without health insurance.
Delivery services like Instacart have seen a huge spike in demand as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as people obey social distancing guidelines by sheltering at home. CNN reportsthat Instacart plans to hire an additional 300,000 independent contractors as a result of increased demand."

Amazon has decided to shut down all of its fulfillment centers in France after a French court ruled the company could be fined 1 million per item for shipping anything not directly related to medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. The company, which plans to appeal the ruling, says that at the moment the risk [is] too high that it will run afoul of the ruling due to complexities in its warehouse operations. The shutdown will last from at least April 16th to April 20th. Reuters originally published the news on Wednesday morning. 
Following the judgement of a French court on Tuesday, we have to temporarily suspend operations in our Fulfilment Centres in France. This is in spite of the huge investment we made in additional safety measures to keep our hard-working, dedicated colleagues safe, while ensuring they had continued employment at this difficult time, an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge in statement. Our FC operations are complex and varied, and with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high. We remain perplexed by the courts decision, which was made in spite of the overwhelming evidence we provided about the safety measures we have implemented, and have launched an appeal. 
with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high
Amazon has come under fire both in the US and overseas for its handling of health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis has only made the e-commerce giants services more vital as people shelter at home and rely more on online ordering and delivery of household goods, food, and other items. But more than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the Financial Times, and the company is now building its own testing lab to try to keep its operations running amid panic surrounding the viruss rapid spread through its warehouses. 
Throughout the crisis, Amazon has been criticized by workers, activists, and politicians for not properly communicating to warehouse workers when a co-worker has been diagnosed with the illness and for not taking enough precautionary measures to prevent the illness from spreading by closing down facilities and deep cleaning them. In some cases, Amazon workers say they only hear about a COVID-19 diagnosis from co-workers, and in Kentucky, the governor ordered Amazon to keep its returns facility closed after numerous confirmed cases among the workforce. 
In one particularly high-profile controversy, Amazon also fired a warehouse worker in New York City who organized a protest against the companys handling of health and safety issues related to COVID-19. The situation, in which Amazon claimed the worker violated the companys self-isolation guidelines to attend the protest, drew the attention of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and accusations of retaliation. It was later discovered Amazon executives internally planned how to smear the organizer in the media. 
In France, the Union Syndicale Solidaires trade union filed complaints pushing for more oversight of Amazons handling of health issues during the pandemic and calling for the closure of facilities due to overcrowding. Amazon now says it is asking its fulfillment center workers to stay home. Amazon employs about 10,000 people in warehouses in France, according to Reuters.
In the mean-time, we are working through what this courts decision means for them and our French operation, the statement reads. While we will do our best to minimize the impact on French small businesses, those who depend on our FC network to deliver their products will be negatively impacted by this ruling.
Amazon says it will continue to serve French customers using its Marketplace sellers and robust global fulfillment network.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has been much deadlier in older people but more anecdotes are popping up of young, healthy people getting critically ill and even dying of the disease.
What do these cases tell us about the disease?
Two 29-year-old health care workers became seriously ill in Wuhan only one survived, a report in The New York Times detailed. Other stories about people under 50 coming down with serious symptoms are making the rounds on social media, along with questions about whether seemingly healthy young people ought to be more concerned. What do these cases tell us about the disease?
A dear friend in Madrid is in a coma with Covid-19. Hes under 40 and was in excellent condition. So much for it only killing the old and infirm. Why are NYC bars and restaurants still open?
 James B. Stewart (@JamesStewartNYT) March 15, 2020
There are reasons for people in every age group to be cautious, health experts say, but not because our understanding of who is most vulnerable to the virus is changing. Just because older people are more likely to develop a severe case or die from the disease, it doesnt mean some young people wont. That smaller number of severe cases among young people still doesnt disprove the data that shows that seniors are the most vulnerable.
The US will likely see more young people get really sick over the next several weeks simply because the pandemic is still growing. Days can pass before someone starts feeling the symptoms of COVID-19. So experts anticipate a jump in the number of cases in the US as those who have been in incubation periods start feeling ill and more people get tested for the virus.
I think its almost a math problem in some ways, right? says Benjamin Singer, an assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Even with a lower likelihood of younger people getting critically ill, a certain percentage will get critically ill, and since the denominator is growing and growing these cases are popping up more and more.
Underlying health conditions can also make younger people susceptible to a severe case of the virus. Where you find severe cases or even death in young people, we dont really have full information on these patients, says Lee Riley, chair of the division of infectious disease and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Its possible that some of those people might have had medical conditions that we just didnt know about. Chronic conditions that can affect young people, like diabetes, can make it more difficult for someone to recover from the disease.
We cant do this without the young people cooperating.
Even younger people who feel perfectly healthy need to take the pandemic seriously because they can spread the virus even if theyre not feeling any symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. Dont get the attitude, Well, Im young, Im invulnerable. Fauci said at a press briefing today. You dont want to put your loved ones at risk, particularly the ones who are elderly and the ones who have compromised conditions. We cant do this without the young people cooperating. Please cooperate with us.

Electric scooters are vanishing from more cities as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to roil shared mobility services across the world. Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world, said it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries. Bird said it would halt operations in six US cities as well as all of its European markets. And Spin, which is owned by Ford, has had to pause service in very few cities and universities.
The decisions to suspend service reflect the rapidly changing environment in the US and around the world in response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Just three days ago, Lime was the only scooter company to halt operations in two US states and three European countries. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts
Now, with shelter-in-place orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home, scooter companies are likely seeing a steep drop in demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a challenge for the money-losing scooter business, that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm. 
Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts. The company said it was winding down or pausing service in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. 
The companys scooters remain available in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Brisbane, Australia; Busan, South Korea; Christchurch, New Zealand; Dunedin, New Zealand; Hamilton, New Zealand; Selwyn District, New Zealand; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia. 
Bird said it is pausing service in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Portland, Miami, and Coral Gables. The company has also pulled its scooters from all of its European markets, which includes Annecy, Antwerp, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Krakow, Lisbon, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, Paris, Rimini, Sevilla, Stockholm, Torino, Verona, and Vienna.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale.
The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale. Given our deep understanding of and empathy towards the cities, communities and people we serve, we are temporarily pausing our service in a variety of cities, a spokesperson said. This is very fluid as the response to COVID-19 evolves and is in line with voluntary, as well as mandatory measures set by local governments for businesses.
In contrast, Spin says it has been asked to step up by some cities to help fill transportation gaps after the public bus system was shut down. The Ford-owned company says it was designated as an essential service during the citys shelter-in-place order and encouraged to continue operations as a healthy mobility option. Still, Spin said it has also paused operations in very few markets, either because a city requested it or because a university campus has been shut down. (A spokesperson didnt specify which cities it had paused service.)
For the remaining scooters still available to rent, all of the companies say they have stepped up their sanitizing efforts and instituted new workplace protocols for employees to ensure social distancing in the warehouses that are still opened. 
Lyft is still offering scooters to rent in San Francisco, but it halted operations in Miami at the request of the city. Jump, which is owned by Uber, didnt respond to requests for comment. According to Streetsblog, Jump has only paused scooter operations in Sacramento, California. Last month, Lyft said in a regulatory filing that the outbreak in China has led to production delays of certain automotive parts and components of bikes and scooters.
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic
Scooter-sharing isnt the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic. Public transportation ridership has cratered and fare revenue has practically dried up. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also seeing precipitous drops in gross bookings in cities hit hard by the disease. Three weeks of social distancing and warnings to stay at home have taken a huge bite out of the total number of trips taken with all modes of transportation. 
But as people avoid transit and shared modes of travel, the silver lining seems to be the number of personal mobility trips that are rising. In New York City, for instance, cycling traffic on the East River bridges is up over 50 percent and Citi Bike ridership is up almost 70 percent compared to this time last year. But city officials arent doing enough to protect those riders who are switching to bikes; cyclist injuries were up 43 percent between March 9th and March 15th, according to NYPD statistics obtained by Streetsblog. 
Cities have a unique opportunity during the pandemic to remake their streets to better prioritize these low-carbon forms of transportation. While staying at home and following government recommendations for social distancing is the first order of priorities, if you have to take a trip and do not want to ride public transport, or if public transport has reduced service, the bicycle can be a good alternative, Virginia Tech transportation expert Ralph Buehler said in an email."

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs philanthropic arm, has committed $25 million to a research fund designed to help identify and develop treatments for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, it announced today.
CZI, managed by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, is donating to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which will help coordinate research efforts to identify new drugs and treatments for the illness. The Accelerator is already backed by $125 million in commitments from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, health foundation Wellcome, and Mastercards Impact Fund, according a March 10th press release.
The Gates Foundation has committed up to $50 million
CZI says it will provide $20 million to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator and make another $5 million available based on future needs. The Gates Foundation and Wellcome each have committed up to $50 million, while Mastercards Impact Fund has committed up to $25 million. 
The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, organizations in both the public and private sectors, and global regulatory and policy-setting institutions to coordinate research efforts, according to the release.
Were excited to partner with the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard to help the biomedical research community quickly identify, develop, and test treatments for COVID-19, said Chan and Zuckerberg in a statement. The Therapeutics Accelerator will enable researchers to quickly determine whether or not existing drugs have a potential benefit against COVID-19. We hope these coordinated efforts will help stop the spread of COVID-19 as well as provide shared, reusable strategies to respond to future pandemics.
CZI and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which researches ways to cure and manage diseases, have already been working to help increase the number of COVID-19 tests in the San Francisco Bay Area. CZI said last week it is aiming to help the University of California, San Francisco support at least 1,000 tests per day in the coming days.
The Gates Foundation is also working to increase testing, partnering with the University of Washington to offer at-home COVID-19 testing kits for people in the Seattle area. However, its not clear when that program will begin. The Gates Foundations commitment to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator comes in part from its up to $100 million commitment to COVID-19 response announced on February 5th.

Fact-checking organization Snopes has been forced to scale back its routine content production and special projects, as the amount of misinformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed its fact-checkers. 
In a blog post that was later published as a series of tweets, the organization said the pandemic is overwhelming its small team and that it cant ask them to ramp up productivity at a time when everyones personal lives are being placed under such strain. Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive, the organization wrote, but exhausting our staff in this crisis is not the cure for what is ailing our industry. Going forward, it said it intends to focus its efforts only where we think we can have a significant impact.
Yes, publishing less may seem counterintuitive
Snopes isnt the only organization struggling to handle the amount of misinformation thats being spread about the novel coronavirus pandemic. Facebook, which until last year had partnered with Snopes to combat misinformation, pledged to remove coronavirus misinformation, only for a software bug to start marking legitimate news articles as spam. Twitter, meanwhile, has been inconsistent in its approach. It removed misinformation posted by several high-profile accounts but later refused to remove a misleading tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
In its announcement, Snopes offered some advice on how people could help to combat the spread of misinformation. It directed people toward official information sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) and asked people to support local news publications and businesses. It also called for people to support Snopes directly with donations and to lobby big tech platforms to do more to combat misinformation themselves.
As well as scaling back production on its regular content, Snopes says that its offering all of its employees a $750 cash bonus to help with any costs they may be facing, and it has said it will offer paid time off for people as they look after themselves and their families.
In the meantime, if youd like to check out the COVID-19 fact-checking Snopes has already done, you can do so here."

Growing public concern over the coronavirus prompted the annual San Francisco trade show's organizers to pull the plug ahead of their March 16 start date. In a statement released Friday night, GDC organizers said that they would ""postpone"" the gathering until ""later in the summer.""
The decision came on the heels of numerous pullouts, as major companies like Microsoft, Sony, Epic Games, Facebook, and Amazon (among many others) confirmed in recent weeks that they'd be bowing out. The new coronavirus, which is formally known as COVID-19, hasn't infected huge numbers in the United States yet, but there are signs that that's changing. (The CDC already said it's ""inevitable."")
The GDC email notes that passholders who were planning to attend will be getting a separate email about ""next steps"" regarding refunds, which will be given ""in full."" Separately, some as-yet-unknown number of planned presentations from the show will be made available online for free. The organizers are also looking into getting guest speakers to submit video versions of their planned talks.
Unlike E3, the annual GDC trade show is built more around digging deep on the actual practice of making games. Talks and workshops explore the various disciplines that are tied to game development and publishing. There's also a big piece of the show that's geared around recruitment and hiring.
Even though it's more of an industry-focused event, GDC is still often a place where publishers and studios of all sizes come to reveal what they're working on. Mid-March may still bring an onslaught of such news, but it won't be against the backdrop of a bustling trade show.
SEE ALSO: Worried about coronavirus? Stop touching your face.
As of now, GDC organizers haven't said anything more specific about the timing or makeup of a possible summer version of the show. Like many things tied to this new coronavirus, a lot of those decisions will probably hinge significantly on how the illness continues to spread and whether or not the arrival of spring and the formal end of cold and flu season slows it down.
The full text of the GDC statement follows:
After close consultation with our partners in the game development industry and community around the world, weve made the difficult decision to postpone the Game Developers Conference this March.
Having spent the past year preparing for the show with our advisory boards, speakers, exhibitors, and event partners, we're genuinely upset and disappointed not to be able to host you at this time.
We want to thank all our customers and partners for their support, open discussions and encouragement. As everyone has been reminding us, great things happen when the community comes together and connects at GDC. For this reason, we fully intend to host a GDC event later in the summer. We will be working with our partners to finalize the details and will share more information about our plans in the coming weeks.

It's 2020 and yes, full grown adults still need to hear it. 
Health officials in Washington confirmed the first death from the new coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, on Saturday. The virus is highly contagious, and as of Saturday, has infected 85,641 people worldwide and is responsible for 2,933 deaths. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
As panic around the virus rises, preventative supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer are becoming increasingly difficult to buy. They're out of stock in most drugstores and big box stores like Walmart and Target. On Amazon, brands like Purell and Germ-X are only available through third party sellers at high mark-ups. Frustratedshoppers on social media warned others of the hand sanitizer shortage, crowdsourcing lists of stores that still had an inventory. 
But hand sanitizer and face masks can only do so much compared to just washing your fucking hands. 
To prevent the spread of the novel virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and washing your hands. The CDC, in fact, ""does not recommend that people who are well"" even bother with wearing face masks as protection from respiratory diseases like the coronavirus.
While sanitizing with alcohol-based gels like Purell and Germ-X can reduce the number of microbes on your hands, they're not as effective as decent hand washing. The CDC says that hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol are effective to a degree, but people don't use enough for it to make most microbes inactive. Furthermore, studiesshow that hand sanitizer isn't as effective as hand washing to make germs like C-Diff and norovirus inactive. A 2008 study concluded that hand washing reduces respiratory illnesses by 21 percent. 
And besides, you should be washing your hands regularly regardless of whether or not we're facing a potentially devastating virus outbreak. It's just good practice, no matter what the state of global health is at the moment. 
Others on Twitter echoed a similar sentiment.

 Alex (@dirtbagboyfren) February 29, 2020
Despite emphasizing effective hand washing methods since childhood, Americans are still nasty. It's estimated that 95 percent of people don't wash their hands effectively, if at all, a 2013 study from Michigan State University concluded. The study found that 7 percent of women didn't wash their hands, and of those who did, 79 percent used soap. Another 15 percent of men didn't wash their hands at all, the study found, and only 50 percent of those who did used soap. 
That is disgusting. 
Hand washing shouldn't be and really isn't that hard. Singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice and gently scrubbing under warm, soapy water takes virtually no time and can prevent major disease spread. But it shouldn't take the threat of a potential pandemic to get adults to wash their hands after touching public doors or taking a dump. That should just be a societal expectation! This shouldn't be a public service announcement in the first place! 
Stop being nasty and just wash your hands."

General Motors is partnering with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of ventilators that are needed in hospitals dealing with patients who have the novel coronavirus, the companies announced Friday. In the most severe cases of COVID-19 infection, patients need the assistance of ventilators to breathe, and there are widespread concerns that the US does not have enough ventilators to meet the coming demand.
Seattle-based Ventec is one of a handful of ventilator manufacturers in the US, according to NBC News, and already has ramped up its production. Ventec CEO Chris Kiple says the company is aiming to produce 1,000 machines per month (up from its usual 150 per month), in the next 90 days, and eventually, to produce 2,000 ventilators per month. 
Ventec will rely on GMs manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing to help build more ventilators more quickly. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that GM would continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis. 
Other automakers including Ford and Volkswagen also reportedly have contacted the White House to see how they could help with ventilator production. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla and SpaceX employees were working on ventilators and despite a tweet from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that the machines were definitely needed, Musk didnt provide further details about when or where his companies would produce the machines.

People in the US are worried about the new coronavirus outbreak. That concern is warranted: the virus is a scary new threat, it can cause serious harm, and there arent any medications that can stop it. Thats not to mention the cancellations of schools, popular events, and the general disruption to peoples lives its causing.
But fear, and the things people do when theyre afraid, changes and drives the societal impact of the virus. Viruses cant function on their own: they require a host, a person, in order to survive and reproduce. That person makes choices and behaves in certain ways. When that persons behaviors are driven by fear, it can lead to discrimination and decision-making out of line with public health recommendations which can make the outbreak even worse.
Thats the major common thread connecting outbreaks from the Black Death to the current novel coronavirus outbreak: fear and panic can magnify the harm done by a virus. People can get worked up and do bad things in response, says Philip Alcabes, professor of public health at Hunter College and author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to Avian Flu. 
In the US, panic over rising case counts has triggered a rush on grocery stores and pharmacies. In New York City, for example, theres hardly a bottle of hand sanitizer to be found, and pasta and beans are in short supply. Its good to prepare for disruption to everyday life, but theres a difference between preparedness and panic buying and the later can cause shortages. 
More troublingly, people in the US and around the world have also been buying up supplies of surgical masks and respirators, despite pleas from experts not to. Masks may offer some people comfort, but they dont provide much protection against illness if theyre not used properly (and laypeople usually dont use them properly). When theyre squirreled away in peoples homes, theyre not available for health care workers who actually need them and know how to use them. 
The World Health Organization says that there are worldwide shortages of masks and other protective equipment, and that puts health care workers at risk. Thats a problem for everyone, and it can exacerbate outbreaks. If health care workers, who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients, get sick in high numbers because they dont have proper protection, it adds to the caseload for hospitals. It also leaves fewer nurses and doctors to treat patients. 
Panic also unearths racism and discrimination. The novel coronavirus originated in China, and when it started to spread, anti-Asian racism took off around the world. The same thing happened during the SARS outbreak in 2002. Its an old story, Alcabes says. When the Black Death first came to Europe, there were rumors in Switzerland that a Jewish guy had a secret recipe for poison and was putting it in drinking wells, he says. It caused a series of really dreadful attacks on Jewish communities. The fear doesnt create prejudice; it just reveals it. It allows it to manifest. And it can do so in ways that can be really harmful to people, he says.
Also harmful are rumors and misinformation, which can spread quickly during epidemic outbreaks. They had devastating effects during the 20142015 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa: people kept sick relatives home because they were afraid of treatment centers. When they tried to care for them without proper equipment, they quickly became ill themselves. That let the disease spread among families, which made the outbreak harder to contain.
At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, false theories that the virus was a bioweapon developed by the Chinese government or by Bill Gates spread online and were repeated by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). A right-wing blog doxxed the Chinese scientist it accused of creating the weapon. In Iran, fake letters from health officials spread on social media, and bad information on the best ways to prevent infection from the virus circulated online. An email hoax led to protests in Ukraine that turned violent.
People often turn to misinformation out of fear and when they cant access or dont trust information from experts or public health officials, Rob Blair, assistant professor of political science and international and public affairs at Brown University, told The Verge. Believing misinformation can then create distrust in experts. That cycle may lead people to disregard public health advice and continue to, for example, buy and hoard masks or to ignore recommendations around isolation and quarantine. 
In the US, the spread of misinformation around the novel coronavirus has been facilitated by President Trump who has contradicted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by claiming, incorrectly, that vaccines would be available soon, that testing was widely available, and that people with symptoms of COVID-19 can go to work. The mismatch in messaging between the CDC and the president can make it hard for people to know what to trust and believe. That confusion can create and exacerbate panic.
After the Ebola outbreaks, experts wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that public health officials and authorities need to grapple with fear in their response to future outbreaks. Fear-related behaviors have the potential to accelerate the spread of a disease, they wrote.
During a disease outbreak, anxiety and worry are reasonable reactions, and its important to take precautions to reduce the spread of disease. People should wash their hands, stay home if theyre sick, and keep away from crowds; officials should consider rescheduling or canceling mass gatherings all expert-recommended and evidence-based strategies that can blunt the worst societal side effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. But striving to avoid acting out of fear and pushing public officials to communicate in ways that help limit it can help make sure those strategies have the greatest possible effect.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted the news as part of an update on Facebook’s COVID-19 pandemic response, where he also said the “vast majority” of Facebook employees would work from home until at least the end of next month. The cancellations include the Oculus Connect 7 virtual reality conference in San Jose, which is being replaced by an online-only event. “We will require the vast majority of our employees to work from home through at least the end of May in order to create a safer environment both for our employees doing critical jobs who must be in the office and for everyone else in our local communities,” writes Zuckerberg. Some employees, including moderators who cover terrorism and self-harm-related content, can’t work remotely. But “overall, we don’t expect to have everyone back in our offices for some time.” As we start to think about what it will look like to re-open society, I wanted to provide an update on how we're... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, April 16, 2020 Zuckerberg notes that health experts don’t know when large gatherings will be advisable again, so Facebook is preemptively canceling physical events for the next year. That covers not only Oculus Connect but probably also the company’s main F8 conference, which is typically held in the spring. To make up for the loss in revenue from Oculus Connect 7, Facebook will donate $500,000 to the city of San Jose. Much of Oculus Connect is already streamed online, but the show is also a chance for press and developers to check out prototype hardware and new games and apps. Facebook is extending its “no business travel” policy through June 2021 as well, so it’s doubtful it would even ask smaller groups to come see hardware. As for the rest, “we look forward to sharing more details about the digital event in the coming months.” One leak suggests Oculus is working on a new headset codenamed “Del Mar,” and the company could still announce news about it at the show — but with manufacturing supply chains currently in flux, it could be hitting pause on that project, too."

Camera makers Leica and Olympus have announced initiatives to offer free courses and talks for photographers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies that cater to creative fields have opened up resources for those currently stuck at home, and last week Nikon made its entire curriculum of online photography classes free until the end of April.
For its part, Olympus has launched Home With Olympus Sessions to connect people with Olympus technical experts. Photographers can sign up for group or one-on-one sessions to ask specific questions, get feedback, and learn more about their Olympus cameras from home. The group sessions are capped at six people and are themed around particular camera models and types of photography, like landscape, macro, and underwater. Theres limited space so if youre interested, head over to Olympus website to sign up.
Meanwhile, Leica is rolling out a series of free online discussions led by renowned photographers, musicians, actors, and other creatives. The talks will happen over the next few weeks and kick off on April 12th. Photographers Jennifer McClure and Juan Cristóbal Cobo will speak about sustaining their photography while on self-quarantine, Maggie Steber will talk about her Guggenheim-winning project the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma, and Stephen Vanasco will go into his digital workflow. 
Youll need to register on Eventbrite in order to attend the virtual talks. DJ D Nice, Jeff Garlin, and Danny Clinch are also set to give talks in the near future, but registration for those sessions hasnt opened up yet."

Verizon is canceling scheduled appointments for internet installation and repairs, according to some customers and two Verge reporters with persistent internet issues. The decision potentially leaves Fios subscribers without wired internet at a time when theyre likely relying on it for work and to see friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are minimizing our in-home installation work to critical needs to keep our employees and customers safe and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, Verizon says in a support document. 
We are minimizing our in-home installation work to critical needs.
To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our employees and customers safe, we are making every attempt to perform work without going into homes or small businesses and are limiting in-home installs to medical emergencies and critical installations, Verizon tells The Verge in a statement. Self-install options are also available for qualified service orders, the company added.
However, Verizon actually changed the language in the support document sometime on Tuesday morning, according to Business Insider. Previously, the site said that our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services or to do repair work.
Here is the previous language, from a version of the page archived on Monday:
As a result of COVID-19, we are taking precautions to keep our employees and customers safe. At this time, our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services or to do repair work. Qualified orders will be provided self-install options, or you may proceed with placing an order for a technician-required installation and it will be held for future appointment priority. You will receive notification to select an installation date when we resume operations.
Users on Twitter have reported that their installation appointments have been canceled. One said yesterday that his installation appointment was canceled for internet that he needed for school. In a reply, Verizon said its technicians will not be able to enter your home to install new services or do repair work.

Earlier today, Verizon told a customer who said their installation appointment was canceled that qualified orders will be provided self-install options and that he would get future appointment priority if he opted for installation by a technician.

Verizons new policies have also affected reporters here at The Verge. Science reporter Loren Grush hasnt had internet from Verizon since April 1st. A technician came to her apartment that day to investigate, but they said an engineering technician needed to look at the problem and potentially do a repair. The engineering technicians appointment was scheduled for yesterday, but they never showed up. Verizon told Grush there was a new protocol implemented on April 6th that meant technicians could no longer come into her home. 
I tried calling today but essentially was told engineering will call you, Grush said in a Slack message. We have to wait for them to call us, and since this new rule is in place, Im not entirely hopeful.
Im worried once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable.
In the meantime, Grush and her husband have been forced to rely on their mobile hotspots for internet, which they need for their work right now. She says she almost hit her mobile data cap, while her husband had to pay to add a higher data cap. Im worried [that] once we hit the caps, the internet will be unusable, said Grush. 
Makena Kelly, a policy reporter at The Verge, has also been experiencing problems with her Fios internet since April 1st. A technician was scheduled to check on the problem on April 4th, but the internet returned, so Verizon canceled the appointment, she said in a Slack message. The internet went out again later that day, and Kelly hasnt been able to reschedule an appointment.
To help customers fix issues that dont need a technician to visit in person, Verizon tells The Verge that its piloting a virtual assistant tech tool that allows our field technicians to interact with customers via real time, interactive video chat. The company has not responded to questions from The Verge about how big that pilot is or when it might roll out more broadly."

Photo by Avijit Ghosh/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
The COVID-19 pandemic is on the verge of colliding with another public health threat: extreme heat, which kills more people in the US each year than any other weather-related event. Public health officials usually recommend that people without air conditioning head to places like malls and libraries where they can cool off, but thats not an option for a lot of people sheltering at home. 
The problem could soon begin to affect India
The problem could soon begin to affect India, where temperatures begin to climb in April and have reached as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Indias 1.3 billion residents have been ordered to stay indoors until April 14th to stop the spread of disease, and only about 5 percent of the population has air conditioning. 
Heat-related illness can begin with mild symptoms like a headache and muscle cramps, and they can progress to confusion, dizziness, vomiting, and losing consciousness. Once the body reaches a point where it can no longer cool itself down by sweating, heat stroke can lead to organ failure and eventually death. Those most at risk are often the poor and elderly, groups that are similarly hard-hit by the novel coronavirus. Heat-related deaths can be prevented by checking in on people who might be isolated indoors and providing public places for them to get out and cool down. But those strategies contradict efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, which mostly focus on keeping people apart.
Were in between a rock and a hard place if it were to become a heatwave during the time when were enacting physical distancing measures, says David Eisenman, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles department of community health sciences. 
Were in between a rock and a hard place
In developing countries, the migration to cities from rural areas has posed new problems when it comes to preventing deaths from heat. Traditionally built homes in less densely packed areas often included designs that naturally kept the structure cool, like inner courtyards and windows aligned to allow prevailing winds to pass through. But poorer newcomers to cities have packed into informal settlements where homes may be little more than brick or metal walls with a corrugated metal roof. Thats literally an oven, says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance, which partners with governments to plan more heat-resilient cities. Its estimated that 40 percent of the worlds urban expansion takes place in slums, and more than two-thirds of the worlds population is expected to live in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme. 
The problem is way worse in the developing world, but we shouldnt take that and say that were out of the woods here [in the US], Shickman says. The US sees upward of 600 heat-related deaths each year. Heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and more intense because of climate change, took a heavy toll in Europe last year, too, killing almost 1,500 in France last June and July. 
[Extreme heat] is even more of a pressing issue with the pandemic than it was beforehand, and this need for staying at home is only bringing out issues that already existed, says Sonal Jessel, a policy and advocacy coordinator for the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental Justice. Even though New York City has just stepped into spring, Jessel is already scrambling to figure out strategies to keep people safe in case hotter temperatures arrive earlier this year. 
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities
Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities like New York compared to surrounding areas, because all the asphalt and concrete absorb and trap heat. It can be even hotter in industrial neighborhoods with fewer trees and parks, which means some communities are more vulnerable than others. Almost half of all people who lost their lives to heat in New York City between 2000 and 2012 were African American, although theyre just under 25 percent of the citys population.
Now that were all instructed globally not to gather in close proximity, its going to really call for creativity and quick pivoting among public health systems around the world, says Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist at the National Resources Defense Council, who has worked with Jessels organization in New York and other groups in India to prevent heat-related illness and death. She and other public health experts are beginning to put their heads together to figure out how they may need to tackle two crises coming heat waves and the ongoing pandemic in tandem. But they dont have answers just yet.
Cities might have to figure out how to create publicly accessible places where people can cool down while also maintaining enough physical space between each other to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Eisenman at UCLA says. It just seems like a really hard thing to pull off, he says. 
More needs to be done to help people cool down at home
If beating the heat by going to a public place is out of the question, then more needs to be done to help people cool down at home, says Jessel. That means getting air conditioners into more homes, and helping people pay their utility bills so that they dont need to choose between running their air conditioning and paying for other necessities. With lots of people losing their jobs during the pandemic, making air conditioning affordable is even more pressing. Jessels organization is advocating for more funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that provides assistance with home energy bills. Beyond that, Jessel and other advocates are pushing for ways to retrofit homes to keep them cooler. Installing better insulation, painting roofs white to reflect the sun, and planting rooftop gardens can keep homes and buildings cool. 
Temperatures in parts of California, where theres a state-wide shelter-in-place order, are going to rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) next week. While Eisenman doesnt think those numbers will begin to pose a threat just yet, he warns that the first really hot days of the season can be particularly dangerous because people are still adjusting to the change in temperatures. And while California and New York are current hotspots for COVID-19 in the US, he worries that other states with fewer coronavirus cases now but hotter climates, like Arizona, might see their number of cases peak closer to the start of summer. That potential scenario could be deadly, which is why Eisenman and others are encouraging groups to take early measures to address the combination of threats before the case counts and temperatures start to rise.

Image: iFixit
Repair specialist iFixit is building a database filled with repair information for the worlds hospital equipment in anticipation of the increased demand caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In particular, its calling for repair manuals for ventilators and BiPAP machines that can be used as ventilators. iFixits database can be found here, and the company is calling for people to create new device pages and upload photographs and manuals.
The reasoning behind creating the database is simple: as the novel coronavirus spreads, the experience of Italian and Chinese hospitals suggests that the worlds supply of ventilators is going to be placed under huge stress, making it essential that these can be repaired quickly if and when they break down. This equipment will be an essential part of treating anyone who develops respiratory problems as a result of COVID-19.
Once its got the manuals, iFixit wants to make repair guides
There are currently few sources for repair manuals online. iFixit notes that resources like Franks Hospital Workshop exist, but these are relatively small operations. Some manufacturers provide easy access to repair manuals on their websites, but others make them harder to find.
There are a few different parts to iFixits campaign beyond assembling a collection of manuals. Once its got a manual, the company wants to format its information to make it as easy to understand as possible. It plans to break the manuals down into guides for individual repairs, to reformat them to make them more SEO-friendly, and to translate them into other languages.
iFixit also wants to put together preventive maintenance guides so technicians can work to keep their equipment in good working order before it reaches the point of breaking down.
As well as looking for people with access to repair information, iFixit is also asking for the medical community to provide information about which ventilators are currently in use as well as which parts are most likely to break. 
Its an important and timely initiative from a company thats usually associated with helping people fix their personal consumer electronics. If youve got access to any manuals that you think might be helpful for the initiative, you can upload them to iFixit directly or email the company if youve got a batch of manuals that would be too time-consuming to upload manually."

The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted departures from New York and Philadelphia airports after a trainee at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Long Island tested positive for COVID-19 today. The person had not been at the facility since March 17th, and the FAA is sanitizing affected areas. 
As of 2:45 PM ET, the agency had lifted the ground stop order, according to the Associated Press.
That center, which primarily handles high-altitude, cross-country flights, remained open. But the FAA rerouted flights as part of a longstanding contingency plan to ensure continued operations. 
The FAA said in a statement that it is working with local health officials and employee representatives to determine how many personnel might have interacted with the trainee in recent days.
CNBC reported that there have been staffing issues because of coronavirus at FAA facilities around the country; on Wednesday, flights from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas were diverted because an air traffic controller there potentially tested positive for COVID-19.

The problem is that they've not been easily accessible in one searchable database, which means it might take callers or texters reaching out for help longer to find the resources they need. 
A new website launched Tuesday by the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition aims to change that. Its goal is to make mental health support a click away for people who are struggling with their emotional and mental wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The ability to access mental health crisis services is critical at this time, yet COVID-19 is impacting the typical ways people receive help in a crisis,"" Travis Atkinson, president of the Crisis Residential Association and co-chair of the American Association of Suicidologys Crisis Services Committee, said in a statement.  
Atkinson noted that emergency rooms, where patients might seek care for suicidal thinking and behavior or a panic attack, are focused on treating COVID-19 patients. At the same time, psychiatric hospitals are decreasing their capacity in order to follow social distancing guidelines. ""[P]eople need to know how to access available mental health services,"" Atkinson said.
The new site debuted with a database of crisis services searchable by state, contact method, support type, topics, and categories. Someone in New York, for example, could search for text-based services staffed by counselors with experience talking about anxiety. In addition to anxiety, topics include bullying, gambling, parenting, and substance use. There are several categories that focus on demographics like gender, veteran status, age, and sexuality. 
Example of a search on the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition website.

The database includes contact information for hundreds of helplines and community centers, whose volunteers and staff are trained to connect callers with local mental health providers and resources. The site also includes articles on coping with the effects of COVID-19, tips for how to help a loved one, and information specifically for frontline workers who want mental health support. 
The Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition is a group of international mental health organizations that banded together in March in order to create the site. Its members include Crisis Text Line, the American Association of Suicidology, The Trevor Project, and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing emotional distress, you can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline by calling 1-800-985-5990 or texting TalkWithUs to 66746. The helpline, which is operated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, specializes in helping people who are experiencing emotional distress related to any natural or human-caused disaster."

The company is also automatically adding links to providers' COVID-19 information pages on Search and Maps. Google Health’s director of product management Julie Black wrote in a blog post that interest in telehealth and virtual care has risen “dramatically"" since the onset of the pandemic.
Over the last several weeks, Google made government announcements about COVID-19 and travel advisories related to the pandemic more prominent in Search. It also extended free access to premium video chat features in Google Meet through September, including the option to record and save calls.

On Monday, Michael Webber, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, tested positive for antibodies for Covid-19. While it's now been months since CES was held, he'd fallen ill shortly after coming back from the convention in January.
The report goes on to note that he wasn't the only one who felt sick shortly after attending CES. APM Reports spoke to multiple attendees who confirmed they also felt sick after the conference though they're still waiting on results for antibody tests.
Additionally, the report highlights a number of tweets in which people complained about feeling under the weather just days after the conference ended.
At the time, reports of CES-related illness didn't seem like such a big deal, though. After all, CES is known for being hectic at all hours of the day. It's also common to get sick afterwards. Every year people complain about the dreaded ""CES flu.""
People are traveling, attending back-to-back meetings during the day and events at night, walking the floors of a packed convention center, and not sleeping enough. You're also shaking hands with everyone you meet and touching devices that hordes of other people are also touching. It's almost impossible not to get sick. 
But this year, the ""CES flu"" was a little different because people appeared to be suffering from similar symptoms: fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, aches, and pains. You know, everything that comes with having Covid-19. 
Webber told the publication that his ""revelation comes at the same time that public health officials in Northern California, including Silicon Valley, reported three newly confirmed coronavirus deaths."" 
Seeing as how one of those deaths happened in early February, it means the virus might've started spreading in the United States earlier than predicted.
And, according to what's been gathered, the Vegas convention was an ""ideal environment for the virus to spread."" In addition to the United States, there are at least 63 other countries that attend CES each year. 
APM Reports also says a little more than 100 people attended this year's conference from Wuhan, China where the first outbreak was recorded towards the end of 2019. 
But CES organizers told APM Reports there haven't been any confirmed cases of Covid-19 from the conference. They also have yet to be contacted by any health, government, or corporate officials with suspicions that someone might've been exposed to the virus at the conference.
While it's a start, it'll certainly take more research to figure out if CES actually helped to spread the disease throughout the country. 
Regardless, CES is still pushing on. The Consumer Technology Association confirmed that next year's show is still scheduled as planned for January 2021. 
Whether or not anyone attends after all of this remains to be seen."

Experts Fear the Coronavirus Is Spreading Undetected in Southeast Asia,"Researchers say it is virtually impossible that Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, hasn't reported a single COVID-19 case.",https://time.com/5792180/southeast-asia-undetected-coronavirus/,https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/coronavirus_southeast_asia_4.jpg?quality=85&crop=159px%2C263px%2C803px%2C420px&resize=1200%2C628&strip,2020-02-28T07:04:22Z,"As coronavirus cases continue to soar globally, in at least one region a steady façade of optimism persists. Southeast Asia’s foreign ministers have joined hands with China and declared their intention to “stay strong!”
Yet their hastily called meeting in secretive, socialist Laos last week suggests not so much resiliency as the need to shore up mutual support. Health experts are widely skeptical of the numbers reported by China’s neighbors, and believe the deadly infection is spreading undetected throughout much of Southeast Asia.
With infection clusters increasingly sprouting outside the mainland, where the virus originated, many fear these pockets—rooted out or not—are sustaining the outbreak and pushing the world toward a global pandemic.
The disease, officially COVID-19, has sickened over 83,000 and killed more than 2,850, primarily in China. But cases have spread to more than four dozen countries, and been identified as far away as Brazil and Finland.
Strangely absent from the list are Myanmar and Laos, which border China, as well as Brunei, East Timor, and Indonesia—of which the latter had daily, direct flights to the virus epicenter, Wuhan. Every other country in the region, all beneficiaries of Chinese aid, investment and tourism, has reported cases.
“The transmission dynamics of this virus are like the flu. It’s very, very difficult to stop,” says Richard Coker, a Bangkok-based professor emeritus of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
At the beginning of the outbreak, several of these governments downplayed the severity of the threat, publicly voicing their wariness of offending the superpower upon whom their economies rely. In lieu of public health precautions or stringent defenses, they offered folk remedies—suggesting everything from consuming onions or alcohol to working less to ward off coronavirus.
“Surely the desire not to alienate China was a factor,” says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Overall, the region is just so heavily tied to China now.”
In Cambodia, which has increasingly gravitated into China’s orbit, Prime Minister Hun Sen insists he won’t cut air travel, beyond suspending the six weekly flights from Wuhan. He also refuses to evacuate citizens stranded in Wuhan, as other countries have done. While Beijing chided the U.S. for banning Chinese travelers, saying it “set a bad example,” Hun Sen earned plaudits when he flew to China earlier this month.
“A friend in need is a friend indeed,” he wrote on his official Facebook page.
But Hun Sen’s vehement denial of the disease’s risks has stoked fears that Cambodia, a tourism hotspot with limited health resources, will become yet another vector of transmission.
“The cost of his decision is the health of his people,” says Sophal Ear, an expert on Cambodian politics at Occidental College in California. “Cambodia has become the weakest link: a country with poor health care, poor disease surveillance, and a long rap sheet of non-reporting.”

Earlier this month, a study by five researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that it is statistically implausible that Cambodia and Thailand do not have more cases, and virtually impossible that Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has not reported a single one. Based on its direct flights from Wuhan, the archipelago should have at least five patients by now, the study found.
It’s not that these countries are getting lucky, says Marc Lipsitch, director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, and one of the study’s authors. “They’re missing infections.”
About 2 million Chinese tourists visit Indonesia annually, mostly holidaying in Bali. According to China’s consulate there, 5,000 Chinese tourists, 200 from Wuhan, were visiting the resort island when news of the outbreak suspended flights on Feb. 5. Most werenot quarantinedor tested.
“There are definitely cases. We just haven’t found them yet,” says Dr. Shela Putri Sundawa, an Indonesian physician who hosts health podcast “Relatif Perspective.”
“I think the surveillance we’re doing now is too loose.”
Doctors in Indonesia are not testing all respiratory infections for coronavirus, relying instead on weeding out suspected patients by their links to known cases or their travel history, she says.
But cases have already turned up in several countries among those who have not been to China. Missing one potential carrier can lead to further infections that can’t be linked to travel, meaning more and more patients who might never be screened.
“You can’t find things you don’t look for,” says Lipsitch, the Harvard epidemiologist. “We estimated that even high surveillance countries were missing about half their imported cases.”
He predicts that a global coronavirus pandemic is “likely” and that 40 to 70 percent of the world’s population could be infected (though they won’t all become sick).
‘So what can we investigate?’
In Indonesia, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, security minister Mohammad Mahfud MD has told reporters “the coronavirus does not exist” in the country.
Indonesia’s health officials insist their protocols follow the World Health Organization’s guidelines with a system focusing on temperature checks at arrival gates and self-reporting. Most of Southeast Asia follows this approach, even as several studies indicate border screenings are not effective.
“I think airport scanning is more of a political measure than a practical measure. It might calm people down and demonstrate that the government is doing something, but as for public health, it’s not very useful,” says Coker, the emeritus public health professor.
These screenings must catch people in a very narrow window, between when they are well enough to travel, but sick enough to detect. Temperature scanners, fickle at the best of times, will also not find anyone whose fever may have subsided after a Tylenol on the plane. And just because someone doesn’t present clinical symptoms, doesn’t mean they aren’t sick. Asymptomatic patients still in the incubation phase have shed this coronavirus, according to doctors.
Two tourists who traveled through Indonesia before later testing positive have prompted alarm. A Chinese visitor who traveled to Bali from Wuhan was reportedly confirmed to have the virus on Feb. 4, after he left, while a man from Tokyo was hospitalized with the infection soon after returning to Japan on Feb. 19.
Indonesia’s health directorate general secretary, Achmad Yurianto, told local media he did not know the Japanese man’s name or where he visited. “So what can we investigate?”
The government also said that none of the 243 people who were evacuated from Wuhan on Feb. 2 showed signs of the virus while quarantined at a military hospital on an island northwest of Borneo.
But Dr. Putri Sundawa noted that the standard quarantine lasts 14 days, while the disease incubation period can stretch potentially as long as 24 days.
“If there were no complaints of pneumonia, they would not be checked,” she says.

Relying on self-reporting once cases are introduced to the country creates further problems if patients and medical workers don’t know what to look for. An Indonesian woman with viral pneumonia was reportedly discharged because she had not been to China, while a nurse who cared for her had “no idea” the case could have been a coronavirus suspect.
It’s also hard to test for coronavirus without the right lab kits, which Indonesia lacked until February 5. The country’s health minister, a former military doctor who previously stoked controversy for urging a “brainwashing” treatment on stroke victims, determined that prayer had kept the virus away. His message to the public: “don’t be anxious.”
Myanmar, like Indonesia, has not reported a single case of coronavirus as of Friday. The restive country shares a 1,400-mile, porous border with China over which goods and people continue to flow.
Until donated testing kits arrived on Feb. 20, no domestic hospitals were able to confirm coronavirus cases. Previously, samples had to be shipped to Thailand or Hong Kong with results taking up to one week.
In a country with limited political freedoms and a kneejerk reaction to negative press, the government has kept a tight lid on coronavirus. Even government spokespeople said they did not have permission to comment on what preparations were being taken for an outbreak. Rather than empower the spread of information, the Health Ministry has reportedly proposed amending legislation to punish any healthcare workers who talk to the press or public about the virus with up to six months in jail or a $70 fine.
‘Extreme risk’
“Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said earlier this month.
With the exception of small and affluent Singapore, which experts have praised for its response to coronavirus, Southeast Asian governments spend little on health per capita by international standards. Even Indonesia, with a population of nearly 270 million spread over thousands of islands, faces discrepancies in health resources and suffers an overall shortage of facilities and personnel.
While admitting they may struggle amid an outbreak, Indonesian health officials insist they will contain the virus before it becomes one. But many health experts say it’s too late, as coronavirus will ultimately evade containment.
Coker, in Bangkok, says all countries should be preparing for a pandemic and implementing mitigation measures, like closing schools, preparing hospitals and redistributing medical staff as needed. Southeast Asian countries, he says, should assume they have cases.
The U.K.’s National Health Services has already seemingly made the leap. Anyone returning from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos with symptoms, however mild, is advised to call the NHS hotline. Global risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft warns of “extreme risk” in Indonesia and Cambodia based on those countries’ ability to respond to a pandemic.
Yet even amid concerns about regional preparedness and possible equipment shortages, several Southeast Asian nations have been rushing to donate goggles, face masks and respirators to China. Laos, with a GDP comparable to Mali’s and Afghanistan’s, mustered $400,000 and $100,000-worth of supplies for the world’s second-largest economy after a national fundraising campaign.
Such political genuflection may have broad consequences. How nations across the world cope with coronavirus, and what they choose to prioritize, could resonate globally. And because of cross-border travel, migration and international tourism, Southeast Asia is highly interconnected with the rest of the world.
As countries everywhere grapple with or brace for coronavirus, the possibility of undetected cases spreading throughout the region underscores how the virus can no longer be assumed to stay confined to a handful of outbreak clusters.
“The significance of not recognizing the true breadth of the outbreak is that it continues to suggest to some that the travel bans and quarantines are effective tools in limiting global spread,” says virologist Christopher Mores at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.
“The sooner this outbreak is appreciated for the pandemic it has become, the better for a coordinated global response.”

The study, done by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the overall chances of dying from COVID-19 — the disease caused by the virus — are 2.3%. Other estimates suggest the fatality rate could be higher: around 4.3%. The current rate, based on the ratio of reported deaths to total cases worldwide, hovers around 3.4%.
But the Chinese CDC study found that the fatality rate rate rose to 8% for patients in their 70s and 15% among those in their 80s.Out of more than 44,000 coronavirus patients studied, the majority of deaths were among those at least 60 or older.
Older patients are also more likely to have preexisting health problems. The first patient to die of the coronavirus in the US, for instance, was a man in his 50s who had been chronically ill before getting infected.
Nearly 5,300 patients in the Chinese study reported a health condition not related to the virus, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Around 7% of those cases — more than 370 patients — died. Overall, patients with preexisting conditions represented more than a third of all deaths reported in the study. The fatality rate for patients who reported no underlying health problem was less than 1%. 
Here's the mortality rate for each preexisting condition reported in the study:
Ruobing Su/Business Insider
The authors were missing the health history of more than 20,000 patients in their study, but their research is still provides one of the broadest pictures so far of how COVID-19 operates in humans.
Among coronavirus patients, the preexisting condition that raises risk most appears to be heart disease. Patients already diagnosed with heart disease had a fatality rate of more than 10%. Diabetes was the preexisting condition with the second-highest fatality rate: 7%. 
Patients with the most commonly reported preexisting condition, hypertension (high blood pressure), had a fatality rate of 6%. Coronavirus patients with cancer had a similar fatality rate. 
In total, COVID-19 has killed nearly 3,000 people and infected around 86,000. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, central China's most populous city, and has since spread to at least 58 other countries. More than 90% of cases are on the Chinese mainland.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said two more Americans tested positive for the virus out of the group of quarantined passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington state worried about the virus spreading through West Coast communities after confirming three patients were infected by unknown means.
The World Health Organization upgraded the risk level from the virus to “very high” as it continued to spread around the globe. Friday evening, the State Department issued an advisory telling Americans to avoid nonessential travel to Italy, which has seen nearly 900 cases. A travel advisory already is in place for China.
Two days after the White House abruptly shifted gears from President Donald Trump’s initial assurances of minimal U.S. fallout to an all-out mobilization under Vice President Mike Pence, the administration’s messaging still wasn’t completely seamless.
Trump administration political appointees and nonpartisan career government scientists both agree that the current risk to Americans is low, although that could quickly change. But some political officials are continuing to offer assurances that concerns will blow over soon, while the scientists are emphasizing preparations for circumstances as yet unknown.
“I acknowledge that this could change. I acknowledge the situation could deteriorate. I acknowledge the risks,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday. “But, given what we know … looks to me like the market has gone too far.”
Financial markets continued to slide, with the Dow Jones average suffering its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.
Later in the day Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank would cut interest rates to support the economy if needed. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers of both parties are working on a spending bill to be unveiled early next week and expected to be two to three times more than the $2.5 billion the White House had requested for anti-virus efforts.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called attention to the breadth of options under consideration, telling reporters the administration may invoke the 1950 Defense Production Act to ensure production of needed supplies for anti-virus effort. For example, the government says it needs 300 million masks for health care workers, but only has 30 million stockpiled.
“We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary,” said Azar. “So that is the authority that we have and we intend to use to acquire anything we need to acquire.” However, he added the government wants to avoid disruptions.
Shortly before the new California case was announced, Trump told reporters, “We’re at the same number.”
“We haven’t lost anybody yet and hopefully we can keep that intact,” he said as he left the White House for a political rally in South Carolina.
Trump said he’s still considering denying entry to people from countries affected by coronavirus. “We’re looking at that right now,” he said. “And we’re looking at a couple of countries, a few countries that have little bit disproportionately high number, and we’re going to make that decision very soon.”
For the CDC’s disease detectives, the priority now is setting up a nationwide testing infrastructure after a shaky start. Dr. Nancy Messonier, the CDC’s chief of respiratory diseases, told reporters the goal is to have every state capable of testing for the virus by the end of next week.
A three-step test kit from CDC is being replaced with a two-step process that Messonnier said should work better.
“Our goal is to have every state and local health department doing its own testing by the end of next week,” said Messonnier. That’s a considered a critical step, because it would push the front lines of surveillance closer to local communities where new cases might present themselves.
Disease detectives are still tracing the contacts of a Northern California woman who may be the first person in the U.S. to get sick without having traveled to China or having been in close contact with a returning traveler.
“We need to remember right now that the case count in the U.S. is really low,” said Messonnier. “That is a reflection of the aggressive containment efforts of the U.S. government. We hope that if there is spread, the spread will be limited and that any disease in the United States will be mild.”
The global virus outbreak has become a test of Trump’s credibility and his administration’s capacity to protect the nation. Public health experts say the president should let the scientists in government take the lead.
“The White House functions best when it follows the leadership of experts in emergency response,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonprofit Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve public health.
Although the president himself is famously skeptical of science, the White House is now trying to surround itself with top-flight scientific expertise. Friday, officials announced the White House and the National Academy of Sciences have established a committee of experts on infectious diseases to help on the coronavirus threat.
“We are creating a direct line to the nation’s top scientific minds on public health,” said Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Next week, Congress is expected to expedite a bipartisan spending bill for the anti-virus campaign that could total between $6 billion and $8 billion.
The administration says it has enough funding to get through to April but that Congress should act as quickly as possible to approve additional funding. The White House wants Trump to sign the spending bill it by mid-March.
As other countries hard hit by coronavirus cancel public activities and shutter schools, HHS Secretary Azar said such measures could be part of the containment toolkit here, if needed.
Keeping kids home from school and running workplaces on a skeleton staff is part of what experts call “social distancing,” a way to keep people from passing disease to one another. As recently as 2009, a flu pandemic led to school closures in many U.S. communities.
“It can be indicated under certain circumstances that it might make sense to close a school or schools, or take other measures like that,” said Azar. In the U.S. that would be a decision made at the local level.
“What we’re all trying to do is just be very transparent … with the public to get our mental frame around that there are things that you might see,” said Azar. “That doesn’t mean you will see (them).”

Vice President Mike Pence announced the new restrictions and warnings as President Donald Trump said 22 people in the U.S. have been stricken by the new coronavirus, including four deemed “very ill” and that additional cases are “likely.” Trump added that he was considering additional restrictions, including closing the U.S. border with Mexico in response to the virus’ spread.
“We’re thinking about all borders,” Trump said.
Trump provided an update on the virus from the White House press briefing room for the second time this week after the first reported U.S. death Saturday, of a woman he described as being in her late 50s and having a high medical risk. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was “no evidence of link to travel” in the case of the woman who died.
On Friday, health officials confirmed a second case of coronavirus in the U.S. in a person who didn’t travel internationally or have close contact with anyone who had the virus. The U.S. has a total of about 60 confirmed cases. Trump’s tally appeared to exclude cases of Americans repatriated from two cruise ships in Asia.
Trump said healthy Americans should be able to recover if they contract the new virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets spooked by the virus threat.
He encouraged Americans not to alter their daily routines, saying the country is “super prepared” for a wider outbreak, adding “there’s no reason to panic at all.”
He added he wasn’t altering his routine either. “You’re talking about 22 people right now in this whole very vast country. I think we’ll be in very good shape.”
Trump spoke a day after he denounced criticism of his response to the threat as a “hoax” cooked up by his political enemies. Speaking at a rally in South Carolina he accused Democrats of “politicizing” the coronavirus threat and boasted about preventive steps he’s ordered in an attempt to keep the virus that originated in China from spreading across the United States. Those steps include barring entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China.
“They tried the impeachment hoax. … This is their new hoax,” Trump said of Democratic denunciations of his administration’s coronavirus response.
Trump said Saturday he was not trying to minimize the threat of the virus.
“Again, the hoax was used in respect to Democrats and what they were saying,” he said.
Some Democrats have said Trump could have acted sooner to bolster the U.S. response to the virus. Democratic and Republican lawmakers also have said his request for an additional $2.5 billion to defend against the virus isn’t enough. They’ve signaled they will provide substantially more funding.
Trump said Democrats want him to fail and argued that steps he’s taken so far have kept cases to a minimum and prevented virus deaths in the U.S.
As global markets plunged this week, Trump predicted they will come back, and encouraged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
“The markets will all come back,” he said. “I think the Fed has a very important role, especially psychological. If you look at it, the Fed has a massive impact.”

Masks are selling out like crazy, sellers are price-gouging, and somehow, someway people are selling awful merch tied to the deadly, rapidly spreading virus that's officially named COVID-19. 
Amazon, particularly, is a nerve-racking site to visit amid the crisis.
A cursory search for a coronavirus mask or a surgical mask turns up lots of options, but they're either sold out and expected to be out of stock for weeks or they are exceptionally costly. A pack of 100 disposable masks, for instance, has about quadrupled in price over the last few weeks to $15, Wired reported.  Some bulk foods appear difficult to purchase. In Italy which is suffering through the largest European outbreak hand sanitizer prices have reportedly skyrocketed online.
It's worth noting masks aren't even recommended unless you're actively coughing/sneezing or if you're taking care of someone who is sick. Experts do recommend washing your hands frequently and washing your hands correctly and avoiding touching your face. 
The rush to purchase these supplies has appeared in lockstep with the stress that's overtaken people in the U.S. as the virus continues to spread throughout the world. However, an expert told Mashable that this doesn't necessarily mean people are panicking. In some ways, stocking up is a method of taking control.
""People wanting to be proactive about their well-being is not necessarily indicative of panic,"" said Dr. Samantha Penta, an assistant professor of emergency preparedness at the University at Albany's College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity.
Still, it can prove to be an unproductive cycle. Attempting to buy supplies online, if what you're after has already been pillaged, can ramp up anxiety. The world which has 150 million Prime users relies heavily on Amazon. It's odd and discomforting to see it without products. Not to mention, it's a little scary to even feel the need to parse through emergency supplies in the first place. 
A pack of masks retailing for $67 that apparently wouldn't ship for weeks.

Amazon, meanwhile, said it's working to stop merchants from taking advantage of the crisis.
""There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,"" an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. ""We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers. We continue to actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.""
Amazon previously sent an email warning merchants about masks that were not in compliance with pricing policies, according to Wired. 
No doubt, it's a frightening time. There have to date been more than 83,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. 
""Do not mistake me: I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, on Wednesday. ""Every scenario is still on the table.""
Even in this time of potential crisis, some folks are trying to capitalize on the virus by selling surprisingly lighthearted merch. Asthe Vergepointed out, there are coronavirus shirts all over Amazon that look like something you'd get off a New Jersey boardwalk. The t-shirts feature pretty tasteless jokes from everything about Corona beer to ""keep calm and resist coronavirus.""

Worse still, Amazon like just about anywhere online is full of information of questionable validity. It has had to remove more than 1 million products that falsely claimed they were a coronavirus cure. People are also selling books making all kinds of unproven claims like Satan or biological warfare caused the outbreak, Business Insider reported. 
There have been all kinds of responses online, from these ""joking"" t-shirts to social media sites filled with worrying, if often questionable, information. 
""I think something thats important to drive home is that this is a consistently evolving situation,"" Penta said. ""Its just important to not fill the gaps with false information."" 
While the internet might be stressful during the coronavirus outbreak, experts have stressed it's not time for folks to panic.
""It's good to take precautions, but you don't have to live in fear."" Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon."

Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
Doctors say one of the best ways to monitor patients with COVID-19 is by tracking their blood oxygen levels, which can show when they have dangerous breathing problems even if they dont feel short of breath. But along with toilet paper and digital thermometers, devices that measure those levels, called pulse oximeters, are hard to find. Theyre either sold out or taking weeks to ship from major retailers. 
With the devices out of reach, people are turning to questionable alternatives: the third most popular paid iPhone app last week claims to be able to measure blood oxygen levels through the phones camera, despite a disclaimer that says the app is not a medical device. On Reddit, some people fighting off COVID-19 say theyre using a health feature on some Samsung phone models to check their oxygen levels. Others say theyre using pulse oximetry features on smartwatches. 
That concerns doctors. Despite their accessibility, research shows pulse oximetry apps dont accurately measure blood oxygen levels, especially when theyre low. And relying on apps could be dangerous, says Walter Schrading, director of the office of wilderness medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.
The apps are easy party tricks when youre not sick: put your finger on the camera, get a normal oxygen reading. You can see, Im a normal human being, breathing normal air, he says. But when someone actually has low oxygen levels, theyre likely to still give that normal reading. They dont work well when you actually need them to work well, which is when your oxygen levels drop, Schrading says. 
Schrading and colleagues evaluated three iPhone pulse oximetry apps in a study published in 2019, and found that they couldnt reliably identify people who did not have enough oxygen. Their findings were consistent with other studies, which also found that pulse oximetry apps were inaccurate. A recent analysis from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, which reviewed the research on apps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, also concluded that they are unreliable.
Oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted, the authors of the analysis wrote. 
NEW rapid review by me (small clinical/ editing role) and Lionel Tarassenko, Professor of Electrical Engineering (major bioengineer role):
Q: Can smartphone apps be used to measure oxygen saturation?A: No.https://t.co/iIQqi66tUM
 Trisha Greenhalgh (@trishgreenhalgh) April 2, 2020
Apps dont work well because most use a different mechanism to test blood oxygen levels than standard, medical pulse oximetry devices. The devices send two different wavelengths of light usually red and infrared through a fingertip, where theres lots of blood close to the surface of the skin. Hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in blood, absorbs more infrared light when its carrying oxygen and more red light when its not. The device calculates the difference to determine how much oxygen is circulating. 
Smartphones usually only have white light, so theyre not able to get as accurate a reading. Samsung phones have a red light function, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said, but they only use one wavelength and would likely be unreliable as well.
In addition, standard pulse oximetry devices send light wavelengths through the finger and read the results from a sensor on the other side. Smartphones send and capture the light from the same spot they rely on the reflection of the wavelengths. That method tends to be less accurate and can be skewed by light from the environment. 
Some models of Fitbit and Garmin smartwatches also have pulse oximetry features. Fitbit can track oxygen level trends during sleep, and Garmin can give on-the-spot readings. Their watches do use red light, but they use the less-accurate reflective method. They also take readings from blood flow at the wrist which isnt as strong as it is at the finger. Both companies note on theirwebsites that their devices should not be used for medical purposes. 
Accurate blood oxygen readings are important when people are trying to monitor any disease, but its particularly key for COVID-19. Usually, someone with a low blood oxygen level knows it they struggle to catch their breath. If a person has a reading on a lower-quality oximeter that says they have low oxygen levels, but they dont have those symptoms, doctors can usually assume the sensor just isnt working, wrote James Hudspeth, the COVID response inpatient floor lead at Boston Medical Center, in an email to The Verge. 
People with COVID-19, though, sometimes feel fine even when their oxygen levels are plummeting. Thats why some doctors want pulse oximeters given to everyone home sick with the virus: if they can come into the hospital as soon as their oxygen levels dip but before theyre gasping for air, they might be treated more effectively. But it also means doctors would have less confidence interpreting a pulse oximeter result that doesnt match symptoms, Hudspeth said. 
If apps cant tell when oxygen levels are actually low, they could give a false sense of security to people who also feel okay. This thing could read normal, but you could not be normal, Schrading says. Its a big risk, he says. It would be dangerous to rely on them because they didnt measure what they were supposed to measure.

 (CNN)On Thursday, we hit a grim watershed. The US overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. This is a dire crisis and an extraordinary failure of President Donald Trump. Americans are suffering and dying because the Trump administration failed to act quickly and decisively to prevent the virus' spread. The US has now seen about 1,195 deaths and the number is rising rapidly. 
On Thursday, the US saw an increase of more than 15,000 cases in one day -- a shocking surge that can be explained by both the spread of the virus and increased testing after weeks of shortages -- pushing the total number of confirmed cases over 82,000. China, in comparison, has reported 81,285 cases. 
There is a fundamental difference between China and the US. China has broken the spread of the virus with a lockdown that first started in Wuhan on January 23 and is now being lifted in stages; only a few dozen new cases are allegedly confirmed each day, and most of these are apparently introduced from abroad. The US has not broken the epidemic. And if Trump has his way, easing guidelines to stay at home by Easter, we will fail to stop the epidemic and millions more will be infected. Even with active control, we might be facing around 81,000 deaths by July according to a new detailed analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The transfer of the virus, which may have originated in bats, to humans was an unforeseen event. The response to that event has been determined by the policies of nations. On December 31, the Wuhan government publicly confirmed it was treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new pneumonia outbreak and on January 7, officials identified a new coronavirus as the cause. The first confirmed case in Japan was identified in mid-January, with South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and the US following suit within days.
The East Asian countries went into action. Many had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak and had public health teams on alert for new epidemics. More than two months later, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed in the US, with more than 250 cases per million people, far higher than China, which has approximately 57 cases per million; Hong Kong, 60; Taiwan, 11; Singapore, 117; Japan, 11; and Korea, 180. 
Trump bears direct responsibility for America's unpreparedness and failed response to the epidemic. Since Trump came into office, he has systematically taken apart our protective public health system. The pandemic unit at the National Security Council was dismantled in 2018 under his watch. Trump slashed the CDC's epidemic control teams in 39 countries, including China. And when the epidemic hit, Trump ignored it, downplayed it, and made repeated false claims. Even now, he spouts vulgar nonsense about restarting the economy by Easter when public health experts say the threat is going to persist for far longer.
Trump is profoundly culpable, but he is not the only reason for America's dismal situation in the face of this epidemic. Our for-profit health care system rakes in money on disease, not on health. Instead, we have a system that works for the rich, instead of a public health system for all Americans that readily anticipates and controls new pathogens through testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. 
Americans across the country are fighting to stay alive, while Trump acts as if he is more intent on saving the economy. We can still try to control the virus as the East Asian countries are doing. We need decisive action across states and cities. We are finding leadership today in our governors, mayors and our brave frontline health workers."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)I talk about and explain things for a living. I have also been covering the coronavirus outbreak for weeks.
But when it comes to talking about all this with my own children, I've been finding myself tongue-tied.
At first, I didn't talk about it with my daughters. I have a 5 and a 2-year old, so I just made sure to remind them they needed to wash their hands more often.
But when my eldest daughter walked out of school and declared, ""Mom, there's something called 'Corona' and everyone is getting sick,"" I knew I couldn't avoid it any longer.
I then tried telling my 5-year-old ""there is a sickness"" but she didn't need to worry too much about it. That led to her asking in full voice, walking down the sidewalk, ""Does that person have the sickness?"" Then pointing at the next person and asking again, ""How about that person? Does he have the sickness?""
It quickly set in that I needed some help, expert help on how to have this conversation. I also quickly realized I'm not alone. My producer told me her 6-year-old wanted to know if he could still give her a kiss goodnight as he was concerned that he would give her the coronavirus.
As parents, we could all use a little help in this unprecedented moment. I started with the person I always go to first when it comes to the health and well-being of my children -- our pediatrician. ""The fewer words, the better always,"" Dr. Bruce Brovender of Global Pediatrics advised. ""But always be honest."" 
If you're not, he said, ""You actually make things scarier and more traumatic because they don't know what the truth is and what [it] is not.""
Brovender's guidance motivated me to dig deeper. And after spending hours on the phone with doctors, experts and clinicians, I've found some helpful common threads of the dos and don'ts when talking to our little ones about something so big.
 Be reassuring but be honest
""The most important thing across ages is that children need to know that they're going to be OK and chances are their parents are going to be OK,"" says Tovah Klein, director of the Barnard Center for Toddler Development at Columbia University. ""The first thing is to reassure them about that.""
""It's a balance between addressing children's worry and fears, because that is real, and reassuring them because the truth is most people do get better from this.""
Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, adds that comes with the balance that this can't be treated like any other day. ""It's really critical that people understand that it's not like a snow day. We need to not have play dates. We need to not have the birthday parties; we need to postpone those until we have a clearer picture of what's going on with this.""
And in explaining these abrupt changes to children, it's important to remind them ""the grown-ups are handling it,"" says clinical psychologist Rebecca Schrag Hershberg. ""We don't have to pretend we know all the answers, but we do have to project a calm confidence that there are smart people everywhere -- doctors, policymakers, teachers -- all working together to make sure we get through this.""
""Children are hearing a tremendous amount. They're hearing big words that they've never heard before, none of us have really,"" says Klein. ""Even the terms coronavirus and Covid-19, it's like what's that?
""I've been telling parents that it's really important that the parent is the filter of the information,"" Klein adds. For older children that may be addressing misinformation they hear from friends or on social media. For younger children that may just start with demystifying terms, like answering ""what is coronavirus?"" The answer Klein suggests: ""It's a really big word but it's a fancy word for what we normally call a cold or the flu and something that's been around for a long time. Now there's a new virus and that's what everyone is talking about.""
Hershberg agrees that transparency is key. ""I think transparency for kids, even little kids, is more comforting than the alternative when they notice that there's a huge elephant in the room, but they also notice no one is talking about it."" 
""Listen first and talk second. Listen for concerns, questions and misinformation while you are enjoying usual play with your children -- whether that is drawing, dolls, or throwing a ball. Then let kids know you're glad they are asking you questions and sharing what is on their mind,"" says Dr. Joshua Morganstein, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Psychiatric Dimensions on Disasters. ""Young children need fewer words, and they'll be reassured and comforted by a calm parent.""
Hershberg adds that it's a good practice to avoid the tendency to want to fill the silence when it comes to these types of sensitive conversations with your kids. ""If they ask a question, you answer their questions in a direct, clear and brief way and then pause and see if they have any more questions. Pause and see what happens next."" 
How to say, 'I don't know'
It's OK to say ""I don't know,"" experts agree. ""In fact, it's important to do so,"" says Morganstein. ""When children find out you misled them, it will undermine their trust in you.""
But it appears there are more helpful ways to say, ""I don't know"" than just saying ""I don't know."" There is, ""I don't know. Why don't we look that up together,"" says Morganstein. This allows you to model for the child that when you don't know something, you seek out information about it. ""This can really enhance a sense of trust that a child has in you, knowing that you can count on your parents to tell you what they know, tell you want they don't know and then go find out the answer.""
""You can say, I need to think about that,"" says Hershberg, helping play out another ""I don't know"" scenario. ""Saying I don't know in a calm and puzzled voice, not in panicked and worried voice, is not uncomfortable for our kids unless we make it uncomfortable."" 
""Kids can feel really comforted when you say 'you know there are so many people asking that exact question at this exact moment. We are in a community of a whole world of people, all asking that question.'""
This is all about how to talk to our children about Covid-19. And so, I was perhaps most surprised about how many of these experts emphasized the impact of our own stress and anxiety levels on how our children are handling and processing this uncertain time.
""It's overwhelming for parents right now because this is such a fluid situation. Every day, even every half day it's a new thing going on with Covid-19,"" Goza told me. ""So, it's overwhelming for parents and it's really frightening for kids.""
But it starts with us not making matters worse for our kids. ""First, check your own stress level. If you (or other adults around them) are behaving in a highly stressed manner, your children may simply be picking up on and emulating this behavior,"" says Morganstein. 
""Don't talk to your kids about any of this stuff when you're in a moment of anxiety,"" adds Hershberg. ""If you hear something or read a tweet that makes you really anxious, it's OK to say to your child, 'before I'm going to answer that question, I'm actually feeling a little bit worried right now so I'm going to take my three deep breaths, do you want to do that with me?'""
And an important reminder, that kids of different ages will express their anxiety in these anxiety-inducing times in very different ways.
""Overall, it's important to remember that distress looks different in kids and in children at different ages. Isolation, diminished academic performance or aggression may be seen in older children. Irritability, lethargy or return to earlier age behaviors can be seen in young children. For parents who are understandably distracted and already feeling heightened stress themselves, this can be easily misinterpreted as 'misbehavior',"" says Morganstein.
When we are all feeling pretty helpless, let's be honest, it can help children through these moments by giving them some of the power back. That can be helpful when explaining why they have to wash their hands so much, why they can't play with their friends like they normally do and it can be especially helpful with questions about grandparents and the elderly.
""Empower children by saying, look we don't get very sick [from the coronavirus] but believe it or not we could still have that virus, we have to help so that not too many people get sick. That's part of our job,"" suggested Klein.
""That also explains the hand washing -- 'that keeps the germs away and the virus away.'
""That explains school closing -- 'we're trying to really keep this virus from spreading so you're not going to be with so many other people. That's why mommy or daddy has to work from home now.' All of those pieces can be put in the context of we're all working together.""
Hershberg reminds us that children often process difficult events through play, so empower them to do that. ""Cast a magic spell on the virus... Pretending to be Elsa and freezing the virus. Those are all things that will help kids feel powerful and also let them process the feelings.""
So, let them play out the feelings, whatever they are. ""It's healthy and means they feel safe talking about it,"" says Hershberg.
Giving that sense of empowerment to older children understandably requires a different approach. ""There's going to be a lot of sadness about missing sports events, proms and a lot of things, and I just think we have to give them that reassurance,"" says Goza. ""The more we do now to make this pandemic be as short as we can...then the sooner they'll be able to get out and do those things.""
""You can be the germ destroyers or germ busters,"" says Klein. ""Making it light and fun. Not making it so serious that is scares the children.""
Hershberg agrees saying, ""Your family [are] superheroes fighting the virus and every time you wash hands, you are taking a step to keep people healthy and safe,"" she suggests. ""You are emphasizing that this is an active choice and that we are all joining together to do it. And not that we're all just helpless in our houses waiting to hear what's going on.""
While no one can say for sure when this crisis will end, this expert advice gives me a great place to start when it's time for more tough conversations in the days ahead -- when the girls and I aren't playing Super Germ Busters."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)A college friend who is now a physician first introduced me to an electronic cigarette in 2008. He purchased his online from China with the hope of transitioning from smoking to vaping but found himself using both instead. A few years later, he shared a pleasant surprise -- he had succeeded in quitting both vaping and smoking. 
The breakthrough came one winter while he was recovering from a cold. As he reached for the e-cigarette, he realized the hazard of exposing his recovering lungs to a cloud of smoke. He gave his e-cigarette away, and never vaped or smoked again. His success story highlights the power of a second event to break the nicotine addiction. The current Covid-19 pandemic may serve as a similar warning call to smokers and vapers to stop promptly.
Over the past 10 months, three serial waves of severe acute respiratory illnesses have strained the American emergency care delivery system from 1) e-cigarette, or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI), 2) the influenza season, and 3) Covid-19. Around June 2019, US hospitals first noted a rise in respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked this EVALI outbreak into early 2020, ultimately counting 2,807 hospitalized patients in all 50 US states, with 68 deaths as of February. Overlapping with the EVALI crisis has been the influenza season, which runs from October through May. So far, the CDC estimated there have been at least 39 million US cases of the flu, leading to 400,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 deaths. The third stress has been the worldwide pandemic of Covid-19, totaling, at the time of writing, 337,933 cases in the US and 9,653 deaths. 
Smoking has many negative effects on respiratory health, and the possibility of a relationship between smoking (both traditional cigarettes and marijuana) or vaping with Covid-19 were raised by early observations in China. One report, looking at 1,099 laboratory confirmed cases in China, revealed that 12.4% of smokers either died, required ICU admission or needed intubation, compared to 4.7% among never smokers. Another study found that among Chinese patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, the odds of disease progression (including death) were an order of magnitude higher among smokers compared to non-smokers. The World Health Organization has noted that cigarette smokers are likely to have more serious illness if infected with Covid-19.
The FDA has advised that cigarette smoking and vaping may leave users with underlying health conditions and increase the risk of coronavirus pneumonia and increase its severity. Further research should be undertaken to determine the extent. The US Surgeon General has reported that smoking is strongly linked to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and coronary artery disease, all of which impair the immune response and the ability to fight Covid-19. 
Active research is ongoing to assess the long-term health risks of marijuana use and vaping, including pediatric chronic bronchitis. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio highlighted a possible connection between the coronavirus and vaping after noting a healthy 22-year-old New York City man, whose only risk factor appeared to be a history of vaping, was hospitalized for Covid-19. The CDC has reported that up to 20% of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in the US are between ages 20 and 44, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom noted that half of the Covid-19 cases in California are in younger adults aged 18 to 49. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speculated that the popularity of vaping might explain the increased incidence of Covid-19 among youth and young adults, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse has included vapers on the list of groups who could be most impacted by Covid-19.
A related question is whether previous vaping-related lung injuries may predispose to a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. EVALI patients who survived may develop long term respiratory issues. If they were to contract Covid-19, they might also be at greater risk for respiratory failure, prolonged intubation and mortality. 
As they recover from the coronavirus, smokers and vapers should make every effort to stop to protect their lung health. Repeatedly inhaling from an e-cigarette (possibly coated with viruses or bacteria) violates the principle of minimizing contact with one's mouth and face to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19. Sharing an e-cigarette with others only increases that risk further. While the cigarette butt is discarded after each use, e-cigarette devices are used repeatedly. Perhaps e-cigarettes should be designed to be disposable, to minimize the risk of infection transmission. Another area to study further is whether the plume of vaping aerosol generated might deposit virus particles on surfaces in the environment. 
The majority of cases from the EVALI outbreak were associated with vaping of marijuana/THC contaminated with vitamin E acetate. But the CDC did not exclude that other causes might exist, as 14% of the EVALI patients ""exclusively used nicotine-containing products.""
Perhaps some of the mysterious EVALI cases from the winter of 2019 should now be re-analyzed, to determine if the coronavirus may have played a role. Bronchoscopy biopsies and lung specimens stored in pathology labs across America could be assessed to see if coronavirus RNA is present. Similarly, reanalyzing influenza cases from the winter may reveal if the current cases of infection we are witnessing are actually a second wave.
The initial impact of Covid-19 on the e-cigarette industry was an interruption of the supply chain. About 90% of the world's e-cigarette hardware is produced in China, and many factories in Shenzhen were closed during the coronavirus outbreak there. More recently, many vape shops across America have closed, having been defined as non-essential services. This likely made it more difficult for youth to acquire vaping devices from peers or older siblings, or at school. Another unintended benefit of mandatory school closures has been the opportunity for parents to monitor, and have conversations with their children while they are at home to curb youth vaping.
Given the adverse effect on respiratory health, the current coronavirus pandemic should serve as a message to both smokers and vapers to quit promptly and take immediate action to reduce their risks of viral transmission. 
And if doing so immediately seems like too big of a task, at the very least, other measures like regularly sanitizing e-cigarettes and cannabis smoking devices should be taken.
Smokers and vapers should also be more mindful of the secondhand smoke and clouds generated, avoid generating large clouds in public from vape tricks, and follow clean indoor air laws. Social distancing could be extended to the vapor generated to maintain a 6-foot distance from others when in public spaces, or to smoke and vape only in confined spaces. Active research is ongoing but difficult to conduct while simultaneously treating a pandemic, and many questions about the risks to smokers and vapers and those around them will be answered over time. 
Ultimately, Covid-19 presents a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate our nation towards the dual goals of smoking and vaping cessation."

Local officials have confirmed that Tesla stopped making electric cars in California on Monday, March 23rd, in compliance with a shelter-in-place order brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic. But dozens of workers had to report to the companys automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factorys employees. 
This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insiderand Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.
The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these end of line workers that theyd have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week. 
The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order
A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it conducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance with the shelter-in-place order. Their vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures, they said.
Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldnt receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the companys guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.
The current factory worker said Teslas end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with moderate issues. But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be work in progress, which, therefore, required more end of line work. 
Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19. 
Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible. 
Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US
At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open. 
The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to basic operations like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.
Its currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Teslas environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees had been working from home for nearly two weeks before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their direct coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms. Both employees are quarantined at home and recovering well, Shelby wrote. 
Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory as soon as humanly possible as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.

Amy is also a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and recently came out with a book called The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity. The Future Today Institute recently published the 2020 Tech Trends Report, which is a quantitative look at the big trends that will dominate the future. Nilay and Amy discuss the different paths the report takes on predicting that, with the state of technology use today, there’s no future in which we are not being scored. Amy and Nilay also discuss whether we could have predicted the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, as well as how possible it is to predict a solution and a timeline for that solution right now. Below is an excerpt of the conversation edited for clarity. Nilay Patel: We’re in the middle of a pandemic. It’s here, it’s happening. It feels like no one knows what’s going to happen next, or is this something that you’re able to model or understand? Amy Webb : So I don’t want to get too nerdy here, but if you have a discrete set of data — like Johns Hopkins [University] has discrete datasets now going back to December because we’ve seen corona outbreaks in a couple of areas around the world that have lasted a little longer than what we’re seeing in the US. So given what we know to be true, and the data that they have access to, and all of the other variables over which they would have some kind of control — like whether or not we take aggressive measures in the United States today, whether or not we somehow have a whole bunch of tests, things like that. If you look at historic data trends and then all the stuff that over which we have control, you could predict a handful of plausible outcomes that tell us a little bit more about how many people could get sick at what rate and what the mortality could look like. But most of the time, we’re talking about areas of life over which we don’t have complete control. There’s no way to have total control because there’s too many variables at play. And at that point, the math doesn’t work. You can have the most powerful computers in the world, but the computations don’t work out. You would need a continual stream of data that’s really comprehensive and evolutionary algorithms in order to make sense of it all. So we’re feeling huge amounts of anxiety about coronavirus, about the oil prices tanking. I liken this to that sense of out of controlness, if you’ve ever driven on a slippery road. If you’re driving and you hit an icy patch, most people, their instinct is to slam on the brakes. And why do we slam on the brakes? Because the act of slamming on the brakes makes us feel like we have control again. And the reason we feel like we have control is because we think we know what the future is going to be. If we slam on the brakes, the car will stop, we will be fine. That would work if you were in charge of every single variable at that moment in time, but you’re not. So slamming on the brakes and really, really, really hoping things don’t change from where they are right now or that they’re going to be like they used to be is a really great way to set yourself up not only for a crash — because that’s how you really lose control of a car — but it’s also a good way to set yourself up for disappointment. And that kind of thing has — when we extrapolate that to society — has reverberating effects. So right now what I’m observing is sort of a feverish corporate anxiety. I’m seeing governmental anxiety, and companies, just like people, have limbic systems. What do you mean by a limbic system? So it’s the fight or flight part of our bodies that evolution bestowed upon us millennia ago so that we didn’t get eaten by tigers or whatever. And we’re hearing people talk a lot about their sort of crushing anxiety, and I get that. I’m going to be the first person to tell you if you gave me all the data in the world and all the computers in the world, at this moment in time I cannot tell you what things are going to look like in three months. And that’s fine because that tells us we still have some agency. Futurists are trained to think through plausible outcomes, not so that we can accurately predict what’s next, because that’s not our goal right now. Our goal is not predictions. It’s being prepared for what comes next. And that’s good news. The good news is if you are willing to lean into uncertainty and to accept the fact that you can’t control everything, but also you are not helpless in whatever comes next. If you’re willing to adopt — and anybody can do this, it costs no money. It’s just a different perspective. If you’re willing to think more like a futurist, which is to say confront your cherished beliefs, lean into uncertainty, and be nimble with how you think, you’re going to get through this. The challenge is that I’m seeing the sort of corporate anxiety which, once you get on a cycle of that, is hard to stop. Companies start making weird decisions or they slam on their brakes. I mean, we’ve seen a bunch of that over the past couple of weeks. This is as much an opportunity to identify risk as it is to think through where are effective measures that we could be taking to not just help out everybody else but help our bottom line. There’s a lot of opportunity here. I mentioned this to you guys earlier: I’m politically independent, but I’m a pragmatist, and my greatest fear right now is that the Trump administration are nowists. They are not futurists. They think only about what’s good for them right now. They are absolutely unwilling to think long term and they are absolutely unwilling to make short-term sacrifices. In the past, that has resulted in entertaining tweet storms, that has resulted in irritations. This time around, it’s going to result in people dying. And we have to be willing to confront the fact now that, without being alarmist, without being emotional, we just have to be willing to confront alternative futures. We have to right now be willing to accept uncertainty and to think the unthinkable. And right now, that means accepting the possibility that by the end of the summer 2 million Americans could die. And if that’s a plausible future state, then how do we work backward to create a better outcome? In New York, stuff is shut down for a couple of weeks. In some ways that’s going to help flatten the curve as people are now saying. But that’s a short-term solution that doesn’t address a longer-term issue. And the real problem here is a psychological one because we’re going to get to the end of those two weeks and I think people are going to feel as though the virus should be gone and it’s not going to be. So we have an opportunity now — individually, collectively — to start mapping out alternative futures. They don’t all have to be dystopian. There are lots of really awesome things that could also happen as a result of this. For example, we’re starting to see huge investments in synthetic biology and new ways of using AI as a way to speed scientific discovery. That’s amazing because on the end of this, we could wind up with precision medication, we could wind up with synthetic agriculture as a way to mitigate climate change. There are going to be some good things on the other end of it. And now is the time to start thinking through “where is there risk, where is there opportunity, and how can we start modeling alternative futures?”"

It’s understandable since fever is an extremely common symptom of the disease.

Before you schedule a telehealth visit with your doctor, know this: there’s nothing “normal” about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That number came from a 19th century German researcher named Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich who conducted a painstaking study of patient body temperatures and arrived at a mean of 98.6. It’s an impressive bit of clinical work, but it’s sorely in need of an update. So what does pass for “normal” these days?

Apple and Google announced a system for tracking the spread of the new coronavirus, allowing users to share data through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions and approved apps from health organizations.
The new system, which is laid out in a series of white papers, would use short-range Bluetooth communications to establish a voluntary contact-tracing network, keeping extensive data on phones that have been in close proximity with each other. Official apps from public health authorities will get access to this data, and users who download them can report if theyve been been diagnosed with COVID-19. The system will also alert people who download them to whether in close contact with an infected person.
Apple and Google will introduce a pair of iOS and Android APIs in mid-May and make sure these health authorities apps can implement them. In the months after those are complete, the companies will work on building tracing functionality into the underlying operating system, then let users decide whether to share information with a wider range of apps.
Contact tracing is one of the most promising solutions for containing COVID-19, but it also raises massive privacy concerns. Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concern about tracking users with phone data, arguing that any system would need to be limited in scope and avoid compromising user privacy.
Unlike some other tracking methods like, say, using GPS data this Bluetooth plan wouldnt track peoples physical location. It would basically pick up the signals of nearby phones at 5-minute intervals and store the connections between them in a database. If one person tests positive for the novel coronavirus, they could tell the app theyve been infected, and it could notify other people whose phones passed within close range in the preceding days.
The method still has potential weaknesses. In crowded areas, it could flag people in adjacent rooms who arent actually sharing space with the user, making people worry unnecessarily Its also a relatively new program, and Apple and Google are still talking to public health authorities and other stakeholders about how to run it.

Photo by Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images
Over the weekend, a man in North Dakota was arrested for coughing at a local Walmart. The store, like all Walmart stores, was limiting the number of people allowed in at once. The man apparently wasnt happy to hear that, and intentionally coughed on store employees, the police chief said.
He joins agrowing listofpeople arrested in the US for intentionallycoughing in public in the past few weeks, as the accelerating outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in states around the country put people on edge, alert for the slightest sign that they could be exposed to the illness. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and spreads through tiny droplets of saliva produced when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or breathes. 
Those people arent being arrested under coronavirus-specific laws, says Lindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University Washington College of Law. Men in North Dakota and New Jersey, for example, were charged with terroristic threats, or threatening to cause physical harm or violence to someone. Prosecuting them for coronavirus-specific physical harmwould be much harder.
You would have to show person who did thecoughing was infectious, and was capable of transmitting the disease, Wiley says. Since testing is so limited now, its a hard case to make: the cougher would have to know they were infected for someone to prove they intentionally spread the virus. The coronavirus is also so widespread that if someone who had been coughed upon got sick, itd be hard to prove exactly where they got it from it could have been from anywhere.
Creating or jerry-rigging laws to punish people for specifically spreading COVID-19 is technically possible, and people may feel like those who dont take the virus seriously or who give it to others should be punished. But turning someone who passes on a disease into a criminal doesnt keep a community safer, Wiley says. 
Public health experts have seen that ineffectiveness play out with other viruses. There are alreadycriminal laws in dozens of states that punish people with HIV who engage in activities that may put others at risk of contracting the virus even activities that pose an extremely low risk of spreading HIV, like oral sex. Theres no evidence that criminalizing those types of activities is effective as a disease control strategy, Wiley says. The type of person who would actually, intentionally give someone else a disease isnt dissuaded by a criminal law, she says.
What it does is have a big effect on people who would never intentionally spread disease, because its a chilling effect on getting tested, she says. Its not going to help with those tiny number of people who would do that, and it might cause problems in efforts to reach people who are well-intentioned. People may be reluctant to get tested or tell people that theyre sick with a virus if theyre afraid of getting arrested, which can hinder public health efforts. Vulnerable or low-income people, who arent able to avoid the type of contact with others that could pass on the novel coronavirus because they work a service job, for example would be more likely to be affected by these laws. That would add another layer to existing inequities that are being made worse by the disease. 
In most states, legislators would have to create a new law specific to COVID-19 if they were considering treating it the same way some do HIV. Logically, creating coronavirus laws would be more difficult than HIV laws because this disease is much harder to trace than something thats sexually transmitted. 
I could see some city council member deciding [they]want to be seen as taking tough action here, Wiley says, despite the fact that theres evidence that these types of laws do more harm than good. I would hope that lawmakers wouldnt waste their time."

Nearly everyone in the US will be affected in some way by the COVID-19 pandemic, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus by stress and anxiety, event closures, or the illness itself. Theres cause for concern: the disease can be deadly, and the outbreak in the US is likely to continue to get worse. 
Theres still a lot that scientists and doctors dont know about the new coronavirus and the illness it causes. With three months of data, though, it appears that around 80 percent of people who are infected have a mild or moderate illness, around 15 percent have severe disease (which requires hospitalization), and around 5 percent are critical (and go into respiratory or organ failure). Around 3 percent of people with confirmed cases of the infection in China died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Different groups of people, though, are more likely to fall into the severe or critical categories than others:
The elderly: People who are over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19, according to data collected by the WHO. The highest death rate is in people above the age of 80. Around 15 percent of people in that age group died from the disease in one set of Chinese patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who are older stay away from crowds and avoid nonessential travel.
Children: Children, on the other hand, dont appear to get as sick. Very few develop the disease in the first place, and if they do, only a small group develop severe or critical disease. No young children have died from the virus in China. 
Researchers are still trying to figure out why thats the case. It may be that childrens lungs are less susceptible to infection or that their immune systems are stronger. Children might carry the virus around, though, and pass it between each other and then to their parents and caregivers. Thats why kids should still wash their hands as much as adults. Its also one of the reasons why areas where the virus is spreading are closing down schools. 
People with chronic conditions: People who have underlying health conditions like high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, or diabetes are also more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19. Around 9 percent of people with diabetes who contracted the virus died, for example, as did around 8 percent of people with high blood pressure. The CDC also recommends that people in this group avoid crowds, stick close to home, and stock up on medication for their condition if theyre able to. 
Everyone else: Most people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus dont get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you dont get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk and pass the virus to them. Thats why its so important to stay home if youre not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but its the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. Its the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves. 
Not everyone can work from home, stop taking public transportation, or skip large gatherings, though. If you can do those things even though they may seem silly and even if there have not been many cases identified in your area you can help blunt the impact of the pandemic.

AT&amp;T is the latest enormous company to instruct its employees to start working from home if they havent already. The work-from-home edict does not apply to AT&amp;Ts retail employees, equipment installers, and CNNs TV talent and production staff, according to CNN. But AT&amp;Ts massive corporate workforce (including those at WarnerMedia) are being asked to work from home for the time being as long as their role allows for it. 
We are committed to helping limit the spread of the virus and risk of exposure, WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey said in an internal memo. We can help minimize stress on the resources and infrastructures around us by doing our part to reduce population density in our commutes and daily activities, in efforts to help reduce spread of the virus. AT&amp;T has over 245,000 employees, according to CNN. 
It now joins other large companies in shifting to at-home work as health officials and cities encourage social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19. In support of our colleagues who need to continue working in our offices, we need to help reduce population density and risk of exposure in those locations by minimizing the on-site staff, Stankey said. 
CNN boss Jeff Zucker said its unclear how long this guidance will remain in effect in a memo to employees, but said everyone should assume that it may be long term. We encourage you to use today to make sure you are completely prepared for remote working, Zucker said.
Theres no avoiding office work for many roles at CNN, however, just as AT&amp;Ts wireless employees will still need to keep the companys stores operating smoothly. CEO Randall Stephenson said AT&amp;T is taking precautions to help workers stay safe in the days and weeks ahead if they do need to leave home. 
I realize that many of you are directly serving and interacting with our customers and that work cant be done from home, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a message that went out to employees. What you do is vital to a highly connected society like ours. And it is even more critical in times like these. So, we will be taking additional safeguards and implementing new procedures and policies to help protect you from the virus.
AT&amp;T has suspended its arbitrary broadband caps (for customers subject to them) in response to the coronavirus pandemic and has also signed onto the FCCs Keep Americans Connected Pledge, vowing not to disconnect subscribers or hit them with late fees as everyone makes the necessary life changes to do their part in combating the virus."

Googles sister company Verily has launched a screening website for people who want to get tested for COVID-19. However, Verilys website is very limited in scope: its only available to people in the Bay Area of California and its more of a pilot program than a public health utility.
In fact, its even more limited than that: in order to qualify you must be 18 years of age or older, be able to speak English, and be a US resident. It very much looks like the program a Verily spokesperson described to us on the phone on Friday and not the expansive triage system that the Trump administration promised.
The new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: 
The initial question on Verilys site asks Are you currently experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms? If you answer yes, you are told that the program is not the right fit and to seek medical attention. Reached for comment on this issue, a Verily spokesperson said that:
This screener was developed in partnership with government health officials. The initial question is meant to ensure that anyone who is seriously ill does not come to our sites because they are not prepared to provide medical attention. We are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help us refine this COVID-9 risk screening and testing.
If you answer no, youre asked to sign in with a Google account and sign an Informed Consent authorization form. It details that your data may be shared with public health officials. 
After that, you are led through a series of screener questions about your symptoms:
The actual screener asks questions about travel and work responsibilities. And it re-asks questions specifically about each symptom. Theres a few more additional questions but it took about 3 mins to read and respond. pic.twitter.com/t0M8GzIP4l
 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 16, 2020
In a blog post on Sunday, Verily said that it was working closely with the state of California on the pilot program. It did not make any promises about expanding the program beyond the state of California:
Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase. The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsoms office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks.
Verilys site is located at Project Baseline, which to date has only been used to connect people up with potential clinical trials. That infrastructure for collecting and protecting health data was one of the reasons that Verilys screening site was put on Project Baseline. The site also claims that any information you provide wont be shared with your insurance company or connected to your Google account though a Google account is necessary to use the site. 
A screenshot from Verilys new site
The website launched after a weekend of confused and inaccurate statements from the White House about a website it claimed Google is building. Google had not expected to be mentioned in Fridays press conference, according to Wired. And so it initially had not planned to build such a site, Axios reported, but began to scramble after Trumps statements. Over the course of the weekend, Google itself did not correct the record but instead issued a series of tweets pointing to Verilys sites and to its own efforts to provide information on the coronavirus. 
Earlier on Sunday, President Trump held up a printout of those tweets from the Google Comms account and claimed that they substantiated his original statements on Friday. Googles tweets did not, but they also carefully avoided directly contradicting the president. Google itself has not announced a screening website for COVID-19. 
Google has instead said it will launch an informational website, according to this post from CEO Sundar Pichai:
This includes best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses. Well be rolling out an initial version of the website late Monday, March 16, and well continue to enhance and update it with more resources on an ongoing basis.
That more comprehensive site may yet come, as Vice President Mike Pence again promised in Sundays press conference that such a site could be made, and he made a point to say that the administration was also working with other tech companies. It is not clear what that work looks like, or if those tech companies were approached before the scramble over the weekend.
Whats clear right now is that Verilys website as it currently exists is a pilot program limited in scope and availability. Whats even clearer is that the administration has not yet provided full details to US citizens on when and how they will be able to gain access to a coronavirus test, though it is clearly rushing to find a way to do so."

Google plans to add a Zoom-like gallery view to its business- and education-focused Meet videoconferencing service and let users take calls right from Gmail, Googles GM and VP of G Suite Javier Soltero told Reuters in an interview. The additions come amid huge growth for Meet as families, students, and workers use the service while at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The upcoming gallery view will let users display up to 16 meeting participants in one frame, according to Reuters. That functionality is coming later this month, said Soltero. Zooms gallery view, by contrast, lets you see the thumbnails of up to 49 people in one screen, if you have a powerful enough CPU to display them all.
Meets new integration with Gmail sounds similar to starting a video call with Hangouts
Meets new integration with Gmail sounds as if it will let Meet users start or answer a call right from their Gmail window, similar to how you can start or answer calls using Hangouts, Googles consumer-focused chat and videoconferencing app, in Gmail. The feature will begin rolling out for G Suite customers today on the web and to mobile at a later date, Google tells The Verge. 
With more and more people working and learning from home, we want to make it easier for you to connect and keep things moving forward, Google said in a statement to The Verge. With Meet in Gmail, you can easily start or join a meeting in seconds. Our goal is to help you follow the flow of the day, seamlessly switching between email and video meetings whichever form of communication you need.
Google is also adding the ability for Meet to improve video quality when you have dim lighting conditions and to filter out background noise while youre on a call, according to Reuters. Those features will also be added later this month, Reuters reports.
Google said last week that Meet was adding more than 2 million users per day. Meet has added more daily users than any other Google service since January, according to Reuters. A recent peak in Meet growth added 60 percent more users than the day before, Soltero told Reuters.
Last Thursday, Google extended free access to some advanced Meet features until September 30th previously, that free access was scheduled to end on July 1st.

Bill Gates is now the favorite target for coronavirus misinformation according to data compiled by the New York Times and Zignal Labs, a company that analyzes media sources. Conspiracy theories conflating Gates with the virus were mentioned 1.2 million times on TV and social media from February to April, 33 percent more often than the 2nd most popular conspiracy theory linking 5G with COVID-19, according to Zignal Labs, peaking at 18,000 mentions a day in April.
Hoaxes directed at the Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist, are all over YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. The New York Times found 16,000 posts on Facebook this year that were liked and commented on nearly 900,000 times. The 10 most popular Youtube videos spreading misinformation about Gates and the virus were viewed almost five millions times in March and April. The falsehoods being spread vary, but range from him creating COVID-19 in order to profit from a vaccine, or of Gates being a member of a plot to cull humanity or implementing a global surveillance system.
A Bill Gates speech from 2015, where he warns that the greatest threat to humanity is infectious disease, not nuclear war, has received 25 million new views in recent weeks. According to the New York Times, anti-vaxxers, right-wing pundits, and members of the conspiracy group QAnon claim the video is evidence of Gates dastardly plan to use a pandemic for his personal gain.
Gates has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump
Gates has longbeen an outspoken critic of President Trump. On Wednesday, he said Trumps decision to defund WHO was as dangerous as it sounds, although he didnt call out the president by name. Gates also criticized the administration in a recent op-ed, saying Theres no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus.
Although Gates refused to comment on his new-found notoriety, Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, told the NYT that it was distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives."

Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said that conspiracy theories linking the rollout of 5G to the spread of COVID-19 are false in an interview with CNBC today.
Theres no correlation at all between 5G and coronavirus, Vestberg said. Its just fake news. He said Verizon planned to combat the conspiracy theories with our communication, and the industrys communication, and with health organizations communication.
Theres no correlation at all between 5G and coronavirus.
Vestberg was referring to communications already issued by health organizations and information combating conspiracies about wireless devices and health that can be found at www.wirelesshealthfacts.com, a Verizon spokesperson tells The Verge. That site states that radiofrequency energy from wireless devices and networks, including radiofrequencies used by 5G, has not been shown to cause health problems, according to the international scientific community, and points to resources and quotes from wireless communications bodies and health organizations supporting that assertion. 
The site also links to a WHO website that spells out how COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets and that viruses cannot travel via radio waves or mobile networks.
Despite no scientific evidence establishing a link between 5G and coronavirus, conspiracy theories connecting the two have spread across social media, leading to 5G towers in the UK being set on fire and people harassing workers laying fiber optic cables. My colleague Tom Warren has put together an explainer about why these conspiracy theories dont make sense.

All substantial market corrections or bear downturns begin with some form of catalyst. Just forest fires have their proximate cause in the carelessness or maliciousness of human behavior, or lightning strike, on dried woodlands – so too must the destruction of tenuous market values always have a point of ignition.
So it was with commercial real estate defaults in the late 1990s, with Japan entering recession at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, and with residential mortgage delinquencies in 2008. So it has been with the global concern over the novel coronavirus designated COVID-19. Something, even an event wholly unrelated to the market bubble, is always the immediate trigger of a meltdown.
And, as I wrote in this space one month ago, well before the ongoing viral crisis took hold of investors' – much less the world's – attention. The equity markets (particularly those in the US) were just waiting for someone or something to strike a match.
This is not to minimize the magnitude of the viral threat. It is real and – moreover – is the cause of material supply chain, transportation, tourism and trade disruption that will have a substantial impact on economic activity over the next several months. There is even the possibility of its impacts lasting through the point at which a corresponding anti-viral vaccine can be synthesized, manufactured and distributed in large quantities. And I am washing my hands frequently. But, as with all modern pandemics, COVID-19 will eventually be tamed. 
Daniel Alpert
But is it reasonable to believe that equities will recover their inflated value? This is a less certain proposition. (Although the market closed well off its lows on Friday.)
On the one hand, this sell-off has exceeded the magnitude – in percentage terms – of market disruptions observed during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and the Ebola crisis of 2014 (albeit with some delay from the first expressions of US-related fears over coronavirus). But is this an expression of the degree of the present biological predicament, or is it the measure of the magnitude of the bubble that preceded it?
After all, in both 2003 and 2014 equity markets were a mere 30 months and 4.8 years, respectively, from their prior pre-recession highs, and 42% below and 23% above those prior highs, respectively.
The present crisis began with the S&amp;P 500 nearly 13.5 years from, and a whopping 109% above, its last pre-recessionary high. 
When news of COVID-19 hit the tape about a month ago, equity markets were about to hit further all-time highs in a rally that was unbelievably long in the tooth – supported (or not) by some of the most off-the-charts valuation multiples since 1929, 2000 and 2008. It stands to reason that the bigger they are (market valuations), the harder they fall – right?
As I pointed out last month, however, there is another enormous difference afoot: While interest rates have been falling for nearly 40 years, we are now in uncharted territory throughout the advanced world. That bonds do not offer returns that move anyone's longer-term investment needle (other than traders who, if long, have benefited enormously), has produced an environment that can only be deemed investment desperation for those seeking to have their money produce for them.
Daniel Alpert
10-year and shorter interest rates on US Treasuries are now well into negative real (inflation-adjusted) return territory. And while inflation is likely to fall as well, given pre-existing sluggish economic conditions made significantly worse by the pandemic, the US is clearly in the process of joining the majority of advanced nations in depriving savers and investors of positive risk-free returns when lending to their governments. 
This leads to the conundrum voiced to me so often by frustrated investors: ""what else are you going to do with your money?"" Until very recently, for many, the answer appeared to be to wager it on additional valuation expansion in equities. I say valuation expansion because we clearly have not been seeing either rapid economic, nor any broad earnings, growth for over a year that could have justified prices paid for stocks.
The question then becomes, will the even lower rates that this latest crisis has delivered (to say nothing of Fed action to lower the policy rate in order to stabilize equity markets – which will do nothing more than that for the economy at large), (a) reignite and increase the level of desperation that drove money into the equity markets, or (b) be seen by investors as a clear expression of actual, and anticipated further, economic weakness and stifle traffic to the casino that equity markets have increasingly become.
It is difficult for me to expect a complete return to the status quo ante – even as the COVID-19 crisis dissipates. The equity markets were sicker than the virus that knocked them back on their heels. The market's recovery will be far slower than that of patients infected with the disease.

""Notable increases"" in deaths were seen in March and early April, the team led by the Yale School of Public Health found. This was especially true in New York and New Jersey, states hard-hit by the pandemic. 
The study was first reported by the Washington Post.
Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the team found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19. ""That is close to double,"" Dan Weinberger, who studies the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Yale, told CNN.
The team could not show whether the increased deaths were due to coronavirus, Weinberger said. But there are strong indications that they were. For instance, the team also looked at data on doctor visits.
""What we see is that in many states, you see an increase in influenza-like illnesses, and then a week or two later, you see an increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza,"" Weinberger said. ""It provides some confirmation that what we are seeing is related to coronavirus."" 
Plus, in especially hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey, where coronavirus is known to have spread widely and infected many people, overall deaths were far in excess in what would normally have been expected in March. 
""In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote.
Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths. The state reporting of deaths in the pandemic closely tracked what the Yale team found. But others did not.
""For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths,"" the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive). 
The new coronavirus causes respiratory disease, and deaths would presumably be listed among the regular reports of deaths and illness from pneumonia and influenza. But doctors are increasingly reporting other, sometimes fatal, symptoms from Covid-19, including strokes, kidney failure and heart damage.
Patients already weakened by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may have had a death listed as being due to one of those causes, rather than coronavirus. 
Plus, it's possible that coronavirus lockdowns would have led to a lower-than-average death rate. For instance, if fewer people were driving, traffic deaths could be expected to fall, Weinberger said.
So Weinberger's team looked at both deaths from pneumonia and influenza, and deaths from all causes.
""We decided to look at all deaths from pneumonia, or all deaths overall, and see how those numbers were changing,"" Weinberger said.
The CDC tracks deaths from pneumonia and influenza by the week, and compares them to a baseline of deaths to keep tabs on the annual epidemic of seasonal flu. Separately, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC, keeps data on all reported deaths.
The Yale-led team subtracted the expected number of deaths for each week from the total number of deaths that were actually reported, and counted the extra as Covid deaths.
""Many states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to P&amp;I (pneumonia and influenza) starting in mid-March through March 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity,"" the team wrote in their report.
Weinberger's team found evidence that people were dying as states struggled to find out if the virus had even arrived in their regions. ""In some states, such as Florida and Georgia, the increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks,"" they wrote. 
The researchers said their work shows it may be more accurate to estimate Covid deaths, rather than try to count each and every positive test.
""Given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions,"" they wrote.
""It also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with COVID-19 directly or indirectly.""
Some public health experts have said Covid-19 was almost certainly spreading in the United States in January and perhaps as early as December, long before the U.S. reported the first official death. Some state and local health officials are going back to see if people who died in January and February may have in fact been infected with coronavirus. 
Officials in California said last week that a 57-year-old woman who died February 6 had been infected with Covid-19 and was actually the first recorded death in the US from the virus. Before that announcement, the first coronavirus death in the US was thought to be that of a man in Washington on Feb. 29."

He also promised to donate 5,000 ventilators to the ""international effort,"" including 1,000 for the UK.
The ventilator can be mounted on a bed, run on batteries or wall power and doesn't require a fixed air supply, according to Med-Tech News. It's also efficient in conserving oxygen and has a user interface designed specifically for healthcare providers.
Many patients with COVID-19 develop severe respiratory symptoms and can't breathe on their own, so a ventilator is essential for treatment. In countries hit hard by the pandemic like Italy and Spain, hospitals don't have enough for every critically-ill patient. With coronavirus victims flooding hospitals, that has forced doctors to essentially decide who gets to live or die.
The UK government has been criticized for its slow and disorganized response to the coronavirus crisis compared to other European nations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who just confirmed that he now has COVID-19, personally contacted James Dyson to ask for help with the ventilators. Existing ventilator makers criticized that move, with one company saying that ""the government should have given funding to existing ventilator manufacturers, and existing companies like us.""
The device still needs to be approved by UK regulators, though Dyson has pledged to help get it through as quickly as possible. On the manufacturing side, a company spokesperson told CNN that the ventilators would be ready to go by early April. ""The race is now on to get it into production,"" Dyson said."

But, in truth, we're still largely at the beginning of our experience with COVID-19. There's still so much we don't know. If you have the virus, think you have virus, or just want to know what it's like to be sick with COVID-19, there's still a hell of a lot of mystery. There's a laundry list of potential symptoms and wildly different levels of sickness, and new informations is coming out every day. 
One community on Reddit is doing its best to help provide answers or, at the very least, a space to collect firsthand experiences with the virus. The subreddit, r/COVID19positive, is a place where people with the virus talk about their experiences and ask questions of others who have had it or currently have it. It also allows people to ask questions of those who tested positive and has a dedicated thread that collects the many conversations centered on ""I Think I Have It."" 
The subreddit, which has almost 49,000 subscribers, effectively serves as a clearinghouse for the many different experiences people have had with the disease. It can be a scary place, for obvious reasons, but also an uplifting one. In one popular post from Thursday, for instance, a user who described themselves as ""a slightly fat, mildly asthmatic smoker"" updated the subreddit to share which symptoms had finally eased. 
""My throat no longer hurts, Im still more fatigued that usual but Im free of the dreaded virus now,"" the update read. ""I hope everyone is doing ok and I just wanted to pass on a positive update that even if youre not the most healthy person in the world you can overcome it, you will feel shit, youll worry, youll take a while to get over it but in most cases you will get there.""
The creator of the group, u/the1andonlyjoja, said they made the subreddit to find these sorts of stories from people who actually had the virus.
""The media was only showing stories of pandemonium in hospitals, places shutting down, and people dying,"" they wrote in a message to Mashable. ""I searched one evening to find stories of people surviving, regular people catching it, and the look of people with mild cases and couldn't find anything so I decided to create a subreddit based around first hand experiences.""  
The subreddit can be a fascinating look at how people are experiencing the virus. People describe all the different ways COVID-19 can manifest itself, such as detailed discussions about gastrointestinal issues and the timeline of all the different symptoms.
I found out about this sub last week. I came on here to see what peoples experiences have been. And fuck, everything has been terrified to read! I know its giving me more anxiety but I come to learn (I had no idea this thing could last more than 2 weeks and man, the range of symptoms people are reporting are maddening). Anyway, I am CONVINCED I have it. But everyone I try to vent to is telling me its all in my head because they know I am a hypochondriac with severe health anxiety.
To preface: the only times i leave my apartment is to walk the dogs. I only just started wearing a mask in the hallways this past week. So if I have it, it's probably from that. I also live with my husband.
Last Friday I had 4 bouts of diarrhea. Saturday normal. Sunday nothing. Monday to today normal (albeit in small amounts) BM. Stomach has felt weird on/off too, but no loose stool or diarrhea. My throat doesnt hurt but it feels sore where my adams apple is. My chest hurts mildly in the center but comes and goes. And today ever since 2pm I have felt dizzy. Ive been taking my temperature ever since my first bout of diarrhea and its been fluctuating in the 98 F range and 96 range. My normal temp (I take it a lot, like I said, hypochondriac) is usually in the 97 F range.
Im so scared things are going to get worse from here on out. Because based on what Ive read, symptoms come and go, get better and worse, and new ones arrive. So Im afraid for what later tonight and tomorrow brings. I am convinced I have it because I read a study that GI symptoms can come before the dry cough or fever. And my GI symptoms started last Friday.
Does anyone have similar experience? I am so scared. I have extreme fear of vomiting and I really dont want it to get to that point.
There are some rules to the subreddit: no medical advice, no memes, be kind, don't troll, don't fear-monger. Users' posts are tagged with flair that indicates if they had it/have it or if they are asking questions of those who did to clear up any confusion. 
There's also the obvious caveat that there is no way to definitively know if people claiming to have COVID-19 actually do (or did). U/the1andonlyjoja said they tell people to take posts at face value and to use the subreddit as just one tool, ""but if there is a suspicion of lies being told or someone is fear mongering or posting just for a reaction the mod team will discuss this individual and remove, mute or ban the poster."" 
For those coming to the subreddit for encouragement, it does appear to be a source of support for some. One person, for instance, recently posted about finding out they were positive and admitted they felt scared and guilty for possibly infecting others. Commenters rushed-in to reassure the original poster that nobody chooses to have the virus and people are mostly doing their best in a hard time. 
A Reddit user posts about how they're feeling after testing positive for COVID-19.

For an online space that deals with such a frightening thing, r/COVID19positive does seem to be a place that attempts to put things in a well, more positive, light. 
The1andonlyjoja wrote that the subreddit has helped them and other people ""know not everyone is dying, not everyone will end up on a ventilator and know that one day we will back to normal but till then we are all in this together."""
11,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Liz Alesse,Did Trump try to cut the CDC's budget as Democrats claim?: ANALYSIS,Did President Trump try to cut the Centers for Disease Control's budget amid the COVID-19 crisis as Democrats claim? An ABC News analysis.,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cdc-headquarters-gty-rc-200228_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,2020-02-29T00:36:19Z,"President Donald Trump is taking heat from Democrats for proposing budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention amid growing fears about a new coronavirus outbreak in the United States, but administration officials say CDC funding has steadily increased since Trump took office.
An ABC News analysis of the presidents budget proposals compared to the congressionally approved spending plans ultimately enacted show both claims are true.
The president introduced his fiscal year 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10, just 11 days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concerns. The spending plan included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels.
In fact, all of Trumps budget proposals have called for cuts to CDC funding, but Congress has intervened each time by passing spending bills with year-over-year increases for the CDC that Trump then signed into law.
During the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina Tuesday, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg accused the president of defunding the CDC, claiming the result is that we dont have the organization that we need.
On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted, The Trump Administration has slashed CDC funding and left positions charged with managing pandemics vacant. The budget request for Coronavirus funding shows they still dont understand the magnitude of the threat.
Asked about the criticism at a House budget hearing Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that, during the presidents tenure, every part of our preparedness and infectious disease program activity has been enhanced and expanded.
Azar went on the say the presidents budget proposals are just the jumping-off point for budget negotiations.
Budgets are like the first move in a chess game with, Ill be honest, a fairly profligate Congress, Azar said. And the president starts that move with a budget knowing that were going to get a lot higher there as we work with Congress.
As health officials gear up to confront a potential outbreak, the administration is asking Congress to authorize an additional $2.5 billion in supplemental funding for 2020 aimed at accelerating vaccine development and other containment measures. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has suggested that figure is not sufficient, and Congress should allocate an additional $8.5 billion for fighting coronavirus.
But its not just the presidents budget proposals that are under the microscope as fears of a new coronavirus outbreak mount. Bloomberg also took aim at Trump for eliminating a position from the National Security Council responsible for coordinating administration efforts to combat infectious disease.
The president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, Bloomberg said. So, there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.
In 2018, Trump administration eliminated the position of senior director for global health security and biodefense as part of a broader downsizing of the NSC spearheaded by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Earlier this month, 27 Democratic senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert OBrien urging him to reinstate the position and asking him to clarify how the White House plans to handle global health security threats.
Families concerned about the novel coronavirus threat need to know the NSC has a dedicated, senior official with appropriate expertise and authority to address the domestic and global health threats from the virus, they wrote. It is of paramount importance that this person approaches this role though a public health lens.
The senators requested a response by Feb. 27, but the NSC did meet that deadline, nor did it respond to a request for comment from ABC News.
Retired Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer held the position of senior director for global health security and biodefense on the NSC from April 2017 to July 2018. He previously coordinated the Presidents Malaria Initiative under President George W. Bush, and is now the senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
Cutbacks at that agency under the Trump administration are also receiving new scrutiny.
Last year, the USAID program known as PREDICT was shuttered. The initiative was launched in 2009 and designed to improve the detection and discovery of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. The program is credited with identifying nearly a thousand new zoonotic viruses, which are transmitted between animals and humans, and influencing the response effort currently being employed to combat the coronavirus, which is a zoonotic infection.
Earlier this month, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sent a letter to the head of USAID asking him to reinstate the program in light of the spread of coronavirus.
The current deadly viral outbreak and its quick appearance in the United States make clear that PREDICTs contributions to zoonotic disease surveillance and forecasting must continue, she wrote. We simply cannot afford to go backwards and jeopardize the success weve seen over the last ten years.
The president has defended his administrations response and preparedness efforts as incredible. On Wednesday, he tapped Vice President Mike Pence to lead a coronavirus task force formed late last month that was being led by Azar. Other members of the task force include NSA OBrien, CDC Director Robert Redfield, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci."

New ARM-powered Macs could arrive in 2021
It would give Apple even more control over the platform instead of relying on Intel.
The company is reportedly planning three Mac processors based on the A14, a yet-to-be-confirmed chip that is expected to power the next iPhone. Apple will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the same firm responsible for its iPhone and iPad processors, to build the new Mac chipsets, according to Bloomberg. And, if all goes to plan, the first hardware featuring the new design will reportedly be sold next year.Continue reading.

More than a year after Polestar unveiled its stylish, all-electric Polestar 2, the company announced that the EV will cost $59,900 in the US. That isn’t exactly cheap, but it’s close enough to the Model 3’s $40,000 price to make it a solid competitor. While it's arguably better looking than the Model 3, it has similar specs. Its 78 kWh battery delivers a range of roughly 275 miles, and it packs 408 horsepower.Continue reading.

Boston Dynamics announced that its Spot robots are helping healthcare providers to triage patients remotely at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The company is sharing the hardware and software behind this robotic telehealth approach, and it hopes other mobile robotics platforms will take advantage of the tech.
The platform uses an iPad and a two-way radio mounted to a Spot robot. Healthcare workers can guide the robots through triage tents where patients suspected to have COVID-19 are asked to line up for an initial assessment. Doctors and nurses can speak with the patients from a safe distance, possibly even their own homes.Continue reading.

As more cases of COVID-19 appear around the world, Americans living countries such as Italy and Japan could soon see their ability to cast ballots affected, according to Democrats Abroad, the group that manages U.S. citizens voting overseas. 
While more than 82,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide and hobbled global markets, the new restrictions mark the first example of the virus impacting the 2020 election. The development comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week identified the first potential case of the virus spreading within a U.S. community and warned that cities, businesses and schools should prepare for a larger outbreak. It also comes just days before Super Tuesday, when 14 states will hold primaries and Democrats who live overseas begin casting their ballots.
Voting is often a difficult process for U.S. citizens overseas, who have typically mailed or faxed their ballots to state elections officials or submitted them electronically. But in recent years, Democrats Abroad has created in-person voting opportunities for presidential primaries by giving Democrats the option to participate in a Global Presidential Primary instead of voting with their home state. 
However, the coronavirus outbreak is eliminating that in-person option for some voters. In China, Democrats Abroad had previously planned to hold in-person voting events in Beijing and Shanghai. Those were canceled last week after local ordinances restricted travel and public events, and the State Department encouraged U.S. citizens to stay indoors, according to Democratic National Committee spokesperson Maya Hixson. Democrats Abroad said on Feb. 26 that it had also canceled in-person voting in South Korea. 
Without in-person voting, Americans overseas would normally have the options of mail, fax or email. But Democrats Abroad China said on its website that packages leaving China are at risk of being stopped, so the group recommends that voters stick with email. This means that voters will be sending their ballots as email attachments from their personal inboxes to an inbox set up by Democrats Abroad. That inbox forwards the ballots to be stored on a secure Amazon Web Services container, which has “enterprise levels of encryption and security protocols built into its infrastructure,” according to Amanda Mohar, global communications director for Democrats Abroad. 
“We want to ensure that our primary process is as secure as possible while also making it as accessible as possible,” Mohar says, adding that Democrats Abroad has a security process that limits ballot access and prevents data deletion. All emailed ballots are then reviewed by an online tally team. Mohar says that Democrats Abroad is confident in its security procedures and does not expect COVID-19 to impact ballot security in any way. 
“The most important thing to understand,” says Mohar, “is that voting is still available for voters no matter what happens.”
Still, election-security experts caution that it’s difficult to fully secure any process that involves voting over the internet. Some states do allow overseas and military voters to regularly submit ballots electronically, while others use secure web portals. The ones that use email typically acknowledge it’s not ideal. When the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report last summer about Russian election interference, it said “states should resist pushes for online voting.” 
“It is absolutely proven that you can intercept an emailed ballot and alter it,” says Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of the U.S. Vote Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that helps Americans overseas vote. “There has been no secure online voting system certified in the U.S. ever. Email isn’t a voting system, let alone secure.”
Outside of China and South Korea, the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in Iran, Italy and Japan. Italy and Japan both have in-person voting planned for next week, so Democrats Abroad are in close contact with officials on the ground there and may cancel their events if needed. 
“The feeling here in Italy on the ground is people are really quite worried. No one knows how scary it really is,” says Nancy Fina, the chair of Democrats Abroad Italy. She said she had not heard concerns from U.S. voters in Italy about emailing their ballots, and was grateful that Democrats Abroad allows people to submit ballots online. “Our number one desire is to get the vote out,” Fina says. “That is very very important for us.”

It's the simplest, cheapest, most effective and straightforward piece of advice health experts are handing out in the face of a novel coronavirus outbreak that's rapidly circling the globe.
So far, more than 83,000 people have come down with the new viral illness caused by the coronavirus, called COVID-19. The sickness prompts symptoms including a fever, dry cough, and in severe cases, trouble breathing and death.
Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed so far are in China, where the virus originated last year. But in recent days, the number of cases being tallied around the world has soared, just as the rate of new infections in China tumbles, prompting concerns that a widespread pandemic could be on the horizon, if measures to contain the virus around the world fail. 
Public health experts still consider basic health and hygiene measures the best defense against COVID-19
""You've heard about washing hands,"" Dr. Sherlita Amler, an adjunct professor of public health at New York Medical College and Commissioner of Health in Westchester County, said recently at a coronavirus conference. 
""If I could teach one thing to the public that would prevent most of the diseases that I have to deal with, it would be wash your hands.""
Officials at the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agree, and have said much the same in recent days and weeks. Regular handwashing is linked to all kinds of great health outcomes, like fewer norovirus cases, fewer deaths, and happier, more diarrhea-free trips to the bathroom down the road. It's also one of the best ways, health experts say, to keep yourself healthy during the coronavirus outbreak. 
As it turns out, though, women say they are heeding this piece of public health advice in significantly greater numbers than men — at least in the US.
According to an Insider Data poll, conducted in online surveys on Thursday, a significantly higher number of women reported they're washing their hands and keeping surfaces clean to ward off COVID-19. 
Specifically, when 1,051 poll respondents were asked: ""What steps, if any, have you taken to prepare for a possible coronavirus outbreak in the US?"" 382 women (65% of those who were asked) said they were ""washing hands and keeping surfaces clean."" Only 243 of the men asked said the same (52.7%). 
That statistically significant poll finding lines up with what other scientists have discovered before. 
Men don't wash their hands as much as women, even though they should
""People who use urinals probably think they don't need to wash their hands,"" Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, previously told the New York Times.
But handwashing experts say that's a bogus idea. 
""It doesn't matter whether you're peeing or you're pooping, you should wash your hands,"" Don Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers who has been studying handwashing for years, previously told Business Insider. ""I think a good general rule of thumb is you should wash your hands any time you feel that they might be dirty."" 
That advice becomes even more important during an infectious disease outbreak. 
The most common way COVID-19 is spread is through person-to-person contact. Regular handwashing, along with keeping a safe distance from others who might be sick (that's about six feet) as well as judiciously avoiding touching your face, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth, are some of the greatest things you can do to stay healthy right now.
Wash your hands for 20 seconds, and scrub them well

Regular, vigorous, and proper handwashing should include soap, water, and last for around 20 seconds. That is long enough to hum ""Happy Birthday to You"" about twice in your head (or out loud, if you like), and it can really make a difference in stopping the spread of all kinds of infectious diseases. 
Regular handwashing cuts down your risk of infection dramatically
Since the 1800s, health care professionals have known good hand hygiene is linked to lower infection rates. It was in the 1840s that Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that when doctors and medical students handled cadavers before touching patients in the maternity ward, more mothers developed fevers and even died. He instituted an unpopular chlorine-washing rule and saw the death rates there tumble.
Similarly, during the Crimean War, nurse Florence Nightingale initiated handwashing rules and other hygiene measures in the British hospital where she worked. Death rates there dropped by two-thirds, providing some of the first hard evidence that proper hygiene saves lives.
Today, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate better handwashing could cut diarrhea death rates in half, and save more than a million lives (adults and children) every year. Regular hand washing can also cut your risk of developing a respiratory infection by 16%.
Pathogens like novel coronavirus droplets can get deposited on surfaces, including doorknobs, elevator buttons, toilet handles, phones, and store counters, which we all touch with our hands and fingers, often before we reach for our faces and mouths. (In the survey, women also said they're wiping down those hard surfaces more often than men are, which lines up with data from The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development: women around the world tend to spend around three hours a day doing unpaid work, while men do just about half that.) 
Even a little more handwashing, especially while we're traveling, could really help.
One 2019 study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Risk Analysis, suggested that simply ""increasing travelers engagement with hand hygiene at all airports"" could reduce the impact of a pandemic by anywhere from 24% to 69%. (The study authors estimated that — at most — only about a quarter of people in airports at any given time clean their hands.) It's certainly not the first evidence we have that handwashing really works, though.
So what are you waiting for? Scrub up already.

It also wanted to offer future users “peace of mind” knowing that they and their packages would be safe.
Ford COO Jim Farley warned during the earnings call that the pandemic could influence society for “many years to come,” with people seeking out more ways to avoid unnecessary human contact. Chief executive Jim Hackett cited what happened in China as an example, noting that a third of car sales moved online as a result of the pandemic.

Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)That two members of Congress (Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams) have now tested positive for the COVID-19 should not be a surprise. If anything, it's surprising we have not seen this sooner. 
On Wednesday, March 11, I was in the Capitol and the three main office buildings of the House of Representatives for meetings scheduled with several members of Congress from both parties. That happened to be the day that the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 had become a pandemic. 
In the course of planning these meetings, I made clear to the two people I shepherded through the House that, with the news surrounding coronavirus and some members going into self-quarantine, these were not normal times in the Capitol -- the buildings would be empty compared to a typical congressional workday and that handshaking would likely be at a minimum.
From the very beginning, entering the Capitol, it appeared as business as usual. Congressional staff, Capitol support staff, security and reporters covering Congress were everywhere. There was no shortage of tourists. Indeed, the Capitol Rotunda was jammed with tour groups. In the Cannon, Longworth and Russell House buildings, as well as one of the House cafeterias, there were plenty of people, whether those who work in the Capitol or those just visiting.
Outside of the House Chamber during votes, the number of people -- Members of Congress, reporters hoping to get quotes, security and visitors like myself -- was overwhelming. Ducking into the House Republican Cloakroom -- essentially a small, private waiting room connected to the House Chamber -- I found that a room I had not visited in five years was familiarly claustrophobic, with members and staff bumping into each other like the old magnetic football table top game of the 1970s. And peeking onto the House floor, the chaotic scramble of people huddled closely, laughing, shaking hands, patting each other on the back -- touching each other, that thing we're not supposed to do! -- was like any other Congressional vote series.
What did all of these encounters have in common? Close human interaction. The awkward, ""wait, we should elbow bump"" happened, but this was the exception. Much more frequent, almost always, there were handshakes followed by a joking, ""\We should not have been doing that."" At one member's office, a sign was posted declaring the office a handshake-free zone. My hand was not shook. I got a hug. Ugh. But just like the handshakes, a hug -- something I didn't think about until I was already doing it -- is a natural and instinctive thing to do. 
Fortunately, hand sanitizer was plentiful everywhere I went and used as often as possible.
Later that day, I joked to friends about how normal everything seemed in the Capitol. But times have changed very quickly. By all accounts, the Capitol complex is now less crowded. All tours have been canceled, staff presence has been reduced, and news outlets have taken steps to protect reporters. Social distancing is happening. But as the Washington Post's Paul Kane noted, there simply is no mechanism for having the House vote remotely, which would be needed to do the people's business while emptying the Capitol. (Lawmakers are introducing legislation that would allow Congress to vote remotely.) 
The sad reality: Expect more members of Congress to test positive, and with that, more self-quarantining. Congress is just too social a place -- and politicians are social animals by nature -- for its members not to be personally affected."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)New York state reached a tragic milestone this week: It now has more Covid-19 patients than any country in the world, aside from the United States.
The state's total of 181,026 cases, as of April 11, is higher than Spain's (161,852 cases) and Italy's (152,271), countries with populations many times larger than New York.
The disease is killing New Yorkers disproportionately. Of the 20,389 deaths in the United States, 8,627, or 42%, have occurred in New York. Its mortality rate is 4.7%, compared with 3.4% in the rest of the country, according to CNN's figures based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. 
New York City and its suburban counties Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland are responsible for 93% of the statewide case count. Furthermore, in New York City, the Covid-19 death rate is about 6% higher than most countries. 
Why does New York seem to be having a different epidemic from most other parts of the country? 
Is the reason simply population size and density? New York is by far the nation's most populous city, with more than 8 million people, twice as many as Los Angeles. But New York also has eight or nine times more cases than any other city so what gives? No other city or county has a fraction of the cases of New York City. 
A caution on numbers: Counting cases and mortality rates is difficult because most counting is done by county or borough or parish rather than city, and city of residence may differ from city of diagnosis or death. Even so, New York City is off the charts. 
How about population density? Covid-19 spreads most easily when people are packed together in churches or cruise ships, in outdoor events like concerts or Mardi Gras, or perhaps in small apartments with multiple roommates or large families. New York's population density, about 27,000 people per square mile, is easily the highest in the country, though it's nowhere near the top for cities across the globe. Many cities in Asia, for example have a density of nearly 40,000 people per square mile.
The density explanation may explain some of the difference, but not all of it. New York's densest borough is Manhattan, while relatively sprawling Queens sits at fourth out of five. But Queens has more than twice the cases and twice the rate of cases as Manhattan.
Maybe it's because so much testing is being done in New York. If you test more, you find more, and if you find more, you test even more. It is likely that more tests, and more tests per population, are performed in New York than elsewhere in the United States, and that the New York rate stacks up favorably to countries with aggressive testing programs, such as Iceland and South Korea and Germany, but comparative information is sketchy. The split between tests performed by public versus private labs has made accurate tracking just about impossible, despite the heroic efforts of such groups as Covidtracking.com, Worldometers, and Our World in Data.
Furthermore, the current advice stay home if you are sick but stable and don't be tested introduces additional uncertainty. This pales in comparison to the clear evidence of deaths at home likely due to Covid-19 but never diagnosed. So yes, New York City probably is testing at a brisker pace than elsewhere and yes, this may contribute to the high case numbers, but we will never have an accurate picture.
The high number of cases and rates likely do derive in some modest amount to each explanation above plus the fact that the epidemic has been in New York City a week or two longer than many other places. A more mature epidemic is always a larger epidemic.
More concerning is the elevated mortality rate in New York City. As has been well documented, some of this is due to the tragic overwhelming of the city's hospitals. We will never know just how many people died due to the country's inept preparation for the pandemic, but the impact surely was, and still is, substantial. 
Still, a mortality rate of about 6% is quite high, even though most countries, particularly in western Europe, have seen mortality rates rise as the pandemic drags on. As patients who have hung on for weeks have begun to die, and the rate of new cases has slowed, this tilts the proportion of fatal cases. 
New York City also has had a very male outbreak; substantially more men have been diagnosed, hospitalized and have died, in keeping with data seen in other countries.
Sadly, the likeliest explanation for the high death rate, though, is the chronically inadequate health care given to minorities and the poor throughout New York City, as in the rest of the country. New York City and New York state have only now released the race distribution of cases and deaths, as well as by zip code, a surrogate for poverty rates. It is clear that severe disease has not been distributed equally by race and ethnicity. 
Black and Hispanic New Yorkers represent 51% of the city's population, yet account for 62% of Covid-19 deaths. They have twice the rate of death compared with whites, when adjusted for age. This likely is due to both a higher proportion of black and Hispanic New Yorkers being diagnosed with severe disease and a higher rate of death among those who are known to be infected.
This disparity likely is the result of several factors. Co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are strongly associated with death from Covid-19 and are more common in black and Hispanic communities. But what causes high rates of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes? Lack of appropriate health care. People who cannot easily find good health care for reasons of money, time, location, or trust may be more likely to stay at home undiagnosed and spread the virus as well as experience potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment.
The explanation is the same for New York City as for Italy, New Orleans and probably Iran: the virus exploits weaknesses in health and health care, be it advanced age or co-morbidity or access to care. 
Hopefully, the Covid-19 pandemic will force us to reckon honestly with the many shortfalls that have been exposed and build a fair, forward-thinking approach that allows doctors and nurses to care for people in need. Failure to do this will only further darken the memory of those who have died and the hearts of those who remain."

Please note that there is much we still don’t know about the new virus, and you should reach out to your own healthcare provider with any personal health concerns. 
  
What are good ways to maintain your mental health? 
I would recommend the following: 
1. Maintain a normal schedule if possible 
2. Exercise (go for walk or run, do an online video) 
3. Maintain social connections via FaceTime, Skype or phone calls 
4. Limit time spent on the Internet and connected to the news 
5. Have “virtual” dates with family and friends. 
  Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Heres how its affecting young minds (here) and how millennials are adjusting to isolation (here) . 
How long will the U.S. really have to be on lockdown to successfully flatten the curve? 
We’re still learning on a daily basis what the case count looks like in the U.S. We also need to consider that there could be a resurgence of cases once public health measures are loosened up.  
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
I defer to the epidemiologists here, but National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci recently said that he’s confident in a range of four to six weeks to 3 months.   
 Dr. Angela Rasmussen, virologist at Columbia University  
  
Do I actually need to wear a mask? 
The WHO advises that if youre healthy, you need to wear a mask only when caring for an infected person or if youre coughing, sneezing or showing symptoms. More here (here) 
  
Is it fair to assume every American will be exposed to the coronavirus this year? 
No, which is one of the reasons we have these current public health measures in place. We are trying to prevent further onward transmission of the disease. 
  Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Almost 100,000 cases have been reported in the U.S. and its territories, according to a Reuters tally of state and local government sources, mapped here. (here) 
  
Is the coronavirus airborne in normal settings and if so, for how long? 
According to our knowledge, it does not stay in the air in normal settings. Most evidence directs us to droplet transmission. Airborne precautions are required only for healthcare workers when undertaking aerosol producing procedures such as bronchoscopy/intubation.  
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Is there potential exposure in elevators?  
Coronavirus guidelines by the CDC are based on the fact that the virus is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets, like a cough or sneeze. In droplet form, it’s airborne for a few seconds, but is only able to travel a short distance. In elevators, social distancing measures should be implemented with a max number of people inside at a time.  
 Infectious Diseases Society of America 
  
How worried should we be about fomite transmission? 
We are still learning about fomite transmission. We know from an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that the virus is viable up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.  
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Can you spread the virus if you’re asymptomatic? 
Yes, but it isn’t the main driver of transmission. This is also why it is extremely important to ensure you have washed hands before touching your face. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
What’s the typical timeline of symptoms?  
From the time of exposure to symptoms it may take on average three to six days, which may be longer/shorter in some patients. Typically it starts with fever, dry cough, myalgia and flu-like illness, then progresses to shortness of breath and pneumonia in some patients.  
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Is it possible that an infected person only has a mild cold before recovering? 
Yes. The most common symptoms a person will have are fever, dry cough and muscle aches/fatigue. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Should people be more concerned about eye protection? 
We certainly use face shields to protect our eyes when in contact with patients.  
 Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease researcher and scientist  
  
Does getting vaccines increase your risk? 
Getting any vaccines would not increase your risk for COVID-19. We’re recommending getting needed vaccines. We want people to get their influenza vaccines so they don’t end up with the flu and in the hospital. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Do people have a natural immunity to this virus? 
I am not aware of “natural immunity” since it is a new virus. We might find as serology testing is rolled out that people have been exposed and developed antibodies without having symptoms. 
 Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher  
  
Is it possible to get reinfected? 
We’re not sure how immunity works or how long it lasts. The best guess is that people who are infected are likely to be protected over the short-to-medium term. We don’t know about longer yet.   
 Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief, New England Journal of Medicine  
  
There are a handful of cases of possible reinfection in recovered patients. (here) But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. 
  
Is there a team working on an antibody test for the virus? If so, when might it be ready? 
There are teams working on serological tests (here). Rolling out on a population scale will be an essential part of the long-term answer, but we need to get through the next month. 
  Bill Hanage, associate professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health 
  
When will a vaccine be ready? 
Vaccine trials may take as long as 12 months. There are multiple clinical trials looking at different treatment options, but we currently don’t know whether this combination is effective and safe for patients. 
 Dr. Muge Cevik, infectious diseases researcher at the University of St. Andrews 
  
Scientists in Singapore are trying to fast-track the process. (here) 
  
What impact will warmer weather have on the spread? 
I have yet to see convincing evidence on this, one way or the other. We are all hoping transmission will slow down with warmer weather in the northern hemisphere, and that warmer countries will be spared the worst. Not enough data yet to conclude. 
 Dr. Suerie Moon, director of research at the Global Health Centre 
  
Heres what we know about seasonal features of disease outbreaks. (here) 
  
I’ve seen several news sources report that experts from Johns Hopkins and other medical colleges are saying the virus can become less deadly as it spreads. Can you explain this phenomenon?  
Yes, one theory for why many viruses become weaker over time is that viruses that kill their host don’t get very far. This pattern of weakening is seen with flu viruses, and many others, but not all. We’re not there yet with the current outbreak. Whether it’s weaker three or 10 years from now doesn’t change anything about today’s situation.
