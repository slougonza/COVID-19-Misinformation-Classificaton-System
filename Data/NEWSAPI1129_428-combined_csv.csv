But what happened to these new home owners when coronavirus descended?,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/one-euro-house-italy-coronavirus/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200519163830-roque-douglas-one-super-tease.jpg,2020-05-20T08:46:45Z,"(CNN) When Italian towns began offering houses for sale for little more than $1, they inspired legions of dreamers to take a gamble on moving to a remote corner of Italy.
Although spending a few thousand dollars extra on renovating the property was usually part of the deal, it was sweetened by the prospect of a new life in an idyllic corner of a beautiful country.
And then the coronavirus struck, plunging the world into crisis, with Italy among the worst affected countries. 
So what happens when you're quarantined in a crumbling home in a remote village where you barely speak the language and can't get home to your loved ones? Does life quickly become a nightmare?
Perhaps surprisingly given the hardships that followed, the answer seems to be no. 
CNN spoke to a few people who bought some of the Italian homes being offered cheaply by towns wanting to reverse declining population trends. 
We found them feeling upbeat and eager to complete their property remodeling and make their Italian dream come true.
Despite the unexpected turn of events, it seems being stuck in Italy hasn't been such a negative experience after all. 
And the virus crisis has made them appreciate even more the beauty of Italy's rural villages -- so much so that some are looking to invest in more cheap properties. 
Miami-based artist Alvaro Solorzano is currently stuck in Mussomeli, a picturesque town in the southern island of Sicily where last year he purchased two cheap properties -- one of them costing just one euro, or a little over a dollar. 
In March he arrived with his wife, son and son's girlfriend to start renovating the houses. The other three headed back to Miami and Solorzano was due to follow them a couple of weeks later, but then his flight was canceled. 
""I lost track of time. We came here together and I ended up living the quarantine in Mussomeli all by myself, without any furniture just a bed and TV, and nobody to talk to,"" he tells CNN. ""That was the hardest thing. Had my wife or son been with me, it would have been different.""
Solorzano had been staying in a B&amp;B, but when this closed because of Covid-19 restrictions, he was forced to move into the less dilapidated of his two properties, which was just about habitable. 
Since then, he's been killing time by watching TV, learning Italian, going to the supermarket (""the nicest part of the day"") and talking on the phone with his family. Little by little, he's been making the most out of the situation by repairing and painting the walls of the house. 
""I did little things but it helped me use time, so when my son and his girlfriend come back their home will be ready,"" he says. ""Luckily the hardware store in town has always been open and I'm so glad we bought two properties and not just the one euro house as it has no water nor electricity."" 
Despite an initial hardship, he says his new neighbors helped him throughout the ordeal. 
""The first two nights were terrible,"" he says. ""It was cold, I slept with my jacket on top of my pajamas but then the neighbors were great. I can't complain. They gave me heaters and even offered blankets, which I had, but I could use their internet."" 
""They kept checking in on me, brought me tons of food for Easter which took me three days to eat. I don't know what I would have done without them.""
Mussomeli, surrounded by honeysuckle and eucalyptus trees, boasts one of Italy's most breathtaking fortresses, known as the Enchanted Castle, which clings like a spider on a pointed rock.
The fertile green farmland is dotted with old sulfur mines, sanctuaries, Roman necropolises and traces of primitive settlements.
The town's name means ""Hill of Honey"" in Latin.
But to Solorzano the sweetest attractions of the place are its welcoming residents. 
""They're wonderful, I know everyone by name,"" he says. ""There's Mario, the guy who delivers the bread. I've got no words to describe how grateful I am of having them and don't know how I could ever repay them for all they did."" 
Initially tough restrictions have now eased in Italy, allowing him to walk around, but at first it was hard, he admits, as there was nothing to do. ""It was terrible, just staying at home, I felt like being in jail sometimes."" 
Now he relishes being able to chat to locals and stroll to Mussomeli's viewpoint, where he can sit on a bench and enjoy fresh air and mountain panoramas. 
As a painter, Solorzano says he would've loved doing some artwork, but due to the lockdown he couldn't find a pallet or a canvas. 
""I'm working hard to try to get back home, but a flight which I recently booked has also been canceled so I really don't know when I will return to the States,"" he says. ""I want to be back before Father's Day in June. I've already missed so many festivities I could have celebrated with my family.""
Solorzano's Sicilian quarantine has made him love Mussomeli even more. The ordeal, instead of having killed enthusiasm for his one euro house adventure, has fueled a desire to purchase a third abandoned building. 
""I love this town and the people, even if they don't know you, they help you out. It's like being in another world. You don't get this in the States"". 
Brazilian businessman Douglas Roque is another dilapidated home purchaser whose enthusiasm for starting a new life has been undimmed by coronavirus. 
Roque was in Fabbriche di Vergemoli, Tuscany, overseeing the renovation of a one euro farm dwelling when lockdown struck and his flight back home was canceled. 
Together with his Brazilian-Italian friend Alberto Da Lio, both from Sao Paulo, the two were also in town to oversee the potential purchase of an entire abandoned area for other Brazilian buyers. 
Had they not been able to stay at Da Lio's family house near Venice, with hotels in Vergemoli shut and the abandoned dwelling totally uninhabitable, they would have had nowhere to go, says Roque. 
Fabbriche di Vergemoli is a cluster of hamlets scattered in the UNESCO-listed protected forest of the Apuan Alps. The area is dotted with ruins of abandoned miners' dwellings overrun by vegetation. Many areas can be reached only by foot. 
Roque's dilapidated three-story farm, which comes with a chestnut cellar and forgotten old wine barrels, is located in the neighborhood of Dogana, where a pristine stream runs below an ancient, picturesque bridge.
""I was about to start the restyle and then everything was blocked,"" says Roque. ""It was terrible, our return flight was canceled and we had issues with the Brazilian consulate.
""I came here in February to pursue the renovation of my house, all the paperwork was done, I was ready to go but couldn't move on with it. And my family is in Brazil, where virus cases have been increasing. I'm worried for them and they're worried for me."" 
The two friends also had to deal with the consequences of a prolonged stay: the hassle of credit card monthly limits and seasonal clothing changes as they arrived in winter and it is now almost spring (luckily, they found some lighter gafrments at Da Lio's). 
While he waits for global air traffic to resume, Roque's anxious to set foot again in Vergemoli as soon as Italian authorities lift restrictions on moving between regions -- a move expected in early June. 
""All this time I've been trying to work on my project online, contacting construction companies and liaising with other Brazilian buyers, friends and relatives interested in buying property in Vergemoli but who can't travel now. I hope to finalize everything soon."" 
Roque says he picked Vergemoli of all places in Italy to buy a one euro house because, despite all that's happened, it remains a dream destination.
""Tuscany is a marvelous region and major historical and artistic cities are nearby. It's the perfect spot."""

Hong Kong (CNN) On June 18, Hong Kong Disneyland will become the world's second Disney park to reopen. 
One of the smallest Disney theme parks, it closed on January 26 due to the global coronavirus crisis and has remained shut since then, with a few exceptions -- namely its hotels and a few on-site restaurants. 
Shanghai Disneyland was the first park to reopen, welcoming guests back on May 11. Its reopening gave clues as to what Disney parks around the world would look like post-coronavirus, with social distancing regulations enforced and both guests and employees (aka cast members) sporting face masks. 
And it looks like Hong Kong Disneyland will follow similar procedures.
Guests will be required to book reservations online at least one week in advance in order to maintain crowd control. Upon arrival, they will have to submit to temperature checks, fill out a health declaration form and wear face masks. 
Magic Access members, who are the park's annual pass holders, will get priority for booking reservations. 
""We are proud to be part of the Hong Kong community, which has worked hard and shown fortitude in how it has handled the pandemic,"" Stephanie Young, the park's managing director, said in a statement. 
Another major component of the Disney experience, character interactions, has changed for the coronavirus era. For now, guests won't be able to have up-close experiences like photo ops with Mickey, Minnie and company but will be able to enjoy socially distanced activities like parades and shows.
Since the virus was first identified in January, Hong Kong was quick to enact social hygiene measures. Currently, the city has recorded only 1,110 cases and just four deaths.
While waiting for crowds to return, Hong Kong Disneyland has been continuing work on its newest attraction, the Castle of Magical Dreams. Though it isn't complete yet, visitors will be able to see the castle's progress as it enters its final phase of construction.
Hong Kong Disneyland is also hard at work on a new ""Frozen"" themed section, with an area themed around Elsa, Anna, Olaf and the other characters from the current record holder for highest-grossing animated film ever.
Outside of greater China, though, Disney fans will still have to wait to get their theme park fix. Disney's parks in California, Florida, Japan and France are currently closed."

The news Wednesday came a day after the league announced the 2020 regular season will start in July, with the players' association accepting health and safety protocols to guide the return to play. The US on Tuesday also saw the third-highest number of new Covid-19 cases reported in one day since the pandemic began.
A Detroit Tigers player and a staff member outside the baseball operations department each tested positive for Covid-19, general manager Al Avila told reporters Wednesday. The player, who tested positive in the last few days, was in Florida but not at the team's spring training facility in Lakeland, Avila said, according to MLB.com.
""They're going through the process of recovering as we speak, and that's really all I can say about that at this point,"" Avila said, per MLB.com. ""It was just a few days ago, so they're still in the recovery stages, and at some point, they'll be tested again.""
The Seattle Mariners have had ""more than one"" player test positive for Covid-19, general manager Jerry Dipoto said Wednesday to reporters. 
""A lot of that is obviously going to be protected information, but we've had more than one player in our organization test positive,"" Dipoto said, according to MLB.com. 
""We're not yet sure, with testing coming this weekend, how much of that will affect our 40-man roster. But with the cases popping up, especially in some of the hot spots around the country, we have had a few players test positive,"" he said. 
""Right now they're asymptomatic. They feel great. But we are aware that they're positive, and obviously they'll not be in the environment when we open up until we've determined whether, A) they're part of the roster group, and B) they're healthy enough to be a part of that.""
A player on the Boston Red Sox's 40-man roster has tested positive for Covid-19, Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom told reporters Wednesday. The player was exposed to the virus a couple weeks ago, Bloom said, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. 
Blue Jays and Rockies also have positive cases
There are also positive Covid-19 cases stemming from testing last week at the Toronto Blue Jays facilities in Dunedin, Florida, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN on Wednesday. The source did not specify the number of positive cases and did not say if any of the positive cases are players
On Friday, the Blue Jays had said in a statement that they had closed the club's spring training facilities in Dunedin after a player experienced symptoms associated with Covid-19.
Three Colorado Rockies players tested positive for the coronavirus last week, according to multiple reports.
One player was symptomatic while the other two were asymptomatic, the reports say. 
Several Rockies players have been taking live at-bats and working out at the team's stadium, Coors Field, this month, according to the Denver Post.
The other players working out at the ballpark were tested for the virus and received negative test results, the Denver Post reports.
Colorado has not responded to CNN's request for comment."

This surge comes as President Jair Bolsonaro's spokesman, Gen. Otavio Santana do Rego Barros, confirmed he tested positive for Covid-19. 
Yet Bolsonaro said earlier this week he believed ""the worst had passed"" for the coronavirus pandemic, during a press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. But as the number of cases and deaths continue to climb, many health experts fear the worst is yet to come.
Since Bolsonaro made the comment in Brasilia on Tuesday, there have been more than 20,000 new cases of coronavirus and the country registered 610 deaths on Thursday, nearly the highest toll yet in a 24-hour period, according to the Health Ministry.
Health Minister Nelson Teich said Thursday that stricter lockdowns may be needed in some of the hardest-hit regions, during a video conference with members of the lower house of Congress. 
Former Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said ""the toughest months"" are likely to be May and June, during an interview with TV Globo last month, four days before he was fired by Bolsonaro over disagreements on the country's coronavirus strategy.
Warnings of a 'total collapse'
Meanwhile, Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat coronavirus presents to the country's 209 million citizens, repeatedly saying he believes the effects of preventive measures, such as quarantines and lockdowns, could have a worse impact on Brazil's economy. 
During a speech at the Supreme Court on Thursday, Bolsonaro and Finance Minister Paulo Guedes said the economy could suffer a ""total collapse"" if the country doesn't reopen.
""The issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can't let the side-effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,"" Bolsonaro said.
On March 24, Bolsonaro compared the coronavirus to a ""little flu"" in an address to the nation. Less than two months after that comment, there have been more than 132,000 new cases of Covid-19. 
It was followed by a series of controversial statements about the virus by Bolsonaro. ""Brazilians don't catch anything ... they already have the antibodies to keep it from spreading,"" the President has said.
He added again that Brazilians are likely to be immune to the coronavirus during a March 26 press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. ""Brazilians should be studied, we don't catch anything. You see people jumping in sewage, diving in it and nothing happens to them,"" Bolsonaro said.
During the same press conference, Bolsonaro said he believed many Brazilians had already been infected but that those people already had ""the antibodies that would help [coronavirus] not spread.""
The comments were made two weeks after Bolsonaro's press secretary Fabio Wajngarten and other Cabinet members tested positive for coronavirus, after traveling to the US and meeting with President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago.
The World Health Organization said last month there was no evidence that people who have had Covid-19 will not get it a second time.
Bolsonaro says he has been tested twice for coronavirus and both tests came back negative, according to posts on his personal Twitter and Facebook pages. Congressional leaders and a Federal judge are now asking the President to show evidence that the test came back negative, after he recently implied he may have contracted the virus without knowing it.
Social distancing is 'useless,' Bolsonaro claims
Bolsonaro recently reiterated his claims that efforts to flatten the curve of the virus's spread -- via quarantine measures and social distancing -- were ineffective.
""From the looks of it, from what we're going to see now, this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless,"" Bolsonaro said during a Facebook live on April 30th. ""Now, the collateral damage from all of that will be unemployment."" 
Bolsonaro has repeatedly pushed back against quarantine and stay-at-home orders imposed by governors in some of the hardest-hit states, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, during press conferences and via Twitter.
He's also participated in two so-called ""anti-lockdown"" protests outside Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia, where supporters crowded outside the gates and crammed against each other for a chance to see the President.
The latest protest took place last Sunday, May 3. In a live video posted to his personal Facebook account, Bolsonaro appeared without a mask shaking some people's hands and waving at the crowd. Banners calling for military intervention and for the takedown of Congress and Supreme Court have been seen at the protests in the past.
Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria said Bolsonaro's participation in the protests were anti-democratic. 
""President Jair Bolsonaro reveals, once again, his disdain for democracy,"" Doria said in a series of tweets posted to his personal Twitter account Sunday. ""On top of that, he's encouraging the people from his country to disobey health and medicine.""
Bolsonaro and Doria have butted heads over measures to reopen the country, including during a video conference on coronavirus response that included other governors.
""We have to have a president to lead and drive the country, not to divide it,"" Doria said during the March 25 call. Bolsonaro accused Doria of letting his own presidential ambitions ""go to his head"" and said he is an ""example for no one.""
The state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and home to the country's financial capital, has registered the highest number of cases and deaths. At least 39,000 cases and 3,206 deaths have been confirmed in Sao Paulo, according to the latest data from the state's health secretariat. 
The state issued a new mandate Thursday, which makes mandatory the use of face masks in public spaces, including ride-share vehicles. The state government did not specify for how long the measure will remain in place.
The state is scheduled to begin a gradual reopening plan on May 11, according to an announcement made by Doria last month. It's still unclear which businesses will be allowed to resume activities under that plan.
'What do you want me to do?'
Bolsonaro gave a late-night press conference outside the Alvorada presidential palace on April 28, the day when Brazil's death toll surpassed those reported in China.
A reporter asked Bolsonaro about the spike, to which he responded: ""So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?"" He added that even though his middle name is ""Messias,"" which translates as ""Messiah"" in English, he's not ""a miracle worker.""
He later walked back the comments during the same press conference, saying ""I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow.""
Brazilians in several major cities, including the capital Brasilia, protested the comments by banging pots and pans out their windows and yelling ""get out of here"" after the press conference was broadcast.
While Sao Paulo's numbers are the highest, many poorer states in the North and Northeastern part of the country have been heavily affected.
The comments came the same week the country's Supreme Court authorized an investigation into allegations Bolsonaro sought to interfere with police investigations following the resignation of his Justice Minister, Sergio Moro.
A recent survey from pollster Datafolha, showed Bolsonaro's approval at 33% and that the country is split nearly down the middle on whether the President should be impeached."

Herbert says he only had a 20% chance of survival, and needed to be placed in a medically induced coma. His doctors urged him to call his family for what could be his last goodbye. 
It had all started innocuously enough -- a cough and fever. After that, however, his illness took off. Within a week, he was on a breathing machine in the ICU because of a life-threatening lung infection from Covid-19.
His wife Heidi and two daughters painfully remember the next six days when Herbert was unconscious -- wondering if and how they could be at his bedside during a strict no-visitor hospital policy, just to hold his hand in what might be his last days. 
Herbert's rapid worsening was even jarring for his medical team caring for him. ""It was certainly unusual how quickly he went from a period of apparent stability to requiring ventilatory support,"" said Dr. Neal Greenfield, a critical care physician who helped care for Michael at Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Illinois.
But as quickly as Herbert got worse, he then recovered. His doctors reduced his sedation, and with his regained consciousness, Herbert video-called his family every day. Unable to speak with a breathing tube, he would sign, ""I love you.""
He was taken off of his ventilator on his mother's birthday -- a week earlier than expected -- and he gave his mom the best birthday gift a son could give. 
""I was able to call her and just say, ""Hi,"" and then I was able to FaceTime my girls and wife, which was wonderful,"" he said.
 Herbert was released from the hospital a few days later. His cough and fever improved. On paper, he would be listed as recovered, but as we are learning, the aftermath of Covid-19 is not nearly as straightforward as once believed.
Tracking for a disease with little information
""Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind. We were dealing with the crisis,"" said Dr. Reynold Panettieri, vice chancellor of clinical and translational science and a pulmonary critical care physician at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
While most patients with Covid-19 will fully recover, data from China suggest that some patients, especially those who had more severe infections, may face lasting -- even permanent -- damage to their bodies.
To better understand these effects, Panettieri is leading a six-month study of recovered Covid-19 patients. So far, his research group has enrolled more than 800 participants.
""Now, we'll start to see what the long-term consequences are,"" Panettieri said. ""And that is an issue that will really need to be addressed.""
Unlike most viral diseases, which may result in a nagging cough for weeks, Panettieri has observed that some patients recovering from Covid-19 have other serious symptoms that won't go away. 
""They had an illness for about two weeks, and three months later, they're still not feeling 'quite right,'"" he said. ""They were aggressive athletes or were exercising and...they still haven't gotten back to that prowess that they were pre-illness.""
He said this could be related to a number of factors, including how the virus affects the lungs, heart and muscles.
For Michael Herbert, his doctors believe his lingering cough and shortness of breath are likely remnants of his serious bout of pneumonia. Despite leaving the hospital a month ago, Herbert still struggles to recover back to how he felt before getting sick.
Dangerous lung scarring reminiscent of SARS and MERS
While a longer recovery course might be expected for someone such as Herbert who faced a more severe illness, there's also concern for more permanent lung damage, according to Dr. Ronald DePinho, professor and past president of MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-founder of Tvardi Therapeutics. DePinho is particularly worried that the immune response to Covid-19 may cause irreversible scarring known as pulmonary fibrosis. 
Pulmonary fibrosis can be a ""relentlessly progressive"" disease of the lungs in which patients can become dependent on oxygen or even ultimately require lung transplants, he said. Again, this is after a patient is thought to have ""recovered.""
Though it's too early to know whether patients with the novel coronavirus will develop this sort of lung scarring, studies in other related coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, suggests certain Covid-19 patients may have lasting fibrosis. One study following 36 MERS patients found a third still had lung fibrosis on chest x-rays after a median follow-up of 43 days.
And up to two-thirds of patients with SARS who were sick enough to require hospitalization also developed pulmonary fibrosis, according to DePinho. If the same pattern holds true for Covid-19, that could mean many thousands of people will have long-term lung scarring, he said.
The data from China thus far is still thin, but the early results follow the same pattern DePinho is describing. In a study of 63 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan, China, about 18% had ""fibrous stripes"" on CT scans. And in another study, it took more than 6 weeks for one patient's chest CT to return to normal, even though his symptoms had already improved.
This might explain why some patients have significant drops in their lung function even after recovering from the novel coronavirus. Losses in lung function could be as high as 20 to 30 percent, the medical director of infectious diseases at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong told a media briefing in March.
More on Covid-19 and the lungs
There is another factor that may be driving long-term issues with the lungs, unrelated to scarring or fibrosis. We are learning those with Covid-19 also can form blood clots at an abnormally high rate. In rare situations, a clot that has formed in the deep veins of the legs may travel to the lungs -- known as a pulmonary embolism. This is what happened to Warnell Vega, a healthy 33-year-old I interviewed with Covid-19 who survived a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and is now home in recovery.
As is often the case, Vega developed a pulmonary embolism with little or no warning. He only had a mild cough when he passed out in his bathroom. He woke up in an ICU at Mount Sinai hospital. He was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19, after which a scan revealed a pulmonary embolism. His doctors told me that Vega became critically ill and developed signs of pulmonary hypertension, which happens 2-4% of the time in patients with a PE (pulmonary embolism). So far Vega told me he feels close to normal, but recent clinical studies have shown that close to half of patients who suffered a pulmonary embolism will still experience exercise limitations at one year.
Given his history of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism, Vega is at risk of developing a blood clot again, and may need to be on blood thinners for some time as he continues to recover. 
Blood thinners in general might improve outcomes for hospitalized patients with Covid-19, according to a report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The team at Mount Sinai conducting the study found 29% of patients on ventilators who were provided blood thinners died, compared to 63% of patients on ventilators who were not given blood thinners. The improvement in mortality rates with blood thinners might demonstrate how dangerous blood clots from Covid-19 are. 
Another significant risk factor for a successful recovery is the impact of this virus on the heart. The virus' impact on the lungs may eventually lead to less oxygenated blood reaching the heart. Ot the virus may attack the heart itself, leading to myocarditis -- inflammation of the heart muscle. Both can lead to chronic heart damage, even in the previously healthy.
""There have been a number of reported cardiac complications associated with the Covid virus and they're so varied,"" said Dr. Joseph Brennan, the director of the coronary intensive care unit at Yale University School of Medicine.
He said there are a couple ways to look at how Covid-19 could cause long-term effects on the heart. One way is the direct impact of the virus on the heart, and the other is how clotting from Covid could lead to heart attacks. 
""We are all aware that heart attacks may have long-term consequences because of a potential and permanent decline in heart function,"" he said. ""Those that have had...heart attacks associated with the Covid virus will more than likely have long-term consequences.""
A study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology found 19.7% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients suffered from some type of cardiac injury. Such patients might not be able to exercise as much, feel breathless or feel like their heart is beating faster than usual for an indefinite period of time. In general, a faster heart rate will likely be a common side effect in the long run for Covid-19 patients, especially if patients have underlying lung issues from Covid-19, he said.
Though Michael Herbert did not have heart-related complications from Covid-19, he did suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity -- conditions that affect heart health and put him at risk for a more severe infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Another important organ at risk for damage from blood clots? The brain. Large clots would more likely cause obvious symptoms, but smaller ones may lead to a type of dementia known as vascular dementia. Both can cause permanent damage that might not present itself until years down the line.
""We know that if someone has a stroke, it approximately doubles their risk of getting dementia later in life,"" said Dr. Marion Buckwalter, associate professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Stanford University. ""[Our research group] discovered that people who had a more vigorous immune response by day two after stroke were more likely to have cognitive decline in the first year after stroke."" 
Michael Herbert feels lucky that he hasn't experienced these types of symptoms during his recovery, especially given how severe his infection was. 
""I'm feeling good,"" Michael said. ""My strength has come back. It's not perfect, but I feel better.""
 Though his progress has been incremental, he remains encouraged that each day has been a step in the right direction. He remembers how weak he felt trying to move from his ICU bed to a wheelchair. Now, he is working towards walking two miles a day without stopping.
The entire ordeal has been a huge wake up call for him -- he now takes his health much more seriously, and he is grateful that his doctors have provided him a second chance.
""I mean, I have bonus time here in life,"" he said. ""I was supposed to be dead, and I didn't die. I'm not going to waste any days I have left."""

The Springfield-Greene Health Department announced Saturday that a second hairstylist tested positive for coronavirus, and may have exposed 56 clients at the same Great Clips salon. 
A day earlier, it had said another hairstylist with coronavirus at the same salon potentially exposed 84 customers and seven coworkers. 
Both stylists had symptoms while at work, officials said. They did not provide details on the symptoms they had or when they tested positive. 
The case highlights the dangers of community spread in the United States as businesses reopen after weeks of restrictions to combat the spread of coronavirus. 
The stylists and clients wore face coverings
Both stylists worked from the second week of May to Wednesday. The clients and the stylists all wore face coverings, the Health Department said. At the time, businesses like barbershops and hair salons were allowed to operate in the state. 
 ""It is the hope of the department that because face coverings were worn throughout this exposure timeline, no additional cases will result,"" it added.
The salon kept impeccable records that made contact tracing possible, said Clay Goddard, director of the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.
But he cautioned about the risks of overwhelming resources. 
""I'm going to be honest with you: We can't have many more of these,"" he said at a news conference. ""We can't make this a regular habit or our capabilities as a community will be strained.""
Goddard said he was pleased with the deep cleaning measures taken by Great Clips, adding that he now considers the business safe. 
""The well-being of Great Clips customers and stylists in the salon is our top priority and proper sanitization has always been an important cosmetology industry practice for Great Clips salons. We've closed the salon where the employee works and it's currently undergoing additional sanitizing and deep cleaning,"" the owners of the business said in a statement to CNN affiliate KYTV.

So how did it become one of the hardest hit?",https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/americas/peru-covid-hotspot-why-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200525154900-peru-covid-hotspot-why-super-tease.jpg,2020-05-25T22:29:07Z,"(CNN)Peru was one of the first nations in the Americas to take strict preventative coronavirus measures, like stay-at-home orders, curfews and border closings. So how did it become one of the hardest hit?
As of Monday, Peru had more than 119,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 3,400 deaths -- putting it second only to Brazil both in number of cases and deaths in Latin America. 
The two countries had handled the epidemic entirely differently: While Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed the dangers posed by the coronavirus, Peru's President Martin Vizcarra declared on March 15 a nationwide state of emergency that included mandatory self-quarantine, and shuttered the country's borders. 
But the virus surged all the same. 
More than 85% of Peru's ICU beds with ventilators are currently occupied, according to government figures, and overcrowding at hospitals is feared. 
""This situation is not just a health emergency, but a health catastrophe, defined as a situation where the pandemic has overtaken the response capacity of the health sector,"" Dr. Alfredo Celis of the Medical College of Peru told CNN en Español.
How did a country that responded assertively and seriously to the pandemic end up like this? 
Needs vs. quarantine measures 
The deep inequality in Peru is one reason, according to Dr. Elmer Huerta, a Peruvian doctor and contributor to CNN en Español. ""What I have learned is that this virus lays bare the socio-economic conditions of a place,"" he said. 
Many of Peru's poor have no choice but to venture outside their homes for work, food or even banking transactions. 
For example, only 49% of Peruvian households own a refrigerator or freezer (61% in urban areas), according to the country's 2017 Census. This translates to a need for many to visit markets daily for food because they can't stock up, Huerta said. 
""You're supposed to avoid human contact in a society where one can't stay at home,"" Huerta said. 
On April 14 -- about a month after Peru enacted its mandatory stay-at-home policy and implemented a curfew -- CNN affiliate TV Peru showed images outside of a market on the outskirts of Lima. Shoppers waited in line for hours and a large mass of people milled about. Most wore masks, but social distancing seemed impossible. 
""We must endure (the crowds) because there is no other way,"" one woman standing in line told TV Peru. ""If not, we will not have food. We have nothing to eat, that's why we have come here."" 
On that day, the tally of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country was 10,303. Today, it is 10 times higher. 
People have also ended up crowding at banks as they attempted to access coronavirus relief funds.
The government's stimulus package to help millions of Peru's most vulnerable families was a good idea, but its distribution was poorly designed, said Kristian Lopez Vargas, a Peruvian economist and assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
In a report last year, the agency that regulates Peru's banks reported that only about 38% of adults have a bank account. The lack of access to the financial system means a majority of aid recipients have to go in person to the banks to obtain their money. 
""It was not hard to anticipate people's behavior in their attempt to access this aid,"" Lopez Vargas told CNN. ""Instead, these policies caused unnecessary harm by inducing people to gather in large crowds in banks.""
Many Peruvians also live and work in ways that simply can't be reconciled with social distancing, he pointed out. According to Lopez Vargas, more than 30% of households in Peru live in overcrowded conditions, with four or more people sleeping in the same room.
And more than 72% work in the informal economy, according to Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information. For those living day-to-day in the informal sector, earning an income oftentimes depends on going out to work and not self-isolating. 
This, combined with the needs of millions to obtain food and other items from crowded markets, ""was an explosive mix,"" Lopez Vargas said. 
On Friday, President Vizcarra extended the state of emergency until June 30, keeping in place the mandatory self-quarantine and curfews across the country. It was the fifth time the emergency measures have been extended. But this time, the extension was paired with authorization for certain businesses to re-open, including services like salons, food delivery and dentistry. 
Peru's priorities for enforcing health guidelines also appear to have evolved since the state of emergency was first declared. In early April, Vizcarra reported that during the first weeks of the stay-at-home mandate, as many as 3,000 people were detained for disobeying the measures on some days. On Monday, he announced that the priority is now on enforcing health protocols at the country's markets. 
One lesson learned from the pandemic response is that people must change certain ""social behaviors that have done much damage,"" he added.
""This kind of behavior is individualistic, selfish...ignoring what's happening around us, and precisely what has brought this situation upon us, not just in Peru, but the whole world,"" said Vizcarra. 
But Huerta, the doctor, and Lopez Vargas, the economist, caution against placing too much blame on the people. The underlying problems that the pandemic has laid bare are not new. 
""While it may seem like a mystery to some, it's not,"" Lopez Vargas said.

In a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, Fauci noted that children tend to have milder symptoms or even no symptoms when they are infected with Covid-19. 
What's not yet clear is whether children get infected as frequently as adults, and whether they often pass the infection on to others. Ultimately, he said, the decision to reopen schools needs to be predicated on the level of infection in each community.
In the past academic school year, 48 states recommended schools close through the rest of the year as coronavirus began its rapid spread. 
Some, including schools in Montana and Idaho, opened their doors again for a few weeks before the academic school year finished with the thought of gaining experience in reopening that could be used in the fall.
""I hesitate to make any broad statements about whether it is or is not quote 'safe' for kids to come back to school,"" Fauci told CNN. 
""When you talk about children going back to school and their safety, it really depends on the level of viral activity, and the particular area that you're talking about. What happens all too often, understandably, but sometimes misleadingly, is that we talk about the country as a whole in a unidimensional way."" 
Fauci seemed to think that keeping schools closed in general was not necessary.
""Children can get infected, so, yes, so you've got to be careful,"" Fauci said. ""You got to be careful for them and you got to be careful that they may not spread it. Now, to make an extrapolation that you shouldn't open schools, I think is a bit of a reach.""
Fauci said it's not premature to start the conversation about reopening schools now. ""I think we need to discuss the pros and the cons of bringing kids back to school in September,"" he said.
Stressing the importance of not generalizing, Fauci laid out the spectrum of scenarios for what a return to school in the fall could look like.
""In some situations there will be no problem for children to go back to school,"" he said. ""In others, you may need to do some modifications. You know, modifications could be breaking up the class so you don't have a crowded classroom, maybe half in the morning, half in the afternoon, having children doing alternate schedules. There's a whole bunch of things that one can do.""
Talking about classroom layouts specifically, Fauci underscored the need to ""be creative"" and create plans based on the degree of infection in the community. 
He suggested that one option is to space out children at every other desk, or every third desk in order to maintain proper social distancing.
Study underway on how Covid-19 affects children
Fauci said the same type of creativity would need to be applied to how students get to and from school.
While the conversation about how schools can safely reopen continues, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, launched a study last month to examine further how Covid-19 affects children. 
The study will follow 6,000 people, both children and their families, chosen from 11 cities over the course of six months, to get further clarification on whether children are less likely to catch coronavirus than adults.
""We don't know that for absolutely certain right now,"" Fauci said.
Fauci said his team will likely not see results from the study until December."

22 with 17 posters participating
The lackluster federal response to the COVID-19 crisis has become even lighter on details in recent days, as the administration pushes hard on a message of ""reopening"" while leaving out any data or expertise that might conflict with that focus. 
The White House has done everything possible to minimize messaging that might scare Americans into staying home and instead ""relies on tightly controlling information"" about the novel coronavirus disease, the Washington Post reports.
A source the Post described as a senior administration official told the paper that the task force addressing the crisis was already meeting less often before President Donald Trump said Wednesday its focus would be shifting away from emergency management and toward economic reopening. Public health warnings are scaring people, the source added, so the administration has been downplaying them.
The White House expressly prohibited task force members from accepting invitations to Congressional hearings, following a request from a House subcommittee. Members of the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, are however scheduled to testify before the Senate this month about the administration's response. Trump on Tuesday told reporters the difference is one of politics, saying, ""The House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters."" 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which one would ordinarily expect to be heavily involved in managing a pandemic, has been kept quiet since March. The agency's last press briefing on the novel coronavirus was March 9, when about 20 people in the US were known to have died due to COVID-19. As of today, more than 75,000 people in the US have died as a result of the disease.
Yesterday, the AP made public a leaked 17-page reopening guide put together by the CDC. Administration officials allegedly told the CDC its report, which included detailed guidelines for industries such as restaurants and child care, would ""never see the light of day.""
The void made by the absence of CDC press conferences has instead been filled with messaging directly from the White House, such as Trump's infamously questionable suggestion to America to consider injections of bleach or other disinfectants to cure the disease. (A reminder: Do not do this.) In the past week, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has taken over the briefings, and she continues to push the administration's messaging about economic recovery.
Experts have argued that states are not ready for phased reopening under the current plans made public by the administration, but governors in states such as Georgia and Texas have continued with rapid reopening efforts this week undeterred.
The administration seems comfortable with the human cost of sweeping expertise aside. The president agreed in an interview earlier this week that ""there'll be more death"" in the US from a rapid reopening. ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon,"" Trump told ABC News. 
Denial, however, has not proved a mitigating strategy for handling COVID-19 in the White House or elsewhere. The disease continues to spread nationwide, and that includes inside the Administration. At least three staffers who work directly with Trump or Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the disease in the past 24 hours, including Trump's valet and Pence spokesperson Katie Miller, who is also married to White House adviser Stephen Miller."

Two closely related anti-malarial drugs championed by President Donald Trump as promising treatments for COVID-19 appear to substantially increase the risks of death and heart complications in patients hospitalized from the disease.
Thats according to the largest study yet on the topic, which involved more than 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients on six continents. The peer-reviewed study, appearing Friday in The Lancet, was led by Mandeep Mehra, a professor of medicine at Harvard.
The drugs studied included chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as malaria. Early laboratory work suggested that they also have potent anti-viral properties. But small clinical studies looking into potential benefits for COVID-19 patients have largely provided mixed and inconclusive results to this point.
Still, some of those small, uncontrolled studies suggesting benefits have gained traction and have led to undue optimism that the drugs can treat the pandemic disease. President Trump in particular has touted the drugs, calling them a game changer, even this week telling reporters that he is taking hydroxychloroquine. A couple of weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think its good; Ive heard a lot of good stories, he said Monday, May 18.
That revelation goes against a recent announcement by the US Food and Drug Administration that the drugs ""should be limited to clinical trial settings or for treating certain hospitalized patients."" The FDA made the recommendation in light of reports of potentially fatal heart rhythm problems linked to the drugs, which have been given at higher doses than those used for autoimmune and malaria patients.
Sobering stats
The new, large study out today seems to bolster those concernsand deflate overblown hopes.
Mehra and colleagues looked at the medical records of more than 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 671 hospitals in various countries. Their average age was about 54, and about 54 percent were male.
Of the patients, nearly 15,000 had received one of four treatments involving one of the drugs1,868 received chloroquine, 3,783 received chloroquine with a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin), 3,016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6,221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (a combination Trump has also promoted). Over 81,000 other hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study did not receive any of these regimens and were considered a control group.The researchers primarily looked at risks of in-hospital deaths and serious heart arrhythmias.
Comparing the treatment groups to controls and adjusting each patients risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, the researchers found the following:
<ul><li>COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine alone had a 34-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 137-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide had a 45-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 411-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given chloroquine had a 37-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 256-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li><li>Those given chloroquine and a macrolide had a 37-percent increased risk of dying in the hospital and a 301-percent increased risk of developing a serious arrhythmia.</li></ul>Mehra and colleagues conclude:
In this large multinational real-world analysis, we did not observe any benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (when used alone or in combination with a macrolide) on in-hospital outcomes, when initiated early after diagnosis of COVID-19. Each of the drug regimens of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with a macrolide was associated with an increased hazard for clinically significant occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19.
The study has some significant limitations, including that it is merely an observational studynot a randomized, controlled trial thought of as a gold standard for assessing treatments. As an observational study, it cannot prove cause and effect; it only reveals associations with the treatments. Randomized trialsseveral of which are currently underwayare still needed to definitely determine risks and benefits of the drug.
While the researchers tried to adjust for patients differing risk factors, it's possible that other, unmeasured factors influenced the course of their illnesses. Also, the findings dont speak to risks or outcomes for patients who are not hospitalized with COVID-19 and have milder or asymptomatic infections.
Despite the limitations, experts still say the study is enlightening. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine highlighted in a statement to media that the study may have biases and inadequate adjustments for risks, but it can be stated with some confidence that it is unlikely that the randomized trials will find substantial benefit to these drugs, and the excess in heart rhythm problems is consistent with everything we know about them.
He continued: A definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomized trials, but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for treatment of COVID-19 other than in the context of a randomized trial. It might even be said that to go on giving them other than in a trial is unethical, given this evidence that is not yet contradicted by other available evidence.
Babak Javid, an infectious disease expert at Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing, said in a statement that the study certainly casts a great deal of doubt whether these agents are effective in the setting in which these drugs are currently being used in COVID-19 patients: i.e. severely ill patients in hospital.

An expert with the World Health Organization on Monday made brief comments about asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 that sparked a firestorm of confusion, backlash, and criticism.
Some public health experts were quick to lash out at the organization for poor messaging. Others tried to clarify what the WHO expert might have been trying to say. And still others quickly impeached evidence-based strategies to combat the pandemic virus.
On Tuesday, the WHO responded with a live Q&amp;A on social media to address confusion and lingering questions about transmission. In it, the WHO expert who made the confusing comments on Monday tried to clarify the issue and add context and caveats. But the response may still leave some confused and frustrated.
Here, well try to clear the air around what was said, what maybe should have been said, and what we do and dont know about transmission of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
What we know
First and foremost: people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but do not have symptoms canand dospread the virus to other people. To put it another way: people who seem healthy and do not have classic COVID-19 symptoms may actually be infected and can still pass on the virus to other people, infecting them.
We know this is possible, and we know that it happens. No public health expert is saying otherwiseincluding those at the WHO.
Moreover, we know that there are two scenarios in which this can happen.
Some people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will never develop symptoms from their infectionthat is, from the time they are infected with the virus to the time that the virus is no longer reproducing in their cells and, thus, they are no longer infected. The WHO considers these cases asymptomatic. If asymptomatic people spread the virus to someone else during their silent infection, that spread would be considered asymptomatic transmission.
In the other scenario, people who are infected and initially do not have symptoms later go on to develop symptoms, sometimes very mild ones. In fact, data suggests that a person can test positive for the infection one to three days before symptoms develop. Symptoms tend to develop between five to six days after an exposure to the virus, but it can take as long as 14 days. Studies have found that viral sheddinghow much infectious virus particles are spewing out of an infected personappears to be highest in the few days around the first day of symptoms.
That means that infected people can test positive for the virus and spread the virus to others before their symptoms develop.
So far, so good
Heres where this gets confusing.
Regardless of when in the course of an infection an infected person develops symptoms, they are considered to have a symptomatic case overall.
But if they test positive while they have no symptoms and then go on to develop symptoms, they would be considered pre-symptomatic at the time of the testing. But, if theres no follow-up with the case to know if they ever develop symptoms, they could be misclassified as asymptomatic.
If they spread the virus to someone else while they are pre-symptomatic, that could be considered pre-symptomatic transmission OR asymptomatic transmission because they were asymptomatic at the time of transmission.
Im using could in these sentences because different experts and studies use these terms differently. See how confusing this is?
Then, of course, there are the straight symptomatic cases that we understand very well. From these cases, its clear that SARS-CoV-2 spreads in large respiratory droplets, launched out of a mouth or nose from sneezing, coughing, loud talking, or heavy breathing. We know that the these droplets tend to not go farther than one to two meters away from an infected person. So, the most effective way to prevent this type of transmission is to keep physical distance from others who may be infected. When physical distancing is not possible, experts recommend a face mask.
So, to sum up:
Symptomatic case = Someone who is infected and has symptoms, at some point.
Asymptomatic case = Someone who is infected but never develops symptoms.
Pre-symptomatic = The phase of a symptomatic infection when a person may test positive for the virus and/or may spread the virus but has not yet developed symptoms.
Pre-symptomatic transmission = Spread of the virus from a symptomatic case during their pre-symptomatic phase.
Asymptomatic transmission = Spread of the virus from an infected person with no current symptoms. This transmission could be from a pre-symptomatic person or a truly asymptomatic case, depending on how the terms are being used.
The WHO has consistently used asymptomatic transmission only when talking about truly asymptomatic cases.
What we dont know
Theres a lot about transmission we dont know.
For one thing, we dont have a clear picture of how many infected people have symptomatic cases and how many have asymptomatic cases. Estimates of the percentage of cases that are asymptomatic vary wildly, with some ranging from 4 percent to 45 percent.
From there, were not certain which types of cases are transmitting the infection and whenthat is, we dont know what proportion of asymptomatic cases spread the infection to others. Some data suggest a small fractionsuch as 6.4 percentof asymptomatic cases transmit the virus, while other modeling data estimates that 40 percent of all transmission in the pandemic is from asymptomatic cases.
For symptomatic cases, we dont know what proportion is spreading the infection before they develop symptoms. This, too, has a large range of estimates.
The WHO has held that, according to its view of the data, symptomatic cases still appear to be behind the majority of new infections, whether that occurs during the pre-symptomatic phase or not. As such, the organization pushes the proven strategies of isolating symptomatic cases and tracing, quarantining, and testing contacts.
What the WHO initially said
Amid all this uncertainty and confusion, the issue of asymptomatic transmission came up in a regular WHO press conference Monday, June 8.
A reporter with Reuters noted that a Singapore health official had reported that nearly half of new cases there appeared to be asymptomatic. The reporter asked the WHO whether its possible that [asymptomatic cases] have a bigger role than the WHO initially thought in propagating the pandemic and what the policy implications of that might be?
WHOs COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, provided the notorious response (transcript here).
Kerkhovewho is an epidemiologistfirst tried to define the case terms aboveasymptomatic, pre-symptomaticand explain that the WHO doesnt take the use of the term asymptomatic at face value. But her response was muddled and fragmented.
In a number of countries when we go back and we discuss with them, one, how are these asymptomatic cases being identified, many of them are being identified through contact tracing, which is what we want to see, that you have a known case, you find your contacts, theyre already in quarantine hopefully and some of them are tested, she said. Then you pick up people who may have asymptomatic or no symptoms or even mild symptoms.
The other thing were finding is that when we go back and say, how many of them were truly asymptomatic we find out that many have really mild disease, theyre notquote, unquoteCOVID symptoms meaning they may not have developed ever yet, they may not have had a significant cough or they may not have shortness of breath but some may have mild disease."

The World Health Organization on Wednesday announced that it is abandoning use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trialthe organizations massive, global clinical trial of potential COVID-19 treatments.
The WHO cited early data from the trial and others showing that hydroxychloroquine does not lower the risk of death or provide any other clinical benefit in hospitalized patients.
Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial, the WHO said in a statement. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician.
The decision comes just two days after the US Food and Drug Administration revoked its Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine. The EUA had allowed doctors in the United States to prescribe the drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials.
Like the WHO, the FDA made its decision to revoke the EUA  based on early trial data that showed no evidence of benefit for mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation.
One of the main sources of that data is the Recovery Trial, a large, randomized trial in the UK run by researchers at the University of Oxford. On June 5, the lead investigators of the trial announced they were halting the use of hydroxychloroquine after reviewing early data.
A total of 1,542 patients were randomized to hydroxychloroquine and compared with 3,132 patients randomized to usual care alone, they reported. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality (25.7% hydroxychloroquine vs. 23.5% usual care; hazard ratio 1.11 [95% confidence interval 0.98-1.26]; p=0.10). There was also no evidence of beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes.
These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, they concluded.
Promising start
Hydroxychloroquinewhich is approved for use against malaria and autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritisappeared to have some anti-viral activity in early laboratory testing. Its also thought to have immune-modulating affects, which have been hypothesized to be helpful in treating severe cases of COVID-19. But evidence to support its use in the coronavirus pandemic has always been thin; early trials produced mixed and inconclusive findings of effectiveness against COVID-19.
Still, the drug rose to prominence and became politicized after being repeatedly touted by US President Donald Trump, who called it a game changer and even told reporters that he was taking it as a prophylactic.
Muddling the issue, a high-profile study in The Lancet reported that not only was hydroxychloroquine ineffective, it increased rates of death and heart-rhythm complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Though heart-rhythm complications are a known risk of hydroxychloroquine, the findings were determined to be based on a dubious dataset from an equally dubious data analytics company. The study has been retracted.
But, with data from reputable studies coming out, its becoming clearer that hydroxychloroquine is, unfortunately, not effective at treating COVID-19.
Other trials are still ongoing to assess whether it could prevent an infection with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The WHO noted in its announcement todays decision to end hydroxycloroquines use in the Solidarity trial, which looks at stopping COVID-19, does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.
However, results from those trials are not looking good either. One recently published study involving 821 people who had been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 found taking hydroxychloroquine after exposure did not prevent people from becoming ill. According to Science magazine, a Spanish study on post-exposure prophylaxis involving 2,300 people also found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine.
The WHOs Solidarity trial will carry on with the other potential treatments for COVID-19, which include the HIV treatment lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, and interferon beta-1a. The Solidarity trial is enrolling thousands of COVID-19 patients in over 400 hospitals in 35 counties."

Maryland reported its highest number of new COVID-19 cases on Tuesdayjust four days after the state began easing public health restrictions aimed at thwarting the spread of disease.
Though state officials note that an increase in testing and a backlog of test results may partly explain the spike, case counts overall suggest that disease transmission is not on the declineand transmission could very easily increase as residents begin venturing into public spaces more frequently.
Marylands outcome may hold lessons for other states attempting their own reopening. As of today, May 20, all 50 states have begun easing restrictions at some level, according to The Washington Post.
In Maryland, officials reported 1,784 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. That figure surpasses the previous highest daily toll on May 1 of 1,730 new cases. Otherwise, the states other high daily tolls are around 1,200 new cases.
In the 24-hour period in which the spike was reported, the Old Line State also reported that 5,368 people had tested negative, according to NPR. That means that about 25 percent of tests from that time frame were positive for the disease.
Health experts generally consider a positive rate of 10 percent or less as a benchmark indicating that an area is performing enough testing and has a good handle on the state of an outbreak.
Despite the new cases and the fact that it is under a state of emergency, Maryland began reopening businesses last Friday. Retailers, churches, and hair salons were allowed to reopen at 50-percent capacity under a Safer at Home policy.
Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the decision given that hospitalizations and hospital bed occupancy were either stable or in decline, as NPR noted. He also said the state had the means to perform contact tracing for up to 1,000 cases per daya figure that was significantly surpassed on Tuesday.
In total, Maryland has confirmed over 42,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths. Many of those are in a corridor stretching from Baltimore to Washington, DC. Montgomery County, Maryland, which borders Northwest DC, reported 533 of the states 1,784 new cases Tuesday, for instance.
The DC metro area in particular has had a hard time shaking the outbreak. Reuters reported Tuesday that a senior White House official said that the DC metro areaalong with Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolisremains in an unexpected plateau of COVID-19 transmission."

As deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic begin to plateau and slowly decline in some parts of Europe and the United States, the devastation is reaching a fever pitch in Latin America.
Death tolls in cities and areas of Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador are reaching alarming levelsin some places five-times higher than normal death ratesaccording to an analysis by The New York Times.
While some of the official death tolls from the pandemic remain low, a review of mortality data by the Times reveals significant increases. The death counts include those directly from COVID-19 and also those from other causeswhich in some cases may be due in part to people not being able to receive a standard level of care while health systems are overwhelmed during the pandemic.
In the last two months, deaths in Lima, Peru, doubled over historical averages. In Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas in Brazil, deaths for April reached about 2,800three times the historical average. Gravediggers in the city reportedly stacked coffins three layers deep into mass graves to try to keep up with the body count.
In the port city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, deaths spiked to five-times the averagean increase comparable to the spike in deaths seen in New York City during the worst of its outbreak. Residents in Guayaquil were reportedly forced to leave dead bodies in cardboard boxes on the streets for days.
SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, was slow to make its way to Latin America. But despite its delayed arrival, many areas have struggled to prepare. Guatemala and Haiti have only around 100 ventilators between them, according to an article last month in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Mexico, the article also noted, has high rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which are risk factors for severe disease.
It is a very difficult situation, Alfonso Rodríguez-Morales, from Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases, told the journal. Obviously the healthcare systems are not trained for coronavirus; we had a little extra time to get ready for the arrival of the disease but some places are really going to struggle.
Theres also been issues with messaging. In February, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that COVID-19 was not even as bad as the flu. Brazils president, Jair Bolsonaro, had been dismissive of the death toll and the need for social distancing. When asked recently about the countrys mounting death toll, he responded: So what? Im sorry. What do you want me to do? according to the Times.
Nicaragua, meanwhile, has refused to impose social-distancing measures, and there are media reports that the government is covering up the extent of its outbreak. So far, only 25 cases and eight deaths have been reported in the country of roughly 6.5 million. The figure is likely a vast underestimate.
Even without accurate figures, the overall picture is not looking good. We are deeply concerned with how rapidly the pandemic is expanding, Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), said in a press statement May 12. She continued:
In South America, health systems in large urban centers like Lima and Rio de Janeiro are quickly becoming overwhelmed. We are also witnessing a similar impact of COVID-19 on big cities across the Amazon basin.
When transmission is high in areas that function as regional hubs, neighboring areas are then quickly affectedas people move through roads and riversimpacting smaller towns and remote communities, including indigenous areas, where access to health care is challenging.
PAHO continues to coordinate the response across countries, but we call on national and local health authorities to work even more closely together to contain the spread of the virus and support health systems capacity."

New Zealand has officially beaten COVID-19.
The island country announced Monday, June 8, that its last remaining person with the infection had gone 48 hours without symptoms and is now considered recovered.
With no active cases, the government moved to alert level 1, the lowest of four alert levels that effectively lifts all remaining social-distancing measures. There are now no restrictions on movement, domestic travel, or gatherings. Fans of rugby and other sports are allowed to return, en masse, to stadiums. Schools, workplaces, restaurant, and shops are all open.
The only restrictions still in place are at the border. Entry to New Zealand is mostly being limited to citizens and residents. Those entering are required to complete a 14-day quarantine and be tested.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernwho has earned international praise for her handling of the pandemicwas thrilled by the news. In a press conference, she confessed that when she first heard it, she did a little dance in front of her daughter Neve, who is just shy of 2 years old. ""I showed Neve, she was caught a little by surprise but she joined in, having absolutely no idea why I was dancing around the lounge but enjoying it nonetheless,"" Ardern said.
The celebration comes just 101 days since New Zealand identified its first case, 75 days of being on any of the four COVID-19 alert levels, and 26 days of being at level 2.
Seventeen days have passed since any Kiwis have turned up positive for the infection, even though labs there have run more than 40,000 tests in that time frame. In the last week, labs reported running an average of 1,891 tests per day.
In all, the country of about 5 million has documented only 1,504 confirmed and probable cases, with 22 deathsall the deaths were in people who were aged 60 or above. The country has run a total of nearly 300,000 tests since testing began January 22. Officials confirmed the first case on February 28, in a person who had returned from Iran.
We went hard and early
New Zealands success is attributed to its relatively swift and aggressive efforts to ramp up testing and tracing, isolate cases, quarantine contacts, and institute lockdownsplus its geographical advantage of being an island nation has been helpful.
The government unveiled its four-level alert system in late March, which provided clear, countrywide measures to address each state of transmission. Level 4, the lockdown level, goes into effect when the disease is likely not contained and spreading through the community.
If the state of the outbreak improves such that theres still community transmission but clusters of infections can be managed by testing and contact tracing, the country moves to Level 3, the restrict level. At this point, some social-distancing measures can be lifted; schools can reopen and small gatherings of 10 or fewer are allowed, for instance.
When community transmission is contained but risk of it lingers, the country moves to level 2, the reduce level. Here, gatherings can be as large as 100, and businesses can resume some activities while still requiring people to keep physical distance from one another.
Last is level 1, the prepare level. Social-distancing measures and other restrictions are lifted, but testing and tracing capacity remain at the ready, sick people must stay at home, and everyone should continue to practice enhanced hygiene. Additionally, people are encouraged to log their whereabouts to aid any potential need to trace disease spread in the future. To help with this, businesses are encouraged to have QR codes at doorways so people can keep a digital diary of their whereabouts.
United
When the alert levels were released on March 21, the level was set to 2. There were just 56 confirmed and probable cases at the time. By March 25, the government moved to level 4. By then, labs had completed 13,382 tests, and officials had identified 205 confirmed and probable cases.
We have community transmission in New Zealand, confirmed in four cases and suspected in other cases we are investigating, a March 25 media release from the Ministry of Health read.
We move tonight to Alert level 4. We will see a rise in cases for the next 10 days, from people infected before today. The numbers will continue to increase before they turn around. That turnaround will happen if we all do what is asked of us. If we all play our part we will break the chain of community transmission.
In todays announcement on moving to level 1, Ardern noted that the country went hard and early and united in an unprecedented ways to crush the virus.
Our team of 5 million has both sacrificed and achieved a huge amount in just under 11 weeks.""
But, she noted that the elimination now doesnt mean New Zealand has forever rid itself of the new coronavirus, which is still raging in many places around the globe, including the United States.
We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now, but elimination is not a point in time, it is a sustained effort, she said at the news conference. We almost certainly will see cases here again, and I do want to say that again, we will almost certainly see cases here again, and that is not a sign that we have failed, it is a reality of this virus. But if and when that occurs we have to make sureand we arethat we are prepared."

The COVID-19 crisis is hitting almost every market sector hard, and now the dominos are starting to fall. As other small, medium, and large businesses pare back operations or shutter for good, the tech firms that rely on enterprise clients are themselves taking heavy losses and laying off personnel.
Both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and IBM this week announced significant cost-cutting measures, including pay cuts and significant job losses.
IBM announced its layoffs late Thursday. In a statement, the company said the ""highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly remix high-value skills,"" which in this case means deciding you no longer place a high value on the skills a significant number of employees bring to the socially distanced table.
IBM, like many firms now facing cuts and layoffs, was not in the best of financial situations before COVID-19 hit. The company's CEO, Arvind Krishna, has been with the company for decades but only stepped into the top seat in April, saying at the time he was focused on building up the parts of the company that support cloud computing and artificial intelligence and willing to move away from the rest.
IBM did not specify how many positions were being cut, but both The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News report thousands of employees were affected in five states: California, New York, North Carolina, Missouri, and Pennsylvania.
Employees, who spoke to Bloomberg on the condition of anonymity, reported entire teams are being cut and mentioned receiving severance packages. IBM said in a statement it would offer subsidized medical coverage to affected employees for the next 12 months.
HPE also announced its cost-cutting plans on Thursday as part of its more recent quarterly earnings report. The company will cut some salaries through at least October 31, with executives seeing pay cuts of 20 to 25 percent.

Although the company expects to conduct layoffs, company leadership did not specify in which divisions or how many jobs are at stake. For now, the company said it is ""working through the details in the next couple months"" to determine what makes sense for the business.

The clearest way out of the COVID-19 crisis is to develop a safe, effective vaccineand scientists have wasted no time in getting started.
They have at least 102 vaccine candidates in development worldwide. Eight of those have already entered early clinical trials in people. At least two have protected a small number of monkeys from infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19.
Some optimistic vaccine developers say that, if all goes perfectly, we could see large-scale production and limited deployment of vaccines as early as this fall. If true, it would be an extraordinary achievement. Less than four months ago, SARS-CoV-2 was an unnamed, never-before-seen virus that abruptly emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Researchers there quickly identified it and, by late January, had deciphered and shared its genetic code, allowing researchers around the world to get to work on defeating it. By late February, researchers on multiple continents were working up clinical trials for vaccine candidates. By mid-March, two of them began, and volunteers began receiving the first jabs of candidate vaccines against COVID-19.
Its a record-setting feat. But, its unclear if researchers will be able to maintain this break-neck pace.
Generally, vaccines must go through three progressively more stringent human trial phases before they are considered safe and effective. The phases assess the candidates safety profile, the strength of the immune responses they trigger, and how good they are at actually protecting people from infection and disease.
Most vaccine candidates dont make it. By some estimates, more than 90 percent fail. And, though a pandemic-propelled timeline could conceivably deliver a vaccine in as little as 18 months, most vaccines take yearsoften more than 10 years, in factto go from preclinical vetting to a syringe in a doctors office.
Abridging that timeline can up the risk of failure. For instance, vaccine candidates usually enter the three phases of clinical trials only after being well tested in lab animals that can model the human disease. But, with such a new virus, there is no established animal model for COVID-19. And amid a devastating pandemic, theres not enough time to thoroughly develop one. Some researchers are now doing that ground-level animal work in parallel with human trialssuch as the small monkey trials mentioned above.
Researchers already have reason to be a little anxious about the safety of any COVID-19 vaccine. When they tried in the past to make vaccines against some of SARS-CoV-2s coronavirus relatives, they found a small number of instances when candidate vaccines seemed to make infections worse. That is, these candidate vaccines seemed to prompt berserk immune responses that caused lung damage in monkeys and liver damage in ferrets. Researchers still dont fully understand the problem and dont know if it could happen in humans, let alone if it will show up with the new candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
But we may soon know the answers. As the pandemic tops the grim milestone of three million cases worldwide and well over 200,000 deaths, researchers are relentlessly moving forward with vaccine development. Here's where the scientific community currently stands in its frenetic effort.
First, the basics
Researchers are using a wide variety of tools and techniques to develop a vaccinesome are tried and tested, others are fresh and unproven. Regardless of the strategy, they all aim to do the same thing: train the immune system to identify SARS-CoV-2 (or some element of it) and destroy it before it establishes an infection and causes COVID-19.
The way a vaccine can pull this off, typically, is by feeding immune cells a signature element of a disease-causing germ, such as a unique protein that coats the outside of a dangerous virus. From there, a type of white blood cell called B cells can generate antibodies that specifically recognize and glom onto those signature germ elements. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins, which have their germ-specific detecting regions on their outstretched arms. The base of their Y shape is a generic region that can signal certain immune responses if they detect an invading germ.
A strong, effective vaccine can generate so-called neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies circulate in the blood, surveilling the whole body after a vaccine is given. If the germ theyre trained to detect actually shows up, the antibodies can swarm and paralyze it. The base of the antibodiesnow dangling off their smothered target germcan then signal immune cells to help finish the job.
In the case of COVID-19, the goal of candidate vaccines is to train our immune systems to make antibodies that specifically detect and destroy SARS-CoV-2 (which is, again, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Though theres a lot we dont know about SARS-CoV-2, we know enough of the basics to direct early vaccine development.
We know that SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus related to two other notorious betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes MERS.
Coronaviruses, generally, keep their genetic blueprints in the form of a large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is bundled into a round viral particle. That genetic code provides the molecular instructions to make all of the components of the virus, including enzymes required to make copies of the viruss genome, and the viruss famous spike protein.
The spike protein is what the coronaviruses use to grab ahold of host cellsthat is, human cells they infect or the cells of any other animal victim. Once the virus latches on with its spike protein, it gets into the cell and hijacks the cell's activities, forcing it to help manufacture viral clones, which then burst forth to infect more cells.
There are many copies of the spike protein on the outer surface of coronaviruses, creating a spikey exteriorthink a cartoon sea mine. The pointy adornments are actually what give coronaviruses their name. Under an electron microscope, the spikes give the viral particle a crown-like appearance, hence corona viruses. But more importantly, the spike proteins are a prime target for antibodies. And, because we have the whole genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2, researchers have a good start at figuring out effective ways to engineer vaccines to attack the spike proteins and other critical components of the virus.
Vaccine platforms
There are many ways to try to train the immune system to fight off a specific germ or specific elements of germs, such as SARS-CoV-2 or the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Here are the general categories currently in play:
Live-attenuated vaccine: These vaccines use whole viruses that are weakened so they can no longer cause disease. This is a well-established method for creating vaccines. In the past, researchers weakened viruses by growing them in lab conditions for long periods of timewhich is a bit like domesticating germs. The cushy, all-inclusive petri-dish lifestyle can essentially allow viruses and bacteria to adapt to their tranquil surroundings and lose virulence over time. But, it can take a while. Scientists grew the measles virus in lab conditions for nearly 10 years before using it for a live-attenuated vaccine in the early 1960s.
Nowadays, there are faster, more controlled approaches to engineer weakened viruses, such as targeted mutations and other manipulations of a viruss genetic code.
Live-attenuated virus vaccines have the advantage of generating the same variety of protective antibodies as a real infectionwithout causing a pesky, life-threatening disease, for the most part. But there are risks. Because the virus can still replicate, certain people (particularly those with immunodeficiencies) may have severe reactions. Though the newer strategies for weakening viruses may reduce these risks, they still require extensive safety testing before reaching the market.
That said, this is a vaccine platform that has already proven successful. Several vaccines in use are live-attenuated vaccines, including vaccines for chickenpox and typhoid. If such a vaccine proved effective at preventing COVID-19, we already have the know-how and infrastructure to quickly scale up production to make these vaccines.
Inactivated vaccine: This is another straightforward, old-school method that uses whole viruses. In this case, the viruses are effectively dead, though, usually inactivated by heat or chemicals. These corpse viruses can still prime the immune system to make neutralizing antibodies; they just do it less efficiently.
The advantage of this strategy is that it is relatively simple to make these types of vaccines and, because the viruses dont replicate, there is no risk of infection and less risk of severe reactions. Disadvantages include that inactivated, non-replicating viruses dont illicit as strong of an immune response as a disease-causing or weakened virus. Inactivated vaccines always require multiple doses and may need periodic booster shots as well.
Like weakened virus vaccines, using a whole viral particle gives the immune system many potential viral targets for antibodies. Some may be good targets to neutralize a real infection, and some may not. But, using an inactivated virus is a proven method. For instance, some existing vaccines against polio, hepatitis A, and rabies use this method.
Viral vector-based vaccine: For these vaccines, researchers take a weakened or harmless virus and engineer it to contain an element of a dangerous virus they want to protect against.
In the context of COVID-19, this might mean engineering a harmless virus to produce, say, the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. This way you get the immune response to a live but benign virus, coupled with the likelihood of having antibodies that target a specific critical protein from the dangerous SARS-CoV-2.
This, too, is a proven strategy for effective vaccines. The newly approved Ebola vaccine, for instance, uses this method.
Subunit vaccines: These are bare-bones vaccines that include only a component of a dangerous virus to elicit immune responses. For COVID-19 vaccines, the spike protein isno surprisea popular candidate.
Subunits can be delivered in formulations with adjuvantsaccessory ingredients that can enhance immune responses. One common adjuvant is alum, an aluminum salt, long known to be useful for vaccines. Some newer subunit vaccines come in snappier packages, however. These include artificial virus-like particles (VLPs) and nanoparticles.
Subunit vaccines are already an established vaccine platform. The HPV vaccine in use involves a VLP that feeds the immune system proteins from the HPVs outer shellwhich can then be targeted by antibodies.
RNA and DNA vaccines: These are among the newest types of vaccinesand among the shakiest. There are currently no licensed vaccines that use this method. But researchers are optimistic about their potential.
The basic idea is to deliver genetic material of a viruseither in the form of DNA or RNAdirectly to human cells, which are then somehow compelled to translate that genetic code into viral proteins and then able to make antibodies against those.
Some of the details of how these candidate vaccines work are proprietary and unproven, so its difficult to assess how likely they are to succeed or how easy it will be to scale up vaccine production if they are successful."

Despite disruptions to both supply and demand caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Apple posted $58.3 billion in revenue in its second quarter, eking out 1 percent growth over last year's second quarter.
This beat some recent expectations by investors, but it falls well behind the $63-67 billion guidance for the quarter the company initial gave before the coronavirus' effects were fully felt. Apple's retail stores have been closed around much of the world, and for a period of time earlier this year, its ability to assemble iPhones and other products was hampered as the virus first spread in China.
CEO Tim Cook spoke optimistically about the company's long-term prospects on a call with investors today, but in a break with common practice, Apple did not provide guidance for the next quarter, citing the inability to predict the pandemic's future impact. ""We have great confidence in the long-term of our business,"" Cook said. ""In the short-term, it's hard to see out the windshield to know what the next 60 days look like, and so we're not giving guidance because of that lack of visibility and uncertainty.""The tentpole achievement of this quarter was $13.3 billion in services revenue, up $2.2 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago. Services includes things like Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News. Along with wearables, services have been the company's primary focus in a strategy to make up for slowing iPhone revenue growth.
iPhone revenue was $28.96 billion, wearables pulled in $10.01 billion, Mac $5.35 billion, and iPad $4.36 billion. Apple executives noted that a significant portion of Mac buyers were new to the platform, and that the company's overall global install base has reached a new high.
Speaking of the company's financials amidst the pandemic, Cook said, ""There was a significant, very steep fall-off in February. That began to recover some in March, and we've seen further recovery in April. So, it leaves us room for optimism.""It felt as if he spent at least as much time on the call talking about efforts by the company to combat the pandemic directly as he did discussing the business. That included the design and mass-production of face shields, the sourcing of protective masks, 2:1 donation matching for employees, and other initiatives. He spoke briefly about Apple's commitment to contribute $350 billion to developing the US economy. Also, Apple is proceeding with plans to buy back more of its stock from investors with its considerable cash reserves.
It was an unusual earnings call for an unusual time. Cook seemed to think so, too. ""It was a very unique quarter,"" he said. ""I've never had anything quite like this. I hope to never have it again, but I'm incredibly proud of the company and what was achieved during that period of time.""
Apple's stock was down several points in after-hours trading following the call."

It may sound unsettling or even downright creepy for the device thats generally with you 24/7 to make it possible for authorities to trace your exposure to a potentially fatal illness thats currently consuming the world. Thats why Apple and Google have been bending over backward to provide privacy assurances about the platform-compatible programming interfaces theyre putting into iOS and Android. On Monday, they offered new details, as well as images of the push notifications users might receive should they have come into contact with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19.
Among the assurances provided is that apps that use the application programming interfaces can only be developed by or for public health authorities and that the limited amount of information they can collect may be used solely for tracing COVID-19 infections. Apps will be barred from seeking location permissions and must collect the least amount of data possible to trace the physical contacts of other opt-in app users who later find out theyre infected. None of the data collected may be used for any commercial purposes.
Besides the assurances, the companies gave a sneak peak of the permissions users must provide and the look of push exposure notifications to be delivered to a users phone. Here are the images:

Effective but risky (and costly)
Health experts have said that contact tracingor the process of tracing all the people an infected person has come into physical contact with over the previous 14 daysis one of the most effective ways to contain exposure to the novel coronavirus. Once identified, people exposed can be monitored or go into quarantine for the next two weeks.
To date, US and worldwide infections have reached 1.2 million and 3.6 million, respectively, with 68,000 and 1.2 million deaths. The Trump administration recently projected deaths in this country would range from 100,000 to 200,000.
While contact tracing is one of the best hopes for keeping the numbers as low as possible, its extremely time and work intensive, since it traditionally requires large numbers of health workers to perform interviews. The practice is also prone to error and uncertainty because the people being interviewed have faulty memories and can only report contacts with others who are known to the infected person.
Phone apps could provide a much more efficient and accurate means of tracing that was never available during previous pandemics. But it comes with potentially dystopian side effects unless developersof apps and in particular of the interfaces that the apps callarent designed with care. Apple and Google intend the details provided on Monday to ensure developers with both companies are carefully using those considerations to fully inform the platform theyre building.
In all, the details provided during a conference call with reporters on Monday included the following, although some of them repeated assurances offered last month, when the APIs were first announced.<ul><li>Apps must be created by or for a government public health authority and can only be used for COVID-19 response efforts.</li><li>Apps must require full user consent before they can use the exposure notification API.</li><li>Apps must require users to consent before sharing a positive test result, and the Diagnosis Keys associated with their devices, with the public health authority.</li><li>Apps should collect only the minimum amount of data necessary and can only use that data for COVID-19 response efforts. All other uses of user data, including targeting advertising, is not permitted.</li><li>Apps are prohibited from seeking permission to access Location Services.</li><li>Use of the API will be restricted to one app per country to promote high user adoption and avoid fragmentation. If a country has opted for a regional or state approach, the companies are prepared to support those authorities.</li></ul>Caution and criticism
Privacy advocates have received the initiative with mixed results, with some experts saying they are cautiously optimistic and others saying the project is doomed to exposing sensitive infections, locations, contacts, and other sensitive information, possibly at an unprecedented scale. The companies have already built the interfaces into beta versions of their mobile operating systems and plan to make them available in general releases later this month.
The newly provided images suggest that the push messages will reveal the date or dates the contact took place. They also illustrate the permissions users must provide to opt in to the system. Its still too early to determine if the health benefits of contact-tracing apps in always-on, always-have devices will outweigh the privacy risks. Apple and Google say they wont and are trying to provide evidence for that claim."

Evidence is stacking up to support a link between COVID-19 and a rare, mysterious inflammatory disease in children, which can be life-threatening.
Though reports of the new disease have trickled in from several countries, many of them have been anecdotal to this point. Now, doctors in an area of Italy hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic have published detailed data on a cluster of 10 children who experienced an unusual inflammatory disease amid the outbreak, lending solid support for the link. Their report appeared Wednesday in The Lancet.
The doctors describe the condition they saw as Kawasaki-like, referring to a rare disease in children that causes inflammation of blood vessels. Kawasaki diseaseidentified in Japan in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasakiis typically marked by sustained fever, rash, swelling of hands and feet, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. In the worst cases, it can lead to heart problems and aneurisms.
Despite being identified decades ago, Kawaskis cause still remains unclear. Researchers have widely hypothesized that infectious agentslike virusestrigger berserk immune responses in certain children with genetic predispositions. But no single germy culprit or genetic factors have been firmly nailed down. As such, its still unclear who will end up afflicted by the condition. Researchers have only determined that Kawaski primarily strikes children younger than five, often boys, and often people of Asian and Pacific Island descent.
Since the pandemic began, there have been scattered reports of an uptick in cases with a disease similar to Kawasaki in children. The cases seem linked to outbreaks of COVID-19. However, they dont always fit the classic definitions of Kawasaki.
In the new Lancet study, the Italian doctors offer a clear connection between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the Kawasaki-like disease. They also lay out in detail how the cases they saw differ from the classic forms of the disease, laying the groundwork for a COVID-19-specific form of the disease.
Surprising spike
To do that, the doctors reviewed medical records of children who were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease between January 1, 2015, and April 20, 2020, at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy. At the time of the study, the city of Bergamo had the highest rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Italy, which was ravaged by the pandemic.
The doctors identified only 29 cases in that time frame, 19 of which were diagnosed between January 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. The other 10 were identified between February 18 and April 20, 2020, as the COVID-19 outbreak raged. The spike during the outbreak represents a thirtyfold increase in incidence of the inflammatory condition.
The doctors suspected that all 10 of the Kawasaki cases during the outbreak had been infected with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. But only eight of the children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which are Y-shaped proteins made by the immune system to fight off the virus. The presence of the antibodies means that the children had been infected. The doctors suspect that the other two children were false negatives. One, for instance, had received a treatment of immunoglobulin, which may have interfered with the antibody test.
They also noted that previous studies done in 2005 and 2014 had also linked coronavirusesin these cases, ones that cause seasonal coldsto Kawasaki disease. Though other studies failed to find such a link, the authors argued that, together, this suggests that the coronavirus family might represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 being a particularly virulent strain able to elicit a powerful immune response in the host.
The presence of the virus in nearly all of the cases during the outbreak and the fact that the spike in inflammatory cases has a clear starting point after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in our area, convinced the doctors.
All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients, they concluded.
Mounting mysteries
But the doctors noted that the inflammatory disease was slightly different than the cases seen in the past. The children afflicted during the outbreak tended to be older, with an average age of 7.5, compared with the 19 pre-COVID cases, which had an average age of 3.
The outbreak cases also had more severe diseases. Six of the 10 had heart complications, compared with just two of the 19 cases from the pre-COVID era. Two outbreak cases had signs of toxic shock, which was not seen in any of the earlier cases. Finally, eight of the outbreak cases needed additional steroid treatments to recover, which was only needed in three of the pre-COVID cases.
Ultimately, the doctors were careful to call the cases seen during the outbreak a Kawaski-like disease.
In an accompanying editorial, Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics, and Elizabeth Whittaker, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Imperial College London, tried to tease this apart. They write: These differences raise the question as to whether this cluster is Kawasaki disease with SARS-CoV-2 as the triggering agent, or represents an emerging Kawasaki-like disease characterised by multisystem inflammation.
Like the Italian doctors, they highlight thathowever frighteningthis inflammatory disease is still rare, likely affecting no more than one in 1,000 children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Parents and doctors should be aware of it but also keep in mind that children are minimally affected by COVID-19 overall.
But, Viner and Whittaker note, that insight into whats going on with immune responses in this rare condition could help explain other mysteries of the illness.
Understanding this inflammatory phenomenon in children might provide vital information about immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and possible correlates of immune protection that might have relevance both for adults and children. In particular, if this is an antibody-mediated phenomenon, there might be implications for vaccine studies, and this might also explain why some children become very ill with COVID-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic."

Look, we're admittedly biased around the Ars Orbital HQ. Whether the best of times or worst of times, we routinely find comfort in a good book. COVID-19 has changed so much about our day-to-day lives, including some of our entertainment habits around things like gaming or streaming TV and film. But when it comes to precious reading time in between work and busy personal lives, we're continually drawn to the stories that grip usas grim as some of those may be.
This year's staff summer recommendation/To Be Read list has a few newer releases, plenty of old classics, and a lot of alternate reality/sci-fi. Ars' book tastes remain nothing if not on-brand, meaning we may never get through one of these without Douglas Adams being mentioned. Here's everything, Hitchhiker's Guides and others, we've been escaping to.
Enlarge/The Collapsing Empire, by John Scalzi
Series starters
Sci-fi fans who enjoy engaging characters and story driven more by human interaction than technical wharrgarbl will enjoy John Scalzi's latest trilogy, The Interdependency. The third book just released last week, and it ties things up neatlya first, for Scalzi. The Interdependency is an old-school galaxy-spanning empire, with a twisthabitable planets are almost impossibly difficult to find, and in an effort to curtail war, the Interdependency was designed so that no system can survive without trade with the others.
This arrangement is fine, until systems begin being inexorablyand permanentlycutting off from access to one another, heralding a collapse of civilization itself. Scalzi lightly channels the kind of wry humor the late, great Douglas Adams was best known for, though never going over-the-top into outright comedy.
If you're looking for something a little further off the beaten path, I've also been enjoying a series called The Murderbot Diaries, by Martha Wells. I'm only a couple of books into the five-book series, but Wells' description of a confused rogue AI in a cyborg body, with absolutely everything designed, maintained, and forcibly supplied by the lowest bidder, is both charming and engaging. The Murderbot has its own desires, needs, and goalsit's just not too clear what those are, beyond doing as half-assed a job as possible in order to leave more time for trashy soap-opera consumption.Jim Salter, Technology Reporter
Sci-fi, lots of sci-fi
I read, um, kind of a lotbetween 50 and 100 novels a year, most yearsand I'm always happy to talk books. In these quarantimes, leaning in and running away seem to be the two big categories in my reading. Sticking to books that were published in the last decade (so leaving out annual comfort re-reads of Lloyd Alexander and Terry Pratchett), I have some thoughts.
If you like motley crews in space: Becky Chambers's Wayfarer series, starting with The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. Chambers's books are optimistic, character-driven science fiction; stories about people and how they feel in a strange and exciting future. Soft and cozy reading.
Just this week I also finished the two books to date in Alex White's Salvagers series, starting with A Big Ship at the Edge of the Universe. Motley crew of talented space pirates, but also with magic and a set of moral codes. Zippy reading, genuine fun.
If you like cities: I cannot recommend N.K. Jemisin's latest, The City We Became, highly enough, especially if you love cities and double especially if you've spent any time in New York. I haven't lived in New York City since 2008, and I still could smell and feel and hear every single page. Cities have souls, and this is their story.
If you liked Hidden Figures: Mary Robinette Kowal's Lady Astronaut books, The Calculating Stars and The Fated Sky. As a Washington, DC, resident, I didn't love my home being wiped off the map at the start of the apocalypse, but for all that a story of doom kicks off the tale, it is optimistic, Right Stuff spacefaring fiction at its finest.
And if you really want to lean into the apocalypse: Chuck Wendig's Wanderers poses a pandemic from an animal-borne virus striking humanity right against the landscape of a US presidential election year. It's the wrong book to read in our actual 2020 if you're prone to giving yourself nightmares, but it's still a very good book.Kate Cox, Tech Policy Reporter
Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams are among the executive producers of HBO's Lovecraft Country.
Two greats set in the past
Now is the perfect time to read Lovecraft Country, the 2016 dark fantasy/horror novel by Matt Ruff, since HBO's adapted series will debut in August. Set in the Jim Crow era of the 1950s, it's structured almost as a series of short stories, although everything is inter-related and hangs together beautifully as a whole. The first quarter focuses on Atticus, a black Korean war veteran and big H.P. Lovecraft fan, despite the author's notorious racism. When his estranged father disappears, leaving a cryptic message, Atticus sets out on a road trip from Chicago's South Side to rural Massachusetts. He's accompanied by his Uncle Georgepublisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guideand his childhood friend Letitia.
There are plenty of sly references to the works of Lovecraft for the astute reader, as we encounter a secret cabal called the Order of the Ancient Dawn, a haunted house, a strange pocket universe, time shifting, shape-shifters, an evil mannequin, and a cursed book. What makes the book so ingeniously subversive, however, is that the worst monsters are not eldritch terrors or a Shoggoth in the woods; it's the stark racism and bigotry our protagonists encounter along the way.
Beyond that, I've got one other recommendation: Iain Pears' sprawling 1997 novel, An Instance of the Fingerpost. Part historical murder mystery, part philosophical rumination on the unreliability of human memory and personal narrativesaka the ""Rashomon effect"" after Akira Kurosawa's classic 1950 film the novel remains one of my all-time favorite reads that I return to every few years. The title refers to a quote from Francis Bacon, who held that all evidence is fallible, and yet there can be ""one instance of a fingerpost that points in one direction only, and allows of no other possibility.""
Pears is a former BBC reporter who garnered early success with his art-history mysteries featuring fictional detective/art historian Jonathan Argyll. Those novels are light and quite fun, but with Fingerpost, Pears attains a whole new level of thematic complexity. It's almost as if he started out writing a simple tale of a 17th-century Oxford murder, only to be carried away as that world and its denizens came alive for him. It's been justly compared to Umberto Eco's 1980 bestselling novel The Name of the Rose, although I prefer Fingerpost.
This was a tumultuous period of enlightenment, when new scientific ideas were flourishing and conflicting with religious institutions, and political intrigue was everywhere. There are four sections, each narrated by a different character, each remembering their version of the 1663 arsenic poisoning of a man named Robert Grove many years later. A servant girl confessed, but the four witnessesan Italian physician, the son of an alleged Royalist traitor, a cryptographer, and an Oxford archivisteach identified a different culprit, and only one will ultimately reveal the truth about what really happened. Pears masterfully evokes Restoration England, as Charles II regained the throne after Oliver Cromwell's short-lived attempt at a republic, and his characters (historical figures and fictional ones) are richly detailed. It's a long book but so riveting that you'll be tempted to devour it as fast as possible, and you'll be pondering the nature of truth entirely by the end.Jennifer Ouellette, Senior Writer"

Every week now seems to bring news of another Hollywood project being delayed. Sometimes this is because you can't make money in an empty theater, but it's just as often due to production halts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of that industry hits pause for now, one crucial segment has notthe writers. Like many of us, they've instead become intimately familiar with the inner workings of on-the-job Zoom calls. 
""I kind of feel for every aspiring TV writer at home right now due to the pandemic,"" said Sera Gamble, showrunner of Netflix's You (formerly of Supernatural and The Magicians), during this year's online-only edition of the ATX TV Festival. ""They're trying to write while doing a bunch of other stuff; well, congrats, you're now in showrunner training. I've frequently had to sit down in the past and rewrite a script in a moment that felt like a severe crisis, and sometimes it was a severe crisis. But it feels like that times 10. I have to reset expectations every morning: I wake up, wait a minute before checking my phone, check in with loved ones, and then take the problems of the day as they come... [I tell my writers] 'You can't solve what you can't solve, so what can we get done in the next hour?'""
For this late-addition panel to this year's ATX TV Festival, Gamble (virtually) joined Dan Goor(Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Parks and Rec),Melinda Hsu Taylor(Nancy Drew, Lost), and Beth Schwartz (Sweet Tooth, Arrow) to take streamers ""Inside the Writers (Zoom) Room."" For some, the change came abruptly. Hsu Taylor and her staff had nearly completed both writing and production on the latest season of Nancy Drew when suddenly they had to convert everything to be remote-friendly (she credits doing a Zoom birthday for her son around that time for helping her grasp the basic logistics and experience). Other writers started wholesale in a digital world, like the staff of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. They were five weeks into story-breaking at the time of this panel and hadn't been together in-person at all while working on the upcoming season eight.
No one had a choice, of course. As COVID-19 continues to surge in the United Statesthe country passed the 2-million-case mark within the last two weeksall walks of life must adjust. And when any in-person interactions come with potentially life-threatening risk for the foreseeable future, suddenly Zoom calls sound downright preferable.
""Right when we went home, there was a little bit of a relief,"" Gamble said. ""We were social distancing in two separate rooms for weeks before we went home just so people could have six to 10 feet between them. At one point, I asked a writer's assistant to track how often 'coronavirus' was saidit was every two minutes. So at least if we went home, we'd be able to work.""
The work
Logistically, certain things have been trickier for TV writers in this shared Zoom existence. Larger writers' rooms pushing 10 people or more may have difficulty translating into a single Zoom chat, where not talking over each other and reading the room become harder. So, You and Brooklyn Nine-Nine now opt to have multiple, smaller Zoom calls focused on more narrowly defined tasks, and only the showrunner will hop between conversations. That magic writers often like to refer tothe creative spark, the inner-staff interactions where a lunch convo might solve a plot problem later that afternoonhas also proven harder to recreate in these digital work spaces.View more stories
""It's more efficient, but it is weird and less fun,"" Goor said. ""There's less joking around. We did every possible Zoom joke we could do that first weekchanged all the backgrounds, mine was my mom's water colors. We did background videos of each other... so I guess we found new ways to waste time, now that I think about... But it's nice to feel a reaction to a pitch, and it's much harder to do that over Zoom. I find myself talking myself out of story ideas.""
Early on at least, Zoom has also surprised writers with a few positive benefits. In writers' rooms where some staffers have been with a show much longer than others, Zoom may take away some unspoken hierarchical barriers and put everyone on equal footing. ""There's something democratizing about these squares that are always present and equally sized,"" Goor said. ""For new people, it might be easier to speak up now. 'Oh, and April, what do you have to say about this?'"" Zoom also inherently leads to less workday interruption: fewer bathroom breaks, less losing the room to endless joke-offs, and skipping longer lunch routines like the Brooklyn Nine-Nine staff's elaborate Wheel of Fortune-style approach to selecting takeout.
But perhaps the biggest change? The pandemic has given everyone in the writers' room a more holistic perspective on lifeepisode four of season whatever no longer gets to be anyone's most important thing. Add it all up, and many writers now have a much more traditional work day.
""Comedy hours are usually bad, and they've become so much better,"" Goor said, noting how he now typically works 10am to 12:30pm, takes lunch, and resumes from 1:30p to 5:30p. ""Routinely for the first few seasons, we'd eat dinner [in the writers' room] and be there till 8pm or 10pm or 11pm for a table read. We've adjusted. It's partly because it's impossible to look at Zoom for that long, but it's partly so people can be with their families, be healthy, and experience life.""
Focusing at home versus when you're physically in a space for a specific task can be a new challenge, but these TV writers continue to find approaches that work for individual groups. Hsu Taylor and the Nancy Drew staff start each session with a three-minute meditation to intentionally tell their minds that work time has begun. ""I know some people are checking their email because I hear clicking,"" she said. ""But I think most like this. 'OK, I'm doing this now.' I'm telling my mind and body to be here for the next few hours."" And some former tasks that would force writers to split their attention now don't exist, like having to be on set for script tweaks during an episode you may have written.
""With production being down,"" Schwartz said, ""you can really focus on the scripts instead of being all over the place.""

The end product
Whether good or bad, our new reality has absolutely already impacted what we'll eventually see on screen. You, for instance, centers on a bookstore manager creepily obsessed with an aspiring young writer. To put it succinctly, the show frequently has characters at least kissing. But for the upcoming season three, that may be one aspect needing to change, no questions asked.
""We can't put people in dangerTV shows aren't worth that,"" said Gamble. ""So we'll change what we can and keep an eye on the lines we don't want to cross. We won't do the show and have it be shitty because there was a pandemic. We'll be measured and try to maintain the spirits of the show. But it's a conversation, scene by scene by scene.""
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates shifts in logistics, too. Where you can film and who can you film obviously feeds into what scenes a writing staff can write. The writers noted productions in Canada and New Zealand, like Nancy Drew and Sweet Tooth, will happen first since those countries have navigated COVID-19 better than the US. And with mandated quarantine for travelers to those places, local actors could have a leg up for roles, too.
For Goor and the Brooklyn Nine-Nine team, new logistical concerns start with babies. No explicit spoilers, but two characters had one last season, and the team suddenly has to look at animatronics and maybe less overall on-screen infant time (""There's going to be a run on those bespoke fake babies,"" Gamble joked).
""It's hard, because we're doing stories on the work-life balance for these people. This goes in so many different directions and we still don't know where [the pandemic] is going, so it's hard to write for it,"" Goor said. ""Is it safe to shoot outside? Originally, we wanted everything to be a bottle episode, so we can shoot on the stages, [and] it'll be controlled. But now, is it better to do all exteriors? Because it seems like it's healthier and safer for people. How many extras can you have? Can you use kids? And since there will be waves of productions, with movies and pilots starting, too, availability for guest cast will be a lot harder. Five-episode guest-star arcs are now harder.""
All these decisions ultimately bleed into the business of TV, too. For writers, maybe the option of participating in a writer's room remotely suddenly becomes more commonplace, democratizing the career for people outside of NYC and LA (and those cities' sky-high rents). And not having to commute regularly or be in one physical space would mean writers' rooms could welcome writers with physical disabilities more easily, thus bringing wider perspectives to a host of shows.
""I think there's a reason we do [in-person writers' rooms], and it's not just to spend studio money on all that rentit's good for creativity and production,"" says Gamble. ""But it will be easier to say, 'We should just meet on Zoom on some days.' And for the disabled community, if an agent were to call and pitch me somebody and explain why someone could rarely or never be on set, well, I know that works now. If this all leads to a crop of great writers breaking into the business, that excites me.""

As the entire world continues to grapple with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, it's only natural to have a ton of questions. Ars has done its best to keep readers on top of the most important news while also providing key perspective on those big-picture questions. Where does the spread stand this week? I should be wearing a mask, right? How does science get a vaccine together (and are researchers close)?
So far, however, we haven't totally attempted to grapple with one of the pandemic's biggest outstanding and timely inquiries: what should reopening look like? Beyond essential businesses and healthcare facilities, this month we've slowly started witnessing things like drive-ins returning or racing leagues announce restarts. With entire states from Texas to Florida recently easing various guidelines and restrictions on businesses and public movement, thinking about reopening (whether now is the right time, the kind of safety mechanisms necessary, etc.) feels more pertinent than ever.
This Thursday at 1:30pm ET (10:30am PT), we'll be pondering precisely that when talking to an expert on the subject: Harvard Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science Dr. Joseph Allen. This spring, Dr. Allen has been sought out by everyone from The New York Times to ESPN for his particular expertise in building science, or how indoor build environments from homes and schools to labs and stadiums impact our overall health. (The extreme TL;DR for these times: proper ventilation, filtration, and humidity can help reduce the spread of pathogens.) Dr. Allen has an upcoming book on the subject, Healthy Buildings available on April 21, and obviously COVID-19 has made his focus on the intersection of building science and health science all the more vital.
In (a socially distant, video-chatted) conversation with Ars' intrepid health reporter Dr. Beth Mole, Dr. Allen will field questions from Ars and readers to help us understand and imagine what reopening might (and should) look like for communities and workplaces. The discussion will happen through the livestreaming app Periscope and will be hosted on the Ars Technica Twitter account (@arstechnicayou can certainly @ us with questions), but we'll also embed the video below once things get underway for those who prefer to sit tight onsite. In the meantime, check out some of Dr. Allen's insights linked above and start sharing the most urgent questions on your mind below."

In mid-March, just before President Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency, Stanford psychology professor Robb Willer posted a call to arms on Twitter, asking for suggestions on how the social and behavioral sciences could help to address the pandemic. What ideas might we have to recommend? What research could we do? he asked. All ideas, half-baked or otherwise, are welcome!
Given the importance of our social interactions to the spread of the pandemic, behavioral sciences should have a lot to tell us. So Willer got a large response, and the result was a huge team effort coordinated by Willer and New York University social psychology professor Jay van Bavel. The goal: to sum up all the best and most relevant research from psychology, sociology, public health, and other social sciences. Published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour last weeka lightning-fast turnaround for academiathe resulting paper highlights research that addresses behavioral questions that have come up in the pandemic, from understanding cultural differences to minimizing scientific misinformation.
Different sections, each written by researchers with expertise in that particular field, summarize research on topics from social inequality to science communication and fake news. Responding to the crisis requires people to change their behavior, the papers authors argue, so we need to draw on behavioral research to help align human behavior with the recommendations of epidemiologists and public health experts.
But while Willer, van Bavel, and their colleagues were putting together their paper, another team of researchers put together their own, entirely opposite, call to arms: a plea, in the face of an avalanche of behavioral science research on COVID-19, for psychology researchers to have some humility. This papercurrently published online in draft format and seedingaviddebateson social mediaargues that much of psychological research is nowhere near the point of being ready to help in a crisis. Instead, it sketches out an evidence readiness framework to help people determine when the field will be.
So are the social sciences ready to help us navigate the pandemic? Evidently, experts disagree, and their scuffle is part of a broader debate about how much evidence we need before we act. The coronavirus crisis forces a tough, society-wide lesson on scientific uncertainty. And with such escalated stakes, how do we balance the potential harm of acting prematurely with the harm of not acting at all?
Enlarge/ Humanity, being all complicated again at the Pennsylvania capital.
If humans didnt insist on being quite so messily human, pandemic response would be much simpler. People would stay physically separated whenever possible; leaders would be proactive and responsive to evidence; our fight could be concentrated on the biomedical tools we so urgently need. The problem is that our maddening, imperfect humanity gets in the way at every turn, and getting around those imperfections demands that we understand the human behavior underlying them.
It's also clear that we need to understand the differences between groups of people to get a handle on the pandemic. Speculation has been rampant about how cultural differences might influence what sort of responses are palatable. And some groups are suffering disproportionately: death rates are higher among African-American and Latinx communities in the US, while a large analysis from the UK found that black, minority ethnic, and poorer people are at higher risk of deathour social inequalities, housing, transport, and food systems all play a role in shaping the crisis. We cant extricate people and our complicated human behavior and society from the pandemic: they are one and the same.
In their paper, Van Bavel, Willer and their group of behavioral research proponents point to studies from fields like public health, sociology and psychology. They cover work on cultural differences, social inequality, mental health, and more, pulling out suggestions for how the research could be useful for policymakers and community leaders.
Those recommendations are pretty intuitive. For effective communications, it could be helpful to lean on sources that carry weight in different communities, like religious leaders, they suggest. And public health messaging that emphasizes protecting othersrather than fixating on just protecting oneselftends to be persuasive, the proponents argue.
But not everyone is convinced that it would necessarily be a good idea to act on the recommendations. Many of the topics surveyed are relevant, write psychologist Hans IJzerman and a team of critics in their draft. The team's concern isnt the relevance of the research; its how robust that research is. If there are critical flaws in the supporting data, then applying these lessons on a broad scale could be worse than uselessit could be actively harmful.
I was pretty disappointed, says Simine Vazire, a UC Davis psychology professor and one of the team of critics. In the introduction to their paper, van Bavel and the other proponents write that each section describes the quality of the evidence that it rests on. But there was nowhere near the level of evidence evaluation Vazire expected, she says. She points to a section on healthy mindsets, which suggests that with the right mindset, difficult experiences can lead to stress-related growthand that mindsets can be changed with just short interventions.
That literature is really flawed, she says. There are probably individuals who grow from stress, but its not the norm. Its an irresponsible thing to claim, she argues: It could make people feel bad if they think most people grow from trauma and stress, and if they dontwhich is much, much more typicalthat could add to their depression and anxiety.
Sander van der Linden, a psychologist at Cambridge University and one of van Bavels co-authors, argues that the paper was cautious in its claims, taking care to phrase things using words that convey uncertainty, avoid direct prescriptions for policy, and point out where more research is needed. The paper is intended to function more as an opinion piece, he says, and less as a claim of whats true and whats false."

Whistleblower Rick Bright plans to tell Congress that ""2020 will be the darkest winter in modern history"" if the United States ignores warnings from scientists that it's too early to fully reopen the economy.
Bright, who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) until he says Trump administration officials forced him out of his position, is scheduled to testify tomorrow at a House hearing on the topic of ""protecting scientific integrity in the COVID-19 response."" Bright's written testimony was posted online today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health, which is holding the hearing.
Bright wrote:
While I am unfortunately no longer leading BARDA, I am an expert in these areas and fully understand the grave risks we are facing. I continue to believe that we must act urgently to effectively combat this deadly disease. Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities. While it is terrifying to acknowledge the extent of the challenge that we currently confront, the undeniable fact is there will be a resurgence of the COVID-19 this fall, greatly compounding the challenges of seasonal influenza and putting an unprecedented strain on our health care system. Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be the darkest winter in modern history.
While President Trump is pushing to reopen America and has clashed with state governors over shutdown orders, Bright said the government needs to give the American people ""one message in a voice that is clear, consistent, trustworthy, and backed by the best science available.""
""As my colleague Dr. Anthony Fauci testified on May 12, 2020, we must not rush blindly, or act too quickly, in returning to our daily lives,"" Bright wrote. ""If we ignore the science, we stand a dramatically increased risk of worsening the spread of the virus in the coming months. This could lead to more widespread outbreaks and to many more lives lost throughout the remainder of this year.""
New normal wont be easy to achieve
Bright wrote that ""the normal of 2019 is not going to return, but we all have an opportunity to shape the new normal of 2020 and beyond."" It will take ""the participation and cooperation of every American"" to achieve that, he said.
""Today, we need clear and simple messages to teach us how wear a face cover, when and how to safely go outside or back to work or back to school. It's that simple,"" he wrote.
Bright said he believes a COVID-19 cure will be found. But in the meantime, he wrote that the US must increase public education about hand-washing, social distancing, face coverings, and self-monitoring; ramp up production of ""critical supplies and protective gear"" for medical workers and first responders; distribute equipment and supplies equitably in order to ""eliminate the state-vs.-state competition""; and develop ""a national testing strategy.""
""We need tests that are accurate, rapid, easy to use, low cost, and available to everyone who needs them. We need be able to trust the results so that we can trace contacts, isolate, and quarantine appropriately while striving to develop a cure,"" he said.
Whistleblower investigation continues
As we wrote last week, Bright's whistleblower complaint to the US Office of Special Counsel details how the Trump administration's COVID-19 response was hampered by cronyism and denial about the virus's severity. Bright says his early warnings about the pandemic and shortages of critical medical supplies were largely ignored and that he was transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in a ""retaliatory demotion.""
Trump dismissed Bright as ""a disgruntled employee who's trying to help the Democrats win an election,"" according to NPR. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the agency ""strongly disagrees with the allegations and characterizations in the complaint from Dr. Bright.""
But the Office of Special Counsel's preliminary investigation found ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that the Trump administration retaliated against Bright in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, according to Bright's lawyers. (The Office of Special Counsel doesn't comment on open investigations.) An in-depth investigation by the Office is ongoing, and the Trump administration's handling of Bright is likely to be discussed at tomorrow's hearing.
Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), who chairs the subcommittee and scheduled tomorrow's hearing, said last week that Bright's ""complaint deserves examination.""
""Dr. Bright's whistleblower complaint raises serious concerns about the administration's COVID-19 response including alleged gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, and scientific censorship,"" Eshoo said."

29 with 20 posters participating
President Donald Trump believes that America is the world's champion when it comes to coronavirus testing.
""In the span of just a few short months, weve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and its not even close,"" Trump said in a Monday press conference. He noted that daily testing has risen from around 150,000 per day three weeks ago to around 300,000 per day this week and that the US was on track to surpass 10 million tests this week (we reached that milestone on Thursday).
Trump is correct in one respect: the US has performed more coronavirus tests than any other country with the possible exception of China. But by most other measures, the American testing effort is mediocre at best.
Let's start with per capita testing capacity. In his Monday briefing, Trump said that ""we're testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries."" It's truebarelythat the US is doing better than these countries.
Early in the coronavirus crisis, the US was a testing laggard. Regulatory problems slowed the development of tests in February, and as a result, we had a lot of ground to make up in late March and April. But in the last month, the US has surpassed a number of other countries in per-capita terms.
However, the US is far from being the world's leader in per capita testing. Denmark, Russia, Australia, and several other countries are conducting more tests per person than the US.
The larger problem, however, is that tests per capita isn't the best way to evaluate a country's testing performance. What ultimately matters isn't tests per person, it's tests per person positive for COVID-19 because you need a high ratio in order to get a clear picture of the pandemic's progression. And on this score, the US is still way behind:
The US leads the world in the absolute number of coronavirus tests, with more than 10 million completed. But we also lead the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, at more than 1.4 million. If you divide 10 million by 1.4 million, you get around seven tests per coronavirus case. Other countries have had far more testing capacity over the course of their epidemics.
A lack of testing capacity particularly hampered our COVID-fighting efforts in March and early April. At that time, testing was focused on severe COVID-19 cases and health care workers because we didn't have enough tests for others. People with milder COVID-like symptoms were often sent home without being tested, and there was little to no spare capacity for testing friends, family, and coworkers who had come into contact with COVID-19 patients.
Fortunately, America's testing ratio has been improving over time. On Thursday, for example, there were 366,944 test results, producing 25,203 new confirmed cases. That's a ratio of more than 14 tests per confirmed case. Or to put it another way, about 6.9 percent of coronavirus tests conducted yesterday were positive.
That's a good sign because ample testing is helpful for getting the spread of the coronavirus under controlespecially as some states begin to relax quarantine restrictions. But it's not time to declare victory yet. The countries with the best track records fighting the coronaviruscountries like Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealandhave conducted dozens of tests for every infection. Moreover, with many states relaxing their lockdown rules, there's a risk that infections will start to climb again. If that happens, we'll want to be ready with plenty of spare testing capacity."

How much of an immune response does a SARS-CoV-2 infection produce? It's a critical question for all sorts of reasons. To begin with, long-lasting immunity, either through an infection or a vaccine, is critical for any hope of returning the world to something that resembles its pre-pandemic state. It's also essential to understanding how safe people who have recovered from infections are and how they can behave in the face of continued outbreaks and spread.
But there are also more subtle public policy issues. Since testing wasn't generally available at the time of many outbreaks, we'll need antibody tests to figure out who was actually exposed. And the accuracy of those testswhich has been called into questioncan have a big influence on studies of the pandemic's progression.
A bunch of recent draft papers have looked at the sort of immune response we're seeing in patients who have cleared the virus after testing positive for it. And the results suggest that it's very variableas is the quality of the tests that detect it. (We'll remind you that pre-publication documents carry some quality risks.)
Testing 1, 2, 3, 4
One of the more comprehensive studies on the subject comes from the New York Blood Center. That organization was serving as the clearinghouse for tests of whether the antibodies of those who have cleared the infection could be used to help patients with COVID-19. So, it had access to a large collection of samples from people who were known to have been infected. A research team based there used those samples to test both the immune response in these individuals and the ability of tests to assay it.
Several of these tests looked at whether antibodies against the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were present at all. One of those test is called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA. This produces a high-quality, quantitative measure of the number of antibodies that recognize a specific protein. But it's not very amenable to automation, and it tends to require researchers to perform the tests by hand.
There are high-throughput diagnostic tests that work on similar principles to the ELISA, and they are typically used by centralized testing facilities. The researchers had access to these tests from two different commercial sources at the Blood Center. Finally, they also obtained a variety of small antibody testing kits of the sort that might be sold to the general public.
For the sophisticated tests, the results were generally good. Out of a population of 370 individuals that had had their infection confirmed while active, the ELISA test done in the labs showed that over 96 percent had detectable antibodies to one of the viral proteins. Testing against two other viral proteins showed 85 and 89 percent of the population had antibodies. Only about 2 percent had no detectable antibodies using this assay.
Things were good when the high-throughput diagnostic machines were used to run tests. These picked up antibodies in 91 and 96 percent of the population, depending on the manufacturer. The small commercial tests, however, didn't do especially well, with less than 80 percent of them correctly identifying the presence of antibodies.
The researchers did perform a small number of tests on negative controlssamples taken from donors prior to when SARS-CoV-2 reached the United States. While these were enough to show that the tests were working properly, they didn't look at enough negative control samples to determine whether any of the tests had a high frequency of false positives.
Variations
As we mentioned above, the more sophisticated assays used here don't just detect the presence or absence of antibodiesthey provide an estimate of how much is present. And here, the researchers found that the quantities varied widely. The difference between the highest and lowest values produced by the test varied by a factor of over 1,000.
It's difficult to know whether that means that the higher immune responses are more effective, however. Some antibodies are what is termed ""neutralizing,"" in that they bind to the virus in a way that keeps it from infecting cells. So, the researchers engineered the coronavirus' spike protein into an unrelated virus and used that to infect cultured cells in the presence of antibodies from all these donors. This provided a measure of how often neutralizing antibodies were present.
The vast majority (between 80 and 90 percent) of the donors had some level of neutralizing antibody. But the levels of neutralization went up roughly in line with the amount of antibody presentwhich, as we've just discussed, varies considerably. The end result is that the levels of neutralizing antibody varied over a range of 40,000-fold differences. Unfortunately, this means that, in all likelihood, the variability of the antibodies we see roughly correlates with the amount of protection they're likely to offer. (Neutralizing antibodies haven't yet been demonstrated to be effective in patients.)
Waiting for the herd
While this is a draft paper and should be viewed cautiously, the results are largely in line with a separate draft study of 175 patients done by an unrelated group of researchers in China. This also saw high levels of variability and a small subset of patients that had no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Another group based in New York found even higher levels of variability, but it found neutralizing antibodies in most patients, even if they were rare.
There have also been a number of draft studies that suggest that the levels of antibody produced correlate roughly with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms that a person experienced.
For now, what do we conclude from all of this? The first is that, to get a more accurate picture of who has actually experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection, we're going to want to rely on high-throughput assays. Right now, the smaller personal kits may be helpful for people who are interested in getting a rough picture of their own medical history, but the results aren't up to the quality we'd want for understanding the public's exposure.
The second thing is that SARS-CoV-2 infection isn't necessarily producing a robust immunity. We don't really know what levels of neutralizing antibodies are actually protective, but it's clear that a lot of people don't produce many of them after an infection. Which means any plans for generating herd immunity by allowing a controlled level of infection have to be viewed with extreme skepticism at this point. And vaccine developers will need to ensure that the infections produce a consistently high-level response that includes neutralizing antibodies."

States and cities all but completely shut down earlier this year in an attempt to stem the spread of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Many of those state and local authorities have now eased up on restrictions, allowing people to return to their pre-pandemic habits and behaviors. In many of those regions, COVID-19 cases are now on the rise, but the White House is pushing the message that COVID-19 spikes are due to an increase in testing and nothing more.
President Donald Trump said during a meeting on Monday, ""If we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."" Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on that messaging in a call with several states governors later in the day, trying to downplay any new outbreaks in their states.
""I would just encourage you all, as we talk about these things, to make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,"" Pence told the governors, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times.
The Vice President has headed up the administration's official coronavirus response task force since late February. That task force has consistently sidelined critics and downplayed expertise in an apparent effort to move past the pandemic's economic effects as quickly as possible. 
Pence echoed Trump in referring to pockets where COVID-19 exists as ""embers,"" a framing that was echoed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Certain locations, such as nursing homes and particularly meat-processing plants, have seen large outbreaks. ""If any of them light on fire,"" Azar said, speaking metaphorically, ""We've got to get there right away.""
Pence added:
Encourage people with the news that we are safely reopening the country. That, as we speak today, because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up. But according to our most current information, hospitalizations for coronavirus are going down across the country.
Unfortunately, Pence was wrong. According to pretty much all major trackers (Johns Hopkins University, New York Times, NPR) COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations are on the rise in well over a dozen states.
Back to the bad days
More than 2.1 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 this year, and more than 110,000 have died. The consequences, however, have not been evenly spread. Early on, urban hot spots such as Seattle and New York City seemed to account for a high percentage of the ill. Six months into the year, the disease is much more widespread.
Increased testing does result in increased diagnosis but only up to a point. Testing zero people will certainly result in zero positive results, that much is true. During the first weeks and months of the pandemic, the US did indeed have woefully insufficient testing capacity, and so every newly available batch of tests seemed to make the data spike. 
But the testing situation has roughly stabilized, with an average of 461,000 tests performed per day in June, and we now have clearer data available about positivity ratesthe number of performed tests that come back positive for SARS-CoV-2.
If testing is up and the prevalence of the disease is stable or decreasing, you should see a lower positivity rate in the data on average. For example, if you hypothetically tested an average of 1,000 people per day for a week, and an average of 50 tests per day came back positive, you'd have a 5 percent positivity rate. If you increased that hypothetical testing capacity to an average of 1,500 people per day, and the case levels were stable or dropping, you might still see about 50 positives per dayabout a 3 percent positivity rate. But if you keep testing capacity at 1,500 people per day and start to see 100 cases per day, your positive rate is now up to more than 6 percent, and your local case counts are growing.
States
For example, Virginia's current positivity, as of June 16, stands at 7.4 percent according to state data. That's a significant improvement for the commonwealth, overall: in April, the rate peaked at a high of more than 20 percent and has been generally working its way downward since then as testing increased.
Arizona, on the other hand, is on the opposite trajectory. Although it reports an overall positivity rate of 8.7 percent, state data shows that number has been going up every week since May 17. Last week, the state hit a record high of 14 percent positivity, and so faras of June 16the rate for this week stands at 21 percent. (That may decrease as more test results come in during the rest of the week.)
Similar situations are unfolding elsewhere. For example, Texas reported record-high COVID-19 hospitalizations on Monday, according to The Texas Tribune. North Carolina also recorded a hospitalization high on Monday, according to the state. And Oregon, after a long decrease in hospitalizations, began to see those numbers creep back up again in June, coinciding with a stark increase in new cases, The Oregonian reports.
Public health experts in Arizona have linked that increase to the state's early reopening efforts. The increase was not unforeseeableeven by the administration. Trump in May said in an interview that he expected ""there'll be more death"" as the country came back online, telling ABC News, ""Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."""

19 with 17 posters participating
The Trump administration is threatening to sue states and municipalities whose pandemic orders infringe on people's rights or cause ""undue interference with the national economy.""
""I am directing each of our United States Attorneys to also be on the lookout for state and local directives that could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens,"" US Attorney General William Barr wrote yesterday in a memo to all 94 US attorneys' offices. The Barr memo said that ""even in times of emergency, when reasonable and temporary restrictions are placed on rights, the First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers."" The memo is available at The Washington Post website.
Barr's memo is not just aimed at protecting members of religious groups. He continued:
The legal restrictions on state and local authority are not limited to discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers. For example, the Constitution also forbids, in certain circumstances, discrimination against disfavored speech and undue interference with the national economy. If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court.
Barr wrote that he is ""therefore directing the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and Matthew Schneider, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, to oversee and coordinate our efforts to monitor state and local policies and, if necessary, take action to correct them."" While Barr said US officials ""do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,"" he noted that ""the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.""
Disturbingly close to house arrest
The memo did not detail what kinds of restrictions would cause the United States to sue states or cities, and it did not say whether the US will challenge any measures that are already in place. But Barr wrote that local restrictions, while ""necessary in order to stop the spread of a deadly disease,"" have ""imposed tremendous burdens on the daily lives of all Americans.""
Barr previously criticized local policies in interviews, saying that ""the idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest,"" according to a Fox News article last week. ""We're looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,"" Barr said. ""And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they're not and people bring lawsuits, we file [a] statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.""
The Justice Department has so far ""intervened in only a single lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions, appearing to back a Greenville, Miss., church which had sued over the city's efforts to shut down drive-in religious services,"" The Washington Post wrote. The Justice Department ""did not unequivocally support Temple Baptist Church in its legal statement of interest, though it said the circumstances the church described 'suggest that the city singled out churches for distinctive treatment,' which would be unconstitutional.""
Trump threatened states
President Trump on April 13 claimed he has ""total"" authority to override governors and force states to reopen their economies even while the coronavirus pandemic continues. ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be. It's total, and the governors know that,"" Trump said at a press conference.
That isn't how it works, as states and local governments have police powers to protect the health and safety of residents with measures such as isolation and quarantines. But Trump's claim and related developments showed that at least some states aren't likely to succumb to federal pressure to reopen their economies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would not follow a presidential order requiring him to lift pandemic orders. Shortly before Trump's claim, coalitions of governors on the East and West Coasts announced pacts to follow science, not politics, in their decisions on when to reopen economies.
Trump backed down just one day later, saying ""I'm not going to put pressure on any governor to open."" However, Barr's letter signals that the Trump administration is not done pressuring states to lift pandemic orders."

New York Attorney General Letitia James hasn't been impressed with Amazon's response to the coronavirus crisis.
""While we continue to investigate, the information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon's health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,"" James' staff wrote in an April 22 letter first obtained by National Public Radio.
The crisis has produced surging demand for Amazon's delivery services. But as Amazon has hired an extra 175,000 people to help fill orders, it has also faced criticism about its safety practices. Last month, a number of workers (Amazon counted 15, organizers claimed 60) protested outside a massive Amazon fulfillment center on Staten Island. Amazon has also seen sporadic online protests in recent weeks.
The Staten Island protesters wanted their facility shut down for a deep cleaning. Amazon workers have also called for universal paid sick leave and stronger efforts to keep workers separated during work hours.
But Amazon says that it is doing everything it can to protect its workers from the coronavirus.
""We made over 150 process updatesfrom enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to new efforts like disinfectant spraying,"" a spokeswoman told Ars by email. ""We distributed personal protective gear, such as masks for our employees, and implemented disinfectant spraying and temperature checks across our operations worldwide.""
In their letter, New York officials also questioned Amazon's decision to fire Chris Smalls, one of the organizers of the Staten Island protest. Smalls accused Amazon of retaliating against him for his organizing efforts. Amazon insists that Smalls was fired for defying a stay-at-home order after he came into contact with an infected co-worker.
James' office writes that their findings so far ""raise serious concern that Amazon may have discharged [Smalls] in order to silence his complaints and send a threatening message to other employees that they should also keep quiet about any health and safety concerns.""
""This Office has learned that many workers are fearful about speaking out about their concerns following the termination of Mr. Smalls' employment,"" the letter added. ""This is a particularly dangerous message to send during a pandemic, when chilling worker speech about health and safety practices could literally be a matter of life and death.""
But Amazon says it has done nothing wrong.
""We did not terminate Mr. Smalls employment for organizing a 15-person protest,"" Amazon said by email. ""We terminated his employment for putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of his employment. Mr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.""
Amazon says Smalls was instructed to stay home for 14 days after he came into contact with a coworker who had COVID-19 and that Smalls came to work anyway to help lead the protest.
Whatever the reasons for Smalls' termination, a leaked internal memo suggests that Amazon may have had a deliberate strategy to make him the face of worker organizing at Amazon.
Hes not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how were trying to protect workers, Amazon's general counsel wrote."

President Trump yesterday threatened to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization and withdraw the US from the WHO entirely.
In a letter to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump alleged that ""the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world"" and that the WHO must ""demonstrate independence from China.""
""[I]f the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization,"" Trump wrote. ""I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to nance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America's interests.""
Trump posted the letter on Twitter, writing, ""It is self-explanatory!""
Trump has repeatedly denied any responsibility for COVID-19 spreading in America and said on April 14 that the US would temporarily halt funding the WHO until his administration completed a review of the group's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump's letter yesterday said that ""review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization's alarming lack of independence from the People's Republic of China.""
Trump previously said his administration was considering various proposals, including one in which the US would pay only 10 percent of its former contribution to the WHO. The US would have to exit WHO in order to stop funding it entirely because the group charges membership dues. The US also makes voluntary contributions to the organization.
Trump letter makes false claim
Trump's letter then lists a series of claims, the first being that the WHO ""consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal.""
The Lancet quickly issued a response explaining that Trump is wrong. ""This statement is factually incorrect,"" The Lancet said. ""The Lancet published no report in December, 2019, referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China."" The Lancet's first reports on the topic were published on January 24, 2020 the statement said.
""The allegations leveled against WHO in President Trump's letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic,"" The Lancet said. ""It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.""
A WHO spokesperson told Ars today that ""WHO acknowledges receipt of the letter from the President of the United States. We are considering the contents of the letter."" Last month, the WHO responded to Trump's temporary funding freeze with a call for global unity in the fight against the virus.
Trump may not be able to permanently end funding to the WHO unilaterally. The Wall Street Journal wrote last month that ""congressional Democrats say Mr. Trump can't cut WHO funding on his own,"" but that the ""White House budget office has concluded the president has several options to withhold money from the WHO without congressional approval,"" such as by ""order[ing] agencies to reroute the money to other related purposes.""
Trump still focused on travel ban
The US generally provides about 15 percent of the WHO's budget and gave the organization $893 million during the WHO's two-year funding cycle that ended on December 31. The US was reportedly already late on its payments to the WHO when Trump announced a temporary funding freeze.
Trump's letter yesterday said, ""Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged 'transparency.'"" Trump's letter did not mention that Trump himself praised China for its ""transparency"" on January 24 or that Trump repeatedly praised China for its coronavirus response throughout February.
Trump is also still mad at the WHO for its response to his travel ban. Trump wrote:
You also strongly praised China's strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were ""causing more harm than good."" Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world.
Despite Trump's claim, a USA Today article on April 11 said, ""there is no public record of WHO at any point actively criticizing the US or any other country for deciding to implement a coronavirus-related travel ban"" and that the WHO ""opposes all travel bans during a pandemic, not just Trump's."" The WHO on January 24 said it ""advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event.""
Health experts say Trump's travel ban had little effect on the pandemic's spread. Trump continued to downplay the virus's severity by comparing it to the flu as late as March 24, nearly two months after the WHO declared a global health emergency. Trump has also fought state governors over their cautious approaches to reopening the economy.
""I'm tired of those who bear the responsibility accepting none of it while deflecting blame on others, [including] the previous administration, the World Health Organization, the Wuhan lab, anywhere but where the blame belongs,"" US Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) said last week at a hearing on a whistleblower complaint that says the Trump administration's COVID-19 response was hampered by cronyism and denial about the virus's severity."

Twitter user @didgeridougrou posted a viral tweet on Tuesday, in which they surfaced an old clip from the animated series that sure seems a lot like our plight in 2020.
In the clip, Springfield townsfolk clamor and shout at Dr. Hibbert for a cure for a disease, but the doctor tells them bedrest is all he can prescribe. And despite the Gilead drug Remdesivir getting FDA approval to help treat COVID-19 patients, Hibbert's proclamation that there is no cure sure sounds a lot like coronavirus. 
Next in the clip, the panicked townsfolk accidentally unleash killer bees in a truck, which, yep, sounds a lot like murder hornets. It's all pretty eerie. 
The Simpsons predicting the future is a well-trod trend. Everything from smartwatches, to corporate mergers, to Game of Thrones plot-twists have seemingly been predicted by the show. 
Of course, given more context, the 1993 episode didn't really predict 2020. The clip comes from the 1993 episode ""Marge in Chains,"" during which the town is hit with an epidemic of the fictional Osaka Flu. The sickness is played off in a cartoonish, funny way, with clouds of the illness strutting around town. 
Memes replacing the Osaka Flu with coronavirus actually first began going around in February, well before the added bit of ""killer bee"" coincidence. Unfortunately, some trolls also used the '93 episode to spread racist imagery, unlike the more recent viral tweet.
""I don't like it being used for nefarious purposes,"" episode co-writer Bill Oakley told The Hollywood Reporterin March. ""The idea that anyone misappropriates it to make coronavirus seem like an Asian plot is terrible. In terms of trying to place blame on Asia I think that is gross."""

""One day he's going to call a press conference to reassure us that murder hornets are fake news while a dozen of them carry him back to their nest.""
Trump also appeared on Fox News to deliver possibly the worst Mother's Day message a U.S. president has ever delivered. F-35 fighter jets were mentioned more times than mothers were which wasn't really a feat considering Trump's Mother's Day message referenced moms exactly zero times.

In more ways than one.
Lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder went viral last weekend after lurking around Florida beaches dressed as death himself in protest of beachgoers enjoying the sun without proper social distancing, putting their communities at risk of COVID-19. While many states around the country are extending their stay-at-home mandates, others, like Georgia, are easing into reopening nonessential businesses. 
Uhlfelder is not a fan he, along with health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, are cautious of society returning to normal so soon. He made an appearance on a local ABC station Friday to warn Floridians against flocking to beaches while the pandemic rages on.
And obviously he did it dressed as the Grim Reaper. In the most 2020 scene imaginable, reporter Faith Graham handed the mic over to the death himself for comment. 
""I'm a huge proponent of public beaches and I've been fighting for that for years, but I think the danger of bringing people here to the area and spreading the virus,"" the Reaper appeared to say. ""I think it's going to prolong the recovery we have and I think that we should take better measures...It's too soon and it's not appropriate."" 
It's something. So is Graham's full report, below.
Personally, I thought the Grim Reaper would sound more soulless than Uhlfelder, but the lawyer does bring a sobering visual to the beach. The Centers for Disease Control still recommends staying at home, washing your hands, and covering your face if possible to avoid contracting and spreading the coronavirus. 
And if you think for a second that you should attend a large gathering, just think of the Reaper."

You can read the full statement below. The company didn’t directly address instances where tip baiting has happened or say if it would adjust behavior. It does have a few mild measures in place to discourage zeroing out tips, however, such as forcing customers to manually set the tip to $0 and setting the default to at least 5 percent even if it was lower for the last order.
It’s a complex situation. The ability to change tips after delivery is commonplace among grocery and restaurant delivery apps, and is meant to protect customers against shoddy service. Instacart shoppers, for example, are theoretically more likely to treat you well if they know you could reduce their tip. However, many of these app-based workers also depend on tips to make a decent living — the absence of a guarantee for their tips could leave them in financial distress. If the FTC intervenes, it may have to strike a careful balance where it both protects workers and gives customers a way to address poor service.
“Our goal is to deliver a high-quality experience for both customers and shoppers. By allowing customers to tip after delivery based on their overall service, we see shopper tips increase or stay the same on 99.5% of orders. Additionally, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in North America, shoppers' earnings from tips have nearly doubled. Tips are always separate from any Instacart earnings and all tips go directly to the shopper.”"

Facebook didn’t specify exactly who was behind the effort, only that the “investigation found links to individuals associated with QAnon.” 
Facebook’s Head of Security Policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said the accounts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic, but that “we’ve seen them opportunistically leverage COVID-related topics.” 
Examples of the posts shared by the QAnon-linked accounts removed by Facebook.
“They frequently posted about news and topics including the upcoming presidential election and candidates, the current US administration, anti-Semitic and anti-Asian conspiracies, and COVID-19,” Facebook wrote in a report on the takedowns. “While it did not appear to be the focus of this campaign, some of the individuals behind this effort attempted to monetize their clickbait content by selling t-shirts and other merchandise.”
As NBC News points out, the pages  represent only a “fraction” of QAnon supporters’ Facebook presence. While Facebook aims to debunk and hide conspiracy theories and misinformation, the company doesn’t remove posts that don’t otherwise violate their rules. 
Together, the five pages, 20 accounts, and six groups reached more than 150,000 Facebook users, the company said. One hundred and thirty-three thousand users had followed at least one of the pages, and 30,000 had joined at least one of the groups. While that’s a tiny subset of Facebook’s 195 million US users, it still highlights how a small number of “fringe” accounts can gain relatively wide distribution on the social network."

But it's unclear whether the patients fared better because of the famotidine or if it was a coincidence.
""Based on what we've learned in this study, it's encouraging,"" said Dr. Joseph Conigliaro, a coauthor of the paper and a physician at Northwell Health. ""This association is actually really compelling.""
The drug, famotidine, has been on the market for nearly 40 years and is an active ingredient in the popular over-the-counter heartburn treatment Pepcid.
Among the 1,536 patients in the study who were not taking famotidine, 332, or 22%, either died or were intubated and put on a ventilator. Among the 84 patients who were taking famotidine, 8, or 10%, died or were put on a ventilator.
""Compared to the rest of the patients, those who received famotidine had a greater than 2-fold decreased risk of either dying or being intubated,"" according to a statement by authors of the study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. 
The patients who were taking famotidine started the drug within 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital. Some took it orally and some intravenously, at varying dosages. About 15% of them were already taking it at home. 
The study doesn't prove the drug caused the lower death rate -- it's possible that it's just a coincidence.
""It is not clear why those patients who received famotidine had improved outcomes,"" the authors wrote in their statement. ""This is merely an association, and these findings should not be interpreted to mean that famotidine improves outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.""
Doctor cautions against starting famotidine
The study was published on medrxiv.org, a preprint server founded by Yale University, the medical journal BMJ and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Articles on this server have not been reviewed by authors' scientific peers.
Based on these results, Conigliaro said he knows that doctors might start prescribing famotidine to their coronavirus patients now, before the results of the clinical trial are known, but he doesn't recommend it.
""I think doctors should wait for more data from the prospective trial,"" he said.
He added that there's no evidence famotidine prevents infection, and he's concerned that people who don't have Covid-19 will start taking it.
""I would really caution against this. Taking famotidine might give them a false sense of security,"" he said.
Only a clinical trial, where patients are randomly assigned to get either famotidine or a placebo and then studied, can determine if the drug really works against Covid-19.
Northwell and Columbia are now doing a clinical trial where some patients are receiving intravenous famotidine at a dosage nine times higher than what is given for heartburn. Others are receiving a placebo, or a drug that does nothing. Conigliaro, who's heading up that trial, said preliminary results would likely be announced in a few months.
He said 233 patients have been enrolled in the study, and Northwell had planned to announce preliminary results when they enrolled 390 patients. However, since the number of patients with coronavirus in New York has declined, they might decide to announce the preliminary results with fewer patients. 
'We don't know if it has any benefit'
It has a bit of a mystery why a heartburn medicine might help someone with a viral infection.
""A month ago when we were approached with the idea to start up the trial, I really did a double take,"" Conigliaro said.
The Northwell doctors decided to study famotidine for two reasons.
One, a computer modeling study showed that the famotidine's mechanism of action -- the way it fights heartburn and reflux -- might also help against Covid-19.
Two, Dr. Michael Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who worked with coronavirus patients in China, observed that lower income patients with heartburn were surviving longer than their wealthier counterparts who also had heartburn.
When Callahan and the Chinese doctors looked closer, they found that many of the people with lower incomes were taking famotidine, whereas the wealthier patients tended to take a different, more expensive drug.
""The poor peasants really seemed to do well on famotidine,"" said Dr. Kevin Tracey, president of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, said. ""There are a lot of anecdotes passing around that give us some hope.""
While these observations in China -- and now New York -- might point the way to famotidine as a treatment for Covid-19, the researchers emphasized that only the clinical trial can determine for sure whether the drug works against the virus. 
""We don't know if it has any benefit. We really don't. I swear we don't,"" Tracey previously told CNN. ""People are hoping for anything. But we need to do this clinical trial.""
He added that if famotidine works, it would be easy to use it on a widespread scale.
""It's generic, it's plentiful and it's inexpensive,"" he said."

""From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,"" Van Kerkhove said on Monday.
""We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They're following asymptomatic cases, they're following contacts and they're not finding secondary transmission onward. It is very rare -- and much of that is not published in the literature,"" she said. ""We are constantly looking at this data and we're trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.""
Van Kerkhove went on to describe how the novel coronavirus, a respiratory pathogen, spreads through droplets, which can be released when someone coughs or sneezes.
""It passes from an individual through infectious droplets. If we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases, isolated those cases, followed the contacts and quarantined those cases, we would drastically reduce -- I would love to be able to give a proportion of how much transmission we would actually stop -- but it would be a drastic reduction in transmission,"" she said.
Van Kerkhove also said that what appear to be asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 often turn out to be cases of mild disease.
""When we actually go back and we say how many of them were truly asymptomatic, we find out that many have really mild disease,"" Van Kerkhove said. 
""They're not quote-unquote Covid symptoms, meaning they may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath -- but some may have mild disease,"" she said. ""Having said that, we do know that there can be people who are truly asymptomatic.""
Many people with Covid-19 who may appear to be asymptomatic actually could just have mild or atypical symptoms -- or they could be pre-symptomatic, Dr. Manisha Juthani, an infectious diseases specialist and associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine, said in an email to CNN on Monday.
Pre-symptomatic refers to the early stages of an illness, before symptoms have developed, whereas asymptomatic may refer to having no symptoms throughout the course of an infection -- a distinction that Van Kerkhove hinted at during Monday's media briefing.
Juthani, who did not participate in the media briefing and has not reviewed the unpublished data Van Kerkhove cited, said those findings are not necessarily inconsistent with other estimates regarding how pre-symptomatic spread of the coronavirus can occur. 
A study in April found that viral shedding -- when people may be able to infect others -- could begin two to three days before symptoms appeared. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in planning scenarios that 40% of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick. 
""These patients weren't asymptomatic,"" Juthani said. Rather, they were ""spreading disease before becoming symptomatic.""
Overall, ""these findings suggest that if we quarantine and contact trace symptomatic people, we can make a significant dent in the pandemic,"" Juthani said.
Making this distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections remains important -- but also between ""paucisymptomatic infections,"" which refers to having atypical or very mild symptoms, Babak Javid, a principal investigator at Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing and consultant in infectious disease at Cambridge University Hospitals, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Monday.
""Detailed contact tracing from Taiwan as well as the first European transmission chain in Germany suggested that true asymptomatics rarely transmit. However, those (and many other) studies have found that paucisymptomatic transmission can occur, and in particular, in the German study, they found that transmission often appeared to occur before or on the day symptoms first appeared,"" Javid said in the statement.
""Other data available, from studies in several continents confirming that presymptomatic transmission does occur, would suggest that being well does not necessarily mean one cannot transmit SARS-CoV-2,"" Javid said in part. ""This has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries.""

There's so much of a push that some scientists think these treatments may be available this year, even before a vaccine. 
Antibodies are the proteins the body makes to fight infection.
Since the Victorian era, scientists have harnessed this natural protection for treatments. 
During the 1918 flu pandemic, doctors proved convalescent plasma -- antibody-filled blood plasma from patients who recovered from the disease -- could fight flu. Convalescent plasma has been used to treat severe flu, MERS and SARS and now some US doctors are starting to see some success treating Covid-19, too.
Since there isn't enough donated plasma to treat all patients, modern medicine can fill in the gaps and maybe even improve the process. Scientists can create what are called monoclonal antibodies: lab-made antibodies created specifically to target an infection.
Vaccines have the advantage of working longer than an antibody treatment. Antibody therapies potentially last a month or two and then wear off, but they can be used to temporarily protect vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents or healthcare workers or people with chronic conditions. The therapies could also treat people who are already sick with Covid-19.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said these therapies will be essential in the fight against Covid-19.
""Right now we have a major push on a program to develop monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune globulin, all of which are founded on the same principle of using an antibody that is directed against the virus for either prophylaxis or treatment,"" Fauci said in an interview with JAMA on June 8. ""I think you're going to see it's going to be for both. We'd like to have available for those who are at riskthe elderly and those with underlying conditionseither monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. That's a very, very high priority.""
Currently there are at least 102 Covid-19 antibody treatments in various stages of development, according to David Thomas, vice president of Industry Research at BIO, the trade association representing the biotechnology industry. Thomas does the research that goes into his organization's Covid-19 therapeutic development tracker. He said there are so many treatments under development, it's hard to keep up.
""I never looked at it to grow this big, this fast, and I've worked on all different therapeutic areas from Alzheimer's to cancer, and to see a pipeline of this size and this breadth is amazing,"" Thomas said. 
Thomas said some therapies are designed to treat the secondary effects of Covid-19 such as inflammation. Others are being designed to kill the coronavirus itself. 
Compared to other diseases, the research and development of Covid-19 treatments are moving at ""light speed,"" Thomas said. 
Four monoclonal antibody treatments made to treat and possibly even prevent Covid-19 infection already went into human trials in June. 
Indianapolis-based pharma giant Eli Lilly has two. One was developed in collaboration with AbCellera, a biotechnology company based in Canada. Another was developed with Junshi Biosciences. 
The antibody Lilly developed with AbCellera called LY-CoV555 is now in a Phase 2 clinical trial of non-hospitalized patients. That study is currently enrolling patients. Lilly said in the future it will also test additional antibodies and experiment with different combinations to see which work best. 
Regeneron is testing its antibody cocktail in patients in the US. The New York-based biotech company is enrolling hospitalized and ambulatory patients with Covid-19 in the initial safety/virology phase of the trial, spokesperson Alexandra Bowie said this week. The company hopes to have preliminary data in the next one to two months. They are scaling up manufacturing to create hundreds of thousands of doses by August 2020, dedicating their entire manufacturing plant in upstate New York to the effort.
There is also another effort from Tychan, a biotech company based in Singapore, that has launched a Phase 1 clinical trial in hospitalized patients there. The company said this part of the trial will take about six weeks.
It's likely, if all goes well in the first phrases of the trials, therapies could advance to the next phases sometime this summer, the companies said, and treatments could potentially be available by the fall. Although, some scientists say, not everything works as planned in real life.
""Sometimes antibodies that work in the lab and neutralized really well aren't as effective when they are used in animal models or humans, so it's always a little bit tricky,"" said Phyllis Kanki, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sometimes it can take time to get the antibody cocktail right, Kanki said.
However, Thomas of BIO,said the industry has built up a lot of antibody therapy development expertise over the years in creating treatments to fight cancer and autoimmune disease. 
In addition to therapies specifically designed to fight the novel coronavirus, companies are also looking to repurpose some of their existing monoclonal antibody treatments as potential Covid-19 treatments. 
Novartis, for example, is in a phase 3 trial of the drug canakinumab against coronavirus. This interleukin-1beta blocker is FDA-approved to treat certain rare types of periodic fever syndromes, also called auto-inflammatory syndromes.
The company hopes canakinumab can be used to treat patients whose Covid-19 infection has caused a condition called cytokine release syndrome, or cytokine storm. where the body's immune system overreacts to the infection and harms the body. That trial is currently enrolling patients in the US. 
China-based biotech company I-Mab said it also hopes to have the results by August from its trial of an antibody therapy, which it is currently testing on cytokine storm patients, so it could potentially offer a treatment by early fall.
Humanigen's lenzilumab also seems to be working against cytokine storms, according to a small study from scientists at the Mayo Clinic. That Phase 3 trial is ongoing.
Several other therapies are still being tested in the lab. A South Dakota company, SAB Biotherapeutics, said it plans to start human trials with its antibody treatment derived from the plasma of cattle in July.
Most experts think that the world could have an antibody treatment sooner than a vaccine, although vaccine development is moving along at a record pace, too.

 (CNN)Many governors are opening up their states as part of the White House effort to reopen the country. But as a pandemic expert who has been warning about diseases like Covid-19 for nearly 15 years, my message to Americans is simple: save yourselves, your families and your communities by staying at home and ignoring your governor's ""ludicrous"" policies.
Citizens should know that reopening states is very unlikely to restore economic well-being. In fact, prematurely reopening society would likely cause the disease to escalate and lead to prolonged economic hardship. Every public interaction will endanger our health, causing sickness and death and further burdening our healthcare system. Other countries could forbid their citizens from visiting the United States, and Americans could be barred from much of the world. Even trade may be viewed as an unacceptable risk. 
But, based on research I've conducted, I believe that if we take a more aggressive approach now and keep towns and cities locked down, we can defeat Covid-19 in four to six weeks. This would allow enough time for those currently infected -- and anyone they may have infected -- to recover or seek medical treatment.
More than a dozen countries have flattened the curve and substantially decreased daily new infections by ensuring strong lockdowns, facemasks for everyone, strict travel restrictions and isolation of infected individuals away from home. Countries that have not imposed sufficiently strict measures, like the US, continue to struggle to contain infection rates. 
But even within the US, some local and state governments are doing the right thing and succeeding. New York City and Louisiana are now at one-fourth to one-third of the daily cases they registered at their peaks. Every community, large or small, that implements strong measures will see the same success. But we need strong commitment to do what it takes to win quickly and decisively at the level of the individual, family and community.
In March, I called on the US to impose a strict five-week national lockdown with internal and external travel restrictions to bring us to near zero infections. While measures were taken in many parts of the country, it was too little, too late. 
Now, I and many others are issuing another warning: the decisions of some US governors to prematurely ease social distancing is a disastrous mistake and citizens need to ignore them. Our research -- and common sense -- show that lifting social restrictions will lead to an explosion of Covid-19 cases and cause countless more deaths. The correct way to relax restrictions is to start with parts of a state that are Covid-free for 14 days and allow only essential travel to those parts of the state with 14-day quarantines for inbound travelers. 
Why will going along with reopening lead to catastrophe? 
First, we must understand that coronavirus is very deadly. Those who claim the death rate is exaggerated are plain wrong and downplaying the emergency. While death rate estimates have varied, recent data from China, the United Kingdom and France, reflecting deaths outside hospitals, including in nursing homes, puts the Covid-19 global fatality rate at around 6.8%, based upon analysis we did at endcoronavirus.org, using data from Johns Hopkins University.
Second, almost all reopening states, from California to Pennsylvania, currently have a critical mass of new cases of existing infections that could see new outbreaks in the coming days and weeks. 
Third, without extreme preventive measures, we've seen how coronavirus infections doubled every two to three days at one point in different areas -- which equated to about a tenfold increase per week. That means that a state with 1,000 new cases could have well over 100,000 more in two weeks, if social distancing is loosened. 
States like Texas have announced precautions to mitigate harm from reopening with measures like limiting restaurants and shopping malls to operating at a 25% or 50% capacity depending on the amount of cases in their areas. But we know from months of studying this disease that communities need more aggressive measures to stop the exponential spread of Covid-19.
We prevented the contagion from being much worse by putting in place protective measures throughout the US. We expanded testing capacity. We ramped up our hospitals' capacity to care for critically ill patients. But this ""flattening the curve"" isn't enough. If we lighten up on our protective measures now, all the progress we've made will vanish, and we'll suffer an enormous setback. We need to push even harder to win.
My plea to everyone who lives in states that are reopening is simple: Recognize that your leaders have made a terrible decision. Don't be fooled that it's safe to return to work, go to the barber shop or have a sit-down meal in a restaurant. Protect yourself, your family and your community. Choosing to protect those you love is a heroic act.
Instead of venturing out for leisure or work, safely volunteer, taking all precautions if you go outside. Work with your local community organizations to ensure your neighbors have access to homemade cloth masks. Help organize transportation to testing sites for anyone who shows symptoms. Work with your community leaders to identify locations, such as hotels or dormitories, where infected individuals can isolate so they don't infect relatives and housemates. Partner with your local health authorities to organize monitoring teams to safely go door to door, identifying neighbors with symptoms who need isolation space and support. 
Instead of opening up now, local business leaders can find ways to support their communities in preventing transmission and being safe. Their actions will come around to help them when the community can open safely, soon.
I have great hope that individuals throughout our country will choose the heroic path. We can crush coronavirus. As too many government leaders fail us, I call on every American to lead the way."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)In his public career, Vice President Mike Pence has stressed the power of prayer and been a skeptic about science. 
At one point, he said that smoking doesn't kill and he refused to acknowledge the vast evidence that the planet is warming at an alarming rate that imperils us all. Now, in the age of pandemic, he is publicly running around without a face mask and insisting that it's OK for others remove theirs. In Pence's world (or maybe it's President Donald Trump's world) it seems that real Americans cough, sneeze and breathe free.
Let's be clear about the science behind the federal recommendation that everyone wear a mask in public settings, where social distancing is hard to maintain. 
It is based on simple logic. When you wear a mask, you are protecting others because you may have picked-up the Covid-19 virus without knowing it. It's better to cover-up than to potentially kill someone with germs you might spread.
Just before Pence made an appearance for a roundtable discussion with five food industry executives in Iowa on Friday, a White House staffer told the executives that they could remove their masks before Pence made an appearance if they wanted to. CNN, citing a source familiar with the situation, reported that the aide ""didn't ask and she didn't tell"" them to do so. The source also noted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines that masks are not necessary if people can maintain a distance of 6 feet. 
Although the staff member may not have forced anyone, it's safe to bet that perhaps the executives felt some pressure. First, who says no to a suggestion made by someone from the White House? Second, this is an administration that has been quite open about its disdain for medically and scientifically sound advice. Even the two execs who run meatpacking plants where hundreds of workers have been infected removed their masks. 
Prior to this Iowa trip, Pence had learned that his aide Katie Miller tested positive for the virus.
One would think that even if everyone was able to remain 6 feet apart during the roundtable discussion that everyone would just exercise a bit of extra precaution. After all, what could it hurt to wear the masks?
Rarely have so many seemingly intelligent leaders opted to abandon reason so publicly for something so deadly as the right to spread a killer germ. 
The revelation over Miller had prompted drama on the runway at Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force Two was delayed from taking off, so six people who had interacted with Miller could deplane. Everyone else stayed aboard and jetted off to Iowa where Covid-19 cases are spiking.
As they traveled in the state, Yahoo News reported that a Department of Homeland Security document revealed that 11 Secret Service agents had also tested positive (CNN has independently confirmed the news). 
As Trump confirmed, Pence had himself been in contact with Miller.
Given the fact that hardly anyone at the White House uses a mask and the close quarters in the old building, it should be assumed that lots of folks got near enough to Miller to risk becoming infected by the virus without knowing it. 
And it was with all of these variables in play that the vice president still decided to meet with executives -- who worked inside Covid-19 hotspots -- and have a staffer tell them that it was OK to remove their masks. 
Prior to his meeting with food execs, Pence met with religious leaders and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has loosened statewide restrictions on religious public gatherings as long as they ""implement reasonable public health measures under the circumstances of each gathering to ensure social distancing...(and) increased hygiene practices...,"" according to a new proclamation in Iowa's public health emergency declaration from Reynolds.
Although the governor did ""strongly encourage"" those who are more susceptible to severe and deadly outcomes of the virus to limit their activities outside of their home, the move still means that religious services, and the contagious interactions that permit, can resume. Imagine what could happen if a young and healthy member of a household that, for example, consists of a grandparent, went to a church service where members were asymptomatic and then brought the virus back home. 
But this possibility seemed not to be at the forefront of Pence's mind, as he spoke with the religious leaders.
It may have been, as Pence said, a ""burden"" for some to attend religious services online. But that he would describe this inconvenience as ""a source of heartache for people across the country"" when American families are losing loved ones to Covid-19 at a rate of more than 1,000 per day is profane. 
The Iowa trip was just another example of the vice president, ever Trump's lackey, being right in step with his boss' tone deafness on the issue. 
Consider last week's public relations stunt that had Pence delivering a few boxes of personal protective equipment -- without wearing a mask -- to a nursing home that had Covid-19 patients. 
More than one million of the citizens Pence serves have received a terrifying positive test result. Thousands more get the bad news every day. 
His own press aide, someone he knows well, is in quarantine. Why, in the face of this overwhelming and immediate danger, would he and the president persist in flaunting unsafe behavior and spreading deadly thinking across the land?
The answer is that pandemic denial has become, like climate change denial, a culture war fetish. Just like the automatic weapons brandished by some of those protesting stay-at-home orders, bare-faced public appearances tell the world that you consider the right to infect others a freedom that must not be abridged. 
One can accept that people who have lost employment and are in desperate financial straits, might be moved to extremes in their desire for a return to the pre-pandemic order. A sensible leader, especially one who might actually capture the attention of these angry people, would offer them reliable facts, send immediate and substantial financial help -- and put on a mask."

 (CNN)Go for a walk, visit any open establishment or public space, and you will note a disconcerting phenomenon: People without masks.
There is a pandemic. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of Covid-19, a disease that spreads in droplets that are expelled by infected humans, including as they talk or cough, and whether they show symptoms or not. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering in public, especially where there is a high degree of community-based transmission (that is, when the source of infection is unknown). I live in California, where nearly 60,000 people have been infected. Across the country 1.2 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, with more than 73,000 lives lost-- and projections for the future (another peak in the fall?) are really grim. 
Meanwhile, hospitals and their staff are pushed to the breaking point caring for the sick, with medical staff working weeks without days off to treat the afflicted, risking their own lives and those of their family. And yet, so many people refuse to take warnings seriously to protect themselves and others by wearing a mask in public. 
It's hard to pinpoint how many of us are clueless and careless -- maybe half of those who go outside? A third? Some other fraction? -- but it's certainly way too many. 
The lack of empathy is jarring. We need a shift. 
We need our leaders -- all of them -- to get the message out loud and clear. If you are away from the closed system of your home, the message should say, you must wear a mask. That means, too, employers mandating that workers of all kinds mask up. Do they want the disease spread to subside; do they want business and the economy to eventually come back -- or don't they?
Masks of any kind are not perfect barriers for contagion. Wearing one doesn't offer full protection and shouldn't be thought of as a foolproof, safe way to interact. But experts report that wearing a mask does help protect against transmission by asymptomatic carriers. And note that data show -- according to, among others, Robert Redfield, President Donald Trump's CDC director -- that likely one in four people infected with Covid-19 are indeed asymptomatic and unaware of their contagion. 
Be prudent, be kind. One can think the government's response to the virus is an overreaction and still wear a mask, just in case you might make someone sick. That's reality.
Wearing a mask is cumbersome. It's hot, and it's uncomfortable. But it can save lives and ease the burden on those doctors and nurses facing unspeakable pain and suffering on the front lines. 
Making personal sacrifices for the public good has not always been an American priority. We are an individualistic culture, and by nature we may find it more difficult to empathize with others when our own freedom and liberties feel like they are on the line. There is resistance to allowing the government or anyone else step in and require -- or even strongly urge -- Americans to cover their faces. 
But surely we can all understand that sometimes regulations are in place to protect people from themselves, or to avoid suffering of the community. We require drivers to wear seat belts to protect the passengers and minimize the potential for serious injury. (Those injuries not only affect the driver, but also the emergency room workers and even taxpayers through disability and unemployment.) 
Laws require children to have vaccines, not only for the child's sake but to maintain herd immunity for all of us. We don't have a vaccine for Covid-19. But we can all help until we do: we DO know about masks.
Back in the early 1990s, I was a social work intern in the HIV/AIDS unit at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. AIDS was still a death sentence, and every worker and visitor took ""universal precautions"" to avoid transmission with all patients. The prevailing wisdom then and now is that when it's impossible to assess by looking if someone could be infected, wear gloves and masks. We protected ourselves. Yes, wearing gloves was uncomfortable. So was getting HIV.
Where are our universal precautions for Covid-19?
Wearing a mask in public is an act of respect for your fellow humans. This is the kind of empathy I try to teach my children. Our kids are watching the adults through this pandemic, and they are learning lots of lessons -- intended and unintended. 
I want my children to understand that being mildly inconvenienced for the greater good is not only right, it's a moral imperative. It's how we manage to live together in relative safety in our society.
It's a no brainer. Wear the damn mask."

 (CNN)This Sunday, the Covid-19 pandemic, which already has flattened several holiday celebrations -- Mardi Gras, St Patrick's, Passover, Easter, Ramadan -- will run over another. And not just any holiday, but the one that for many, including me, is the most important of them all: Mother's Day. 
Even for ardent social distancing enthusiasts, the urge to gather, to cut a few corners, bend the rules and not the curve, to try to outsmart the current rules of engagement, will be intense. I mean, if the weather is nice, we could sit outdoors six feet apart and wave, right? And the presents, we could put them in a room for three days and... 
But let's be smart and safe about this. To help sort through what's ahead, here are a few tips to help you plan. 
Families that live far away from mothers or grandmothers are the only ones with a simple choice --call or video-chat. 
But what if you typically pack up and head over to see Mom? Or wait for Mom to visit? Or meet in a restaurant? What should you do? 
As difficult as it is, the answer is simple. Don't. 
Travel and uncertainty will make not only the day itself unsettling, but for the two weeks afterward every sneeze, every cough and every ache experienced by anyone will spark panic and regret. The visit is simply not worth the risk -- however small -- of exposing Mom to the virus that causes Covid-19. 
Besides, we were given Zoom, and a two-month lead on how to use it, precisely because we knew Mother's Day was coming, right? OK, the fun wore off quickly and we know what everyone's walls and bookshelves look like, and the discussions of walls and bookshelves already is stale.
Indeed, Zoom and its competitors have become a chore, starting with the fumbling and technical chaos at the start and ending with the realization that no one really knows when or how to leave the call without seeming rude. 
But this is for Mom. And with everyone's mom at the center of the call, the circle of Zoomers will quickly fall in line and resume where they were the last time the family gathered, with grudges, slights, misunderstandings, and -- special new feature -- private chats to complain. Introducing America's first virtual Festivus -- which will be wonderful. 
The busiest day for restaurants is not Christmas or Valentine's Day, but Mother's Day. 
By a long shot. Conviviality, though, relies on proximity, right? How do we make it festive if we are staring at 13-inch screens miles apart?
This one is easy -- order in big meals for Mom and you and your siblings and the entire extended family. Parents love to watch their children and grandchildren eat. I know this both as a former child and a current parent. The joy of watching a loved one pack down a good meal, even on video, is much better than consuming the meal oneself. Plus, food adds easy topics for consideration during the e-chat. 
This is the only truly difficult question. There will a chance to talk to Mom tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Go ahead and creep in this petty pace. She will understand.
But what about an elderly mother or grandmother living alone or in a long-term care facility? America has 1,600 nursing homes caring for 1.3 million residents and about 70% of the residents are women. This is because women live four or five years longer than men in just about every society, creating the imbalance. 
And as has been well-documented in recent weeks, nursing homes, along with prisons and meat-packing factories, currently are the hot spots of Covid-19 transmission. At least 1 in 10 nursing homes have a case (which usually means many more than one case) Recent estimates place the number of nursing home deaths from Covid-19 at 17,000, a number that is sure to rise. 
It unfortunately gets worse: When France began to include nursing home deaths in their tally, the number of fatalities doubled. In New Jersey, the governor announced recently that about half of the fatalities in the entire state were related to nursing homes, a predicament that has now made employees fear becoming ill and has prevented loved ones from being able to visit. And in the US, the enforcement of protective regulations has been loosened, not tightened, despite the tragedy.
When the story of the Covid-19 pandemic finally is written, the ongoing cruel disregard for the elderly will stand out as a shocking example of inhumanity. The federal government has made no concerted attempt to address the problem beyond guidance to sharply restrict visitors and recommend supplies that seldom are available. 
Though facilities generally do not allow visitors, a simple solution to visitor restrictions, such as establishing rapid testing stations at these facilities and supplying everyone with appropriate masks and gloves, has not even been undertaken at scale nationally.
Indeed, testing of residents and staff and reporting the results to the public, particularly to families, has been done haphazardly if at all. 
So for a Mother's Day gift this year, in addition to the scarf or picture frame or home-drawn greeting card, consider making noise. Call someone -- a President, a senator, a governor, a mayor, a hapless Cabinet member, anyone and everyone -- to deliver one loud message: The cruel and unusual punishment of the elderly, who raised us, loved us, and protected us for our entire life, simply cannot continue."

 (CNN)With Covid-19 isolating young people from their peers around the world, many observers worry about a ""lost generation"" emerging. The roster of leading American presidential candidates, dominated by aging baby boomers in 2020, offers little evidence that young voices are coming forward as a viable political force. 
Although there are many reasons to worry about the mental health and social development of young people in the shadow of Covid, we see reasons for optimism in their new burst of coherent political activism, partially facilitated by the pandemic. College students and recent graduates are well situated to organize, connect and build a new consensus on policy reforms. Young Americans, in particular, are showing commitment to a pragmatic center of policy priorities: affordable health care for all, environmental sustainability, international cooperation, civil rights and economic justice. Despite their current isolation, most young Americans embrace empathetic leadership and they are devoted to serving their communities. 
Right now, the conditions are ripe for a youth-led political movement in the United States and other countries, demanding reforms in line with their values. And as societies try to emerge from Covid-19 lockdown conditions, young voices will have an opportunity to grow in influence. Within recent days, according to Pew, millennials overtook baby boomers as America's largest generation, and Gen Z will comprise 10% of the eligible voter electorate for the 2020 US elections. Covid-19 could be the exogenous shock to our socio-political system that will realign the nation's priorities and break the polarization and anger that dominate our political lives.
Many pundits question whether young people in the US will come out to vote, when traditionally their participation numbers have been lower than older cohorts. In recent Democratic primaries their turnout was disappointing, especially for candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who relied on the enthusiasm of young voters. If young people do not vote in larger numbers, their activism -- however lively or inspiring -- has little hope of influencing policy. 
But these pessimistic judgments are also misleading. Youth turnout in recent elections shows a clear pattern of increase through the 2020 primary season. Facebook and other social media platforms are sharing information widely with young voters about why they should vote, and how they can register, despite efforts by some states to suppress their votes. Voting-by-mail will also facilitate youth turnout, as the April 7 elections in Wisconsin illustrated. Most significant, the Covid-19 crisis has provided a shared imperative for young people to elect representatives who will address their common educational, health, and employment needs. Young voters arguably have more motivation than any time since the Vietnam War. 
By helping younger Americans find their voice and show them how to matter, political loyalties can be forged for effective governance. The question now is whether either party can muster the leadership, discipline, and vision to take advantage of this opening and work with this emerging generation. Because of their numbers and their vital role in rebuilding societies after the pandemic, young men and women are perfectly suited to lead the charge forward for several reasons. 
First, young people have a history of igniting political change in times of crisis. The 1960s are the best recent example, when young men and women organized around universities to march for civil rights, withdrawal from war in Vietnam, and reform in communist tyrannies around the world. They held the hypocrisies of their elders up to a bright light and transformed every major society in the years after 1968.
Second, while the hearts and minds of many college students today are open, pragmatic and moderate, they have also long felt ignored. That must change in the Covid era. Research from the American Enterprise Institute consistently shows that most Gen Zers, for instance, feel that they have limited efficacy compared to older generations; more so than older counterparts, Gen Zers tend to feel that holding elections doesn't make the government pay attention to what the people think. In this light, the dearth of excitement for the 2020 election on campuses makes some sense.
However, AEI's research also shows that the often-claimed ideological leftism of 18 to 22 year-old Americans is overstated, and this is the case for those both in and out of college. Many more Gen Zers than stereotype might suggest identify as something other than ""liberal"" -- moderates, conservatives and even those who haven't given politics much thought are well represented. 
These findings make it quite clear that there is no left monoculture among young citizens; significant numbers cluster in the middle, are politically open and fairly disconnected, and are not on the extremes whatsoever. A new consensus is possible, especially around leaders who can reach out and respond to the pragmatic policy values of Gen Zers.
Third, and perhaps most important, technology empowers young citizens to connect and organize more rapidly and inexpensively than before. With current shutdowns of school and business, millennials and Gen Zers have an unusual but opportune moment to use this technology for their purposes. They are focused on connecting with one another and creating new economic and social opportunities.
Take two political races that are very much in the minds of our students. The 2016 victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton for the White House and the 2018 primary win of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez over Joseph Crowley, a 10-term, influential incumbent in New York's 14th Congressional district and former chair of the House Democratic Caucus. In both cases, the victorious candidates relied heavily on social media, authentic grassroots organizing and mobilization and working outside the traditional power bases of their parties. Trump's supporters were older, on average, than Ocasio-Cortez's, but they both exploited new technologies and motivations for political participation.
Campaign spending reflected the Ocasio-Cortez mantra: ""You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game."" In Ocasio-Cortez's case, she was outspent by Crowley 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000). In the case of Clinton and Trump, Secretary Clinton had a poor grassroots ground game and her campaign spent significant sums on negative television advertising.
Politics by other means, emphasizing new technology and new voters, has become the new normal. The traditional tactics of late 20th-century big money -- especially centrally controlled prime time advertising, phone banking, and postal mailings -- are less relevant.
This new campaign context opens crucial space for young voters, who are savvy enough to look beyond Twitter and its extreme echo chamber. Young Americans are quite comfortable connecting on multiple platforms, despite the superficial narratives that they are scared of intimacy and talking on the phone. In fact, younger Americans are the most communicative across an array of media. And, unlike television and print media which are very costly and territorially limited, the technologies used by young citizens are inexpensive and widely accessible. Without question, young Americans are already doing more of the talking and listening.
Steven Olikara has been organizing young people for more than a decade as the founder of the Millennial Action Project in Washington DC. He told us, ""Crises like Covid-19 demand cooperative leadership that inspires hope in our future. Millennial leaders are answering that call, utilizing technology to bring thousands of university courses online, and taking to social media to educate citizens on how to vote safely in a pandemic.""
Olikara recounted how just last week a group of young elected leaders in Iowa came together across party lines to release a series of online videos through social media, aimed at motivating fellow millennials to vote and participate in other ways. It is but one among many examples of young people around the country standing up for our democracy, and reaching out to their peers.
For young men and women, in particular, Covid-19 has laid bare the incompetence and isolation of the Trump administration. Harm and fallout from this pandemic will be felt everywhere in the nation regardless of party. The upcoming election and its aftermath could resemble 1932 -- a realigning shift. Past crises have catalyzed significant political change, and there is strong reason to expect Covid-19 to have a similar transformative effect. This is not a good time to be a Republican incumbent. 
The most important political fact of our times is that our nation's young citizens are at home in larger numbers than ever before in the last century. They are widely connected to one another, and they are looking to make their voices heard. Young Americans have sparked real change before, and they are largely empathetic and open pragmatists.

The man who said he knew more about ISIS than the generals and claimed to have stunned dumfounded aides with his scientific acuity prides himself on a mystical instinct to make right calls. 
Yet Trump's leadership in the worst domestic crisis since World War II has consistently featured wrong, ill-informed and dangerous decisions, omissions and politically fueled pivots.
""Many very good experts, very good people too, said this would never affect the United States,"" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday. ""The experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong and a lot of people didn't know it would be this serious."" 
Such comments are typical of Trump's consistent habit of blaming others for his own poor judgments. For the record, senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official Nancy Messonnier warned on February 27 that it was inevitable the disease would reach the US and could be ""bad."" 
The President's deflections on Tuesday are typical of his wider political method of evading responsibility by bending the truth and of creating distractions. They play into what is apparently his most pressing concern -- massaging his own reputation. Such tactics helped him ride out the Russia scandal and impeachment.
But in the depths of the current disorientating times, the deeper liabilities of the President's political approach are being exposed. A hostility to details, a resistance to accepting the advice of experts and for learning the messy intricacies of a crisis that interrupted his own narrative in election year. Bolstering such an impression, the Washington Post reported for instance that multiple references to the threat from the novel coronavirus were embedded into Trump's classified briefings. Either he didn't read them or he chose to ignore them.
Trump's initial failure was to downplay the seriousness of the crisis. But his management of the situation ever since then has raised questions about the extent to which the President has appreciated the multi-front challenge facing the United States and the world.
Humanity is facing three crises at the very least -- medical, economic and social -- that will cause financial and geopolitical reverberations for years. Yet Trump says he sees ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and acts as if America is nearly home free.
Doubts about the seriousness of the administration's response were also revealed in a more trivial, yet still telling, episode on Tuesday when Vice President Mike Pence flouted CDC guidance and chose not to wear a facemask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Pence explained that he is frequently tested for Covid-19 so was unlikely to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
But he missed a chance to set an example to the rest of the country.
Trump's comments contradict his own experts
Trump's comments on injecting disinfectant last week were ridiculed. But they were a sign of something more than the usual Trumpian storm. They were remarks of a President who often appears unprepared, riffs on intricate issues and hasn't done the homework to master details of a complicated emergency. 
Similarly, Trump urged governors on Monday to seriously consider reopening schools, CNN reported. But he didn't appear to have considered implications of millions of kids gathering, spreading the virus and infecting older, more vulnerable family members in a manner that could fuel the pandemic. His comment was consistent with an apparent conclusion that the worst of the pandemic has passed and that the virus, which scientists say is lying in wait for reopening, is simply gone. 
Even if the looming clutch of state openings do not cause a second spike in the virus, public health experts fear that in the absence of a vaccine it will return with a vengeance later in the year. Not Trump.
""I think what happens is it's going to go away. This is going to go away. And whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we'll be able to handle it,"" he said in remarks that may again amount to underestimating a potential threat.
One of Trump's top medical experts, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been far less enthusiastic than Trump about the lackluster US testing effort appears far less optimistic.
""If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well. If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter,"" Fauci said on Tuesday during an Economic Club of Washington webinar. 
The President is again pushing aggressively for states to get back to business quickly -- despite balking at Georgia's aggressive plan last week. 
""Many States moving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday, showing little appreciation of the huge gamble with health and lives governors are taking without the safety net of a blanket testing program Trump has declined to provide.
The terrible choice facing political leaders 
A wrenching national conversation is needed, ideally led by the President, about the relative impact of the pandemic and the job destroying lockdowns ordered to stop its spread. Political leaders must consider what level of infection and ultimately death is acceptable in a modern society in order to protect basic levels of economic viability. These are crushingly difficult issues that no official expected to face when they ran for office.
But there is no sign that Trump is about to engage on that issue with the public whose confidence will be needed to make any economic rebound sustainable. Every world and local leader is facing these agonizing choices. But given US power, influence and historic leadership of the Western world, a special burden of responsibility is often seen to rest on the shoulders of the man in the Oval Office.
Any normal President who made a prediction that a miracle would sweep a pandemic away, only to see it infect a million Americans over a couple of months, would be politically shattered. President George W. Bush's failures over Hurricane Katrina look trivial by comparison. Yet Trump is protected in his bubble of unknowingness by a conservative media machine that attacks anyone who contradicts his comments. 
The administration's questionable commitment to addressing the nuts and bolts of the emergency have been evident in its repeated promises and failures to scale up the kind of massive testing effort that could help pry open the economy without the risk of a major resurgence. 
Trump appears to have convinced himself that the lack of tests that his own experts and governors say are needed to trace and isolate new infections to stop a resurgence are mere distractions.
""There are big believers in testing, and then there are some governors that don't feel as strongly about it at all,"" Trump, said Monday. 
Such comments make it seem unlikely the President has read the multiple think tank studies or expert opinions that millions of tests per day are needed to beat the pandemic or is interested in guidance that contradicts his pre-cooked view of the pandemic being close to its end. 
Trump prefers to boast about the true fact that the US has tested more people than any other nation. But his sincerity is undermined by the reality that other smaller countries have tested far more people per capita. The US has tested 16.4 tests per 1,000 people, according to the a new Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development report, below the OECD member average of 23.1 tests per 1,000 people and trails Spain and Italy. America does, however, lead the UK and France.
The President's forecasts for the economy also don't seem to appreciate the depth of the slide. His predictions of ""spectacular"" growth in the next few quarters and an economy that will take off like a ""rocket"" sit uneasily with warnings by a top adviser, Kevin Hassett, that the country could be heading for Great Depression levels of unemployment.
There is also debate about the President's observance of another aspect of his role as head of state -- his willingness to console the country at a time of mourning. Trump usually mentions those who died and says they will not be forgotten during his scripted remarks at the start of press conferences. But he most often talks about the dead in terms of what he says are lower than projected final death toll models after the pandemic. And he has taken to arguing that his efforts -- which were belated -- might have saved a million lives. 
There are no guarantees another president of either party would have done a better job in this time of testing than the unconventional Trump.
But it's almost certain that he or she would have made a far greater show of mastering the details and would -- even for their own political protection if nothing else -- have done far more to prepare the country for the trial ahead."

Google Meet, Google's newest video chat service, will soon be free for everyone. The service, which was previously locked behind G Suite, is opening up to anyone with a Google account.
Users will be able to access the service at meet.google.com or through the iOS and Android apps. While the service is free now, it won't be free forever. Google says that, after September 30, meetings will be limited to 60 minutes.
If you've never heard of ""Google Meet"" before, don't feel bad. The branding only popped up earlier this month, when Google quietly renamed ""Google Hangouts Meet"" to ""Google Meet."" Hangouts Meet is something we've written about before, and it launched in 2017 as a reboot to Google's enterprise messaging suite, which consisted of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Both of these 2017 enterprise ""Hangouts"" products have no relation to the widely-used consumer-focused ""Google Hangouts"" chat app from 2013, which is still part of Gmail and was a default Android app for a long time. Google claims it wants to merge all the ""Hangouts"" products together, but you can never be sure what the future of Google's disorganized messaging strategy will hold.Just like with its instant messaging strategy over the years, Google has really dropped the ball when it comes to video conferencing apps. Google's first efforts in video chat started with a Gmail video chat in 2008 and peaked with Google Hangouts video chat in 2013. Google has been in video chat for longer than most of its contemporary competition (other than Skype), but a lack of focus and a continual need to shut down one product and then launch a similar product under a different name left the company spinning its wheels for years. If Google could focus and put the company's massive resources behind a single communication suite that is continually updated and maintained, it could have been an industry leader by now. Instead, Google Meet will be Google's third video chat service in the market, after Google Hangouts and Google Duo.
Employees inside the company are apparently frustrated with Google's market position, too. A recent article from The New York Times details how tech giants like Google and Facebook are chasing Zoom, and it ends with a great anecdote:
Late last month, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, held a videoconference with thousands of the search giant's employees using Google Meet, three people who attended the call said. During the session, one employee asked why Zoom was reaping the biggest benefits even though Google had long offered Meet.
Mr. Schindler tried placating the engineer's concerns, the people said. Then his young son stumbled into view of the camera and asked if his father was talking to his co-workers on Zoom. Mr. Schindler tried correcting him, but the boy went on to say how much he and his friends loved using Zoom.
COVID-19's shelter-in-place requirements made millions people turn to working from home. That led to a huge spike in video chat users, but this general availability of Google Meet already seems like it was too late to ride this wave of users. The work-from-home trend started two months ago when Google Meet was still locked behind the GSuite paywall. Zoom was ready and burst into the public consciousness as a result. By now, it seems like most of the people who were going to transition to a video chat app have already done so, and they picked Zoom.
Google doesn't have a strong argument for why someone would switch from Zoom, either. Google alludes to better security in its blog post, but neither Zoom nor Google Meet is end-to-end encrypted. Both are only ""encrypted in transit,"" which anyone who uses an HTTPS connection can claim. Your conversation might be private from the wider Internet, but it's possible that the service provider can view your meeting data. Participating in a meeting also requires a Google account, while Zoom makes it possible to join a meeting without any account at all. Zoom can secure a meeting with only a password, giving it a much lower barrier to entry.
Like most Google launches, not everyone will get access to Google Meet immediately. Google says that availability for Google Meet will slowly roll out to users ""over the following weeks."""

But some experts say asymptomatic infections are common, presenting a huge challenge in the control of the disease. 
WHAT IS ASYMPTOMATIC AND PRE-SYMPTOMATIC? 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines here asymptomatic cases as those who don't show symptoms but have been confirmed infected through a lab test. WHO notes there are few reports of truly asymptomatic cases. 
The incubation period, or the time a person takes to show symptoms after getting infected, is the pre-symptomatic phase, the WHO says. Carriers can infect others during this period. 
Health experts are not yet sure whether asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases are infectious. Some say data so far suggests those cases are probably equally likely to be able to spread infection. 
The WHO agrees that pre-symptomatic carriers are infectious, and adds that there is also a possibility - although little evidence so far - that people who are asymptomatic may also transmit the virus. The WHO had said in early April that there had been no documented asymptomatic transmissions. 
WHAT ELSE DOES CHINA SAY? 
China has reported around 83,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It does not include asymptomatic cases in that total official count, but began reporting them separately on a daily basis on March 31. 
That has raised concerns about Beijing’s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also paint a misleading picture of how the virus spreads. 
“If you watch (such asymptomatic cases) really closely, you would see something ... that probably fits with a more realistic mild disease than a complete asymptomatic,” Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland said. 
“But the term is around now and it’s going to stick. It’s a nice piece of theatre, but I don’t think it’s going to give useful information.” 
Asymptomatic cases under medical observation in China dropped to 357 as of Tuesday from 1,541 as of March 30. 
Wuhan has tested almost its entire population of 11 million and found no new COVID-19 cases. 
Wuhan’s low rate of symptomless carriers is in line with China’s previous reporting, said Zhong Nanshan, the government’s senior medical adviser, adding that the result showed that the country didn’t cover up the epidemic as some U.S. politicians claimed. 
HOW ABOUT REST OF ASIA? 
Some countries in Asia include asymptomatic carriers in their total confirmed cases. 
In Vietnam, which has just over 300 COVID-19 cases, almost 37% were symptomless, according to health ministry data. 
Researchers concluded that asymptomatic infection was common and found two asymptomatic patients had infected at least four other people. 
South Korea, which had early success in taming the outbreak through aggressive testing, said 20%-30% were asymptomatic. A senior health official said the virus could be widely transmitted during the incubation period, but asymptomatic patients were less likely to transmit it. 
Singapore, which has the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia, does not give data on asymptomatic cases but has said an overwhelming majority of positive cases in its crowded migrant workers’ dormitories show mild or no symptoms. 
The Philippines said about 13% of its nearly 19,000 cases were asymptomatic. In India, some 28% of 40,184 people who tested positive between Jan. 22 and April 30 were asymptomatic, according to a study.

FIFA’s plan means world soccer’s governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits. 
FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its ‘Forward’ projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women’s football. 
The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a ‘universal solidarity grant’ of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women’s football. 
Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million. 
FA’s will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million. 
“Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions. 
Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds. 
The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations’ desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches. 
Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America. 
The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a ‘test event’ for the 2022 World Cup. 
The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only. 
The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar’s World Cup organising committee.

In an Instagram post, Robin Duran wrote that his 69-year-old father recently tested positive after originally believing that he had merely the common cold. 
The younger Duran added, as translated from Spanish, “He is not in intensive care or on a ventilator, he is still under observation. We just talked to the doctor and he tells us that the lungs are fine and there is no indication of seriousness. Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well. I’ll keep you informed. Regards!” 
Duran, a Panamanian nicknamed “Manos de Piedra” (Hands of Stone), earned championships in the lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight divisions while compiling a 103-16 record with 70 knockouts. He is widely viewed as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of all time, and the Associated Press ranked him the best lightweight of the 20th century. 
He might be best remembered for a pair of fights against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980. Duran won the world welterweight championship by earning a unanimous-decision victory over Leonard at Montreal in June. Five months later, Leonard won back his title with an eighth-round technical knockout in New Orleans, when Duran was heard by the referee to say “No mas” (“No more”). 
The result ended Duran’s 41-match winning streak. 
In 1989, Leonard beat Duran by unanimous decision at Las Vegas to win the WBC super middleweight championship. 
Duran began his boxing career in 1968 at age 16, and he kept fighting until he was 50 years old, when he lost a unanimous decision to Hector Camacho in 2001. 
He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007."

The case also provides an insider account of the dysfunction critics say paralyzed the Department of Health and Human Services at the dawn of the COVID-19 response. 
The complaint by Dr. Rick Bright, who headed a federal agency called the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, until April 20, says HHS Secretary Alex Azar and his top aides dismissed experts’ warnings about the impending epidemic, failed to implement vital procedures and got sidetracked with political backbiting. 
Bright’s complaint, filed Tuesday, was the subject of media reports for its description of the administration’s scramble to make malaria drugs available at President Trump’s behest. However, the complaint also offers fresh details that haven’t been highlighted. They show how tensions between public health agencies likely delayed a more aggressive early government response. 
When Bright pushed top management in late January to move aggressively, the complaint said, HHS leaders “responded with surprise at Dr. Bright’s dire predictions and urgency, and asserted that the United States would be able to contain the virus and keep it out of the United States.” 
As Reuters reported last month, Azar in January tapped a 37-year-old political appointee with minimal public health or administrative experience to coordinate the agency’s day-to-day response to COVID-19. For six years before joining the Trump Administration, the aide, Brian Harrison, had been a professional labradoodle breeder. 
To read the earlier Reuters report, click reut.rs/2VtT2aA
The whistleblower complaint asserts Harrison and Deputy Chief of Staff Judy Stecker blocked Bright, the government’s top vaccine expert, from key HHS meetings in January. “The decision to eliminate BARDA was made by Brian Harrison, Secretary Azar’s Chief of Staff, and Ms. Stecker,” the complaint said. 
BARDA and Stecker referred calls to HHS, which declined comment. Bright, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. The HHS declined to arrange interviews with Azar and Harrison. 
In an email to a colleague in January, Bright wondered why his group was left out but noted that other health agencies were involved, so his was an “obvious group to cut if shrinking the table. But we have a significant role.” 
In his whistleblower complaint, he said it became clear to him why he was pushed aside. “It was obvious that Dr. Bright’s persistent demands for urgent action to respond to the pandemic had caused a ‘shit storm’ and a ‘commotion’ and were unwelcome in the office of the HHS Secretary,” he wrote. “As a result, HHS leadership excluded Dr. Bright and BARDA from these recurring meetings and from the critical discussions about addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
As Reuters earlier reported, three government sources said Harrison had also blocked the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Stephen Hahn, from a White House task force set up in January to address the public health crisis. 
Three sources say Harrison, who held previous government posts before owning the dog breeding business, kept a “white noise” machine outside his office door to prevent others from hearing his conversations. The agency earlier told Reuters the device was installed by the HHS Office of National Security. HHS also said Harrison was not the person who initially excluded the FDA commissioner, without saying who did. 
Azar earlier told Reuters Harrison has a “deep appreciation for HHS’s complex work.” Others say a chief of staff does not necessarily need healthcare expertise. “There are two important things about chiefs of staff,” said former HHS official William Pierce. “One, you trust them and, two, they make the trains run on time.” 
DELAYED DISASTER PLAN 
In his complaint, Bright also asserts the federal government didn’t initiate a key disaster procedure until the fourth week of January. The Disaster Leadership Group brought together management of key agencies. When he suggested implementing the group earlier, on January 18, Bright said his supervisor, Robert Kadlec, first said it wasn’t necessary and then that there wasn’t “urgency.” Kadlec referred questions to the HHS, which declined comment. 
The complaint also recounts a frustrating attempt to get samples of the actual virus from China, which Bright says “were critical to begin development of vaccines, diagnostics, and medicines.” He said he pushed HHS officials on January 10, 21 and 23 “to obtain sequencing and virus samples from China, to no avail.” On January 27, as Azar was scheduled to talk with China’s health minister, Bright unsuccessfully pressed again. 
The complaint said his team “feverishly emailed health officials and laboratories in Australia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and France to try to obtain samples because the CDC had refused to provide information or virus samples to them.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred questions to HHS, which had no comment. 
Bright, whose lawyers filed the complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is expected to testify about his allegations next week to Congress.

Djokovic, Coric, Grigor Dimitrov and Viktor Troicki all tested positive for COVID-19 after playing in the event in Serbia and Croatia, which drew big crowds and saw the players pose for pictures together. 
World No. 1 Djokovic, who organised the charity event, has come in for heavy criticism after the players were pictured hugging at the net, playing basketball and partying together. 
“A few days have passed since I tested positive for Covid-19,” world number 33 Coric said on Twitter, with a picture of him standing on a treadmill. 
“I’m extremely grateful that I still feel well and don’t have any symptoms ... TY very much for all the messages of love and support I have received whilst isolating.” 
Djokovic has apologised and said the timing of the event was “too soon” while world number three Dominic Thiem, who played in the Belgrade leg, said players behaved “too euphorically”. 
Djokovic’s compatriot, Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic, came to his defence, saying there has been a “campaign” against him despite the event breaking no local rules. 
In an open letter published by Serbian media, Matic said the “mice” had came out of their holes to criticise Djokovic. 
“Very soon the cat will be on the court, and the mice back in the hole,” he wrote. “The only thing I hold against Novak is that he apologised to the mice who criticise him for no reason. 
“No, Nole. They will apologise to you - soon.”

Two had not been seen for some time, she said, adding that this is a fairly typical ratio these days for her lockdown sessions for 12 to 16-year-olds. 
Some of those who had made it to that pastoral meeting of El Espinillo secondary school in Madrid kept their webcams disabled. They were in no rush to answer when she asked how they were doing. 
“Don’t just say ‘good,’” she coaxed the screen of 13-year-olds. “Use another word.” Eventually, more considered responses trickled through her speaker: Tired. Bored. Haven’t left home for exercise. Prefer to stay indoors. 
“The charm of being in a class has been lost,” Mijares said. 
In recent months it’s a scene played out in homes worldwide, as United Nations data suggests over 1.5 billion children were affected by school closures to curb the spread of COVID-19. From Shanghai to California, students have been kept out of classrooms, and attendance at online sessions has thinned. 
But as the school year comes to an end and countries count the cost of the lost learning, Spanish government data points to a particularly damaging consequence of the isolation caused by the pandemic: The disenfranchisement of ever more young people, particularly those on low incomes, such as the children of those who are caring for the vulnerable. 
Spain has had more than 260,000 cases of COVID-19 according to a Reuters tally - the second-highest total in Europe after the United Kingdom. But unlike other countries including Britain, in Spain all schools closed during lockdown. There was no skeleton service for children of key personnel like health workers. 
Since March, all educational centres including primary, secondary and universities have been closed, leaving 9.5 million students learning from home. Most schools will not open for all pupils until the new academic year starts in September. 
In Spain, school drop-out rates were already the highest in the European Union - 17.3% in 2019. Now, the government estimates up to 12% of school children have dropped out of distance-learning during the 14-week lockdown - nearly one million pupils. 
Mijares’ school serves a working-class district - pupils range from white-collar households to families on state aid, says headmistress Toni Garcia. As the lockdown dragged on, Mijares realised she would have to find different ways to reach students, including making landline calls to them. 
“I spoke to families who said they were overwhelmed by all the assignments and all the emails,” she said, sitting in her brother’s old bedroom which she has converted into her office since moving back in with her parents during lockdown. 
“One of my tasks has been to call and explain how to read and send an email from a mobile phone.” 
In lockdown, limited access to the internet creates a social barrier. According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 2015, more than 90% of disadvantaged students in countries such as Canada, Korea and Australia had internet access. But disadvantaged students in Spain were nearly 14% less likely than rich ones to get online. That gap was even wider in the United States and Russia, where fewer than one in five disadvantaged students had internet access. 
Spain’s low-income learners are already faring worse than many in Europe. The financial crisis of 2008-2014 laid off over 2 million workers and even today, despite years of strong economic growth, the country has the EU’s second-highest unemployment rate after Greece. There are 2.2 million children at risk of poverty and exclusion in Spain - over a quarter of the total child population, according to calculations by humanitarian group Save the Children. 
The income difference between the richest fifth of Spain’s population and the poorest - a measure of inequality - is among the highest in Europe and has grown over the last decade, according to the European Anti-Poverty Network. The widening gulf poses crucial questions for economic growth and social stability. 
“It’s the most worrying fact about Spain - the very high percentage of (early school) leavers,” Olivier De Schutter, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told Reuters. 
“The role the school should normally play - as a force for social mobility and a way to equalise chances in life - is much more difficult to play if you close down the school,” he said. Continued disruption may increase the gap, he said. 
The government said physical presence in classrooms will be the general standard when schools reopen. It is keen for all children to be able to return to the classroom because of the role schools play in eliminating inequality, said education ministry spokeswoman Mar Hedo. 
“EVERYTHING IS WEIGHING ON ME” 
The school closures have left many struggling. Single mother Saida Juarez, 50, works as a care home assistant in Vallecas, a suburb of Madrid. When the pandemic struck, she isolated herself from her two sons within her flat to cut the risk of infecting them. 
For 10 weeks, she had no physical contact with either of the boys, who are 16 and 10. 
The children have work sent to them by email which they receive by mobile phone. When they’ve finished, they take photos which they send back for marking. Juarez has not been able to help them with their schoolwork. 
“I couldn’t go near them,” she said, speaking in the living room of her flat. 
Her eldest son Gabriel, who attends a different school than the one Mijares teaches at, enters his final year of compulsory education next year and hopes eventually to join the police. Since lockdown he has been looking after his younger brother, Matias, while his mother works from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
At first when Juarez came home, she would shower, douse herself in liquid sanitiser and go to the kitchen to prepare meals for the boys, she said. She spent the rest of the evening in her room, communicating with them by phone. 
“I was scared that I was bringing the virus home,” she said. “It was so hard and painful not to have contact.” 
Later that month, she fell ill herself, was bed-ridden for 10 days and stayed off work for around a month, self-isolating in her bedroom. The health service asked her to stay at home and checked her regularly by phone. Weeks later, she was tested for COVID-19 and the result came back negative. 
Gabriel did the shopping and cooking during that time and helped Matias with his schoolwork, as well as doing his own. He misses school, he said, because it’s harder to ask teachers for help. He emailed his teachers, but their answers came more slowly than they would in class. 
There are times, Gabriel said, when he gets up and has to make breakfast, put the house in order, take their pet dog out and only then get to his school work. “I get up tired and it’s like everything is weighing on me,” he said, sitting with his brother and friends in masks at the dining room table where he studies. 
When Spaniards were first allowed out of their houses for exercise in early May, Gabriel said he met a friend who came to help him with his studies. But after so long without contact, he didn’t know what to say or how to act. 
“It’s going to be hard to go back to interacting with people because I’ve been so long without speaking to anyone.” 
“HOW DOES THIS WORK?” 
According to government statistics, public investment in education in Spain has fallen since 2009 to 4.23% of GDP in 2018 - a cut of around 3 billion euros. Since schools shut down, the fact that the most vulnerable families do not have computing resources has added to the difficulty. 
In a child support centre in Madrid in mid-May, care assistant Turia was one of those who came to collect a tablet - one of 1,000 such devices donated in a Madrid council scheme. 
Turia, who declined to give her second name, said she works from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. as an assistant to an elderly person with Alzheimer’s and helps her two children with their school work when she gets home. She photographs the completed work and sends it back to the teachers. 
There are over 1 million children in school in Madrid, where the severe poverty rate had more than doubled in a decade to 7.8 percent in 2017, according to a U.N. report from February. The minimum salary in Spain is 950 euros per month, but social security benefits, administered regionally, are around half that. 
Madrid’s scheme provides just 400 euros a month for a single person, the lowest in the country, government figures show. At the same time Spain is one of the most expensive countries in Europe for fixed broadband, according to a 2020 study by the European Commission. 
The education ministry said it is giving more equipment to schools and working to train teachers, students and their families how to use them. But that does not help with internet access charges, and many poorer households are far behind on technical know-how, teachers say and studies show. 
About a half-dozen families came to Madrid’s child support centre that day to pick up tablets. Most said they had only a cellphone and many were not confident about using the technology. 
As Turia took the computer from the worker distributing the tablets, she asked: “How does this work?”

Some 540,000 bikes have been sold nationwide since shops across the country reopened in early May, according to sector lobby Ancma, a 60% increase in the first month compared to the same period in 2019. 
To keep people off metros and buses and avoid road congestion, the government has offered to contribute up to 500 euros ($562.70) for city-dwellers who buy traditional or “pedal-assisted” electrical bicycles. 
The subsidy, which kicked in on May 4 and runs to the end of the year, has accelerated a trend in place even in small centres where it is not available. 
“May has been an extraordinary month for the e-bike market,” Gian Franco Nanni, chief executive of Italian electric vehicle producer Askoll EVA told Reuters. “We have seen triple-digit growth in orders compared with a year ago.” 
With more than 34,600 deaths, Italy has the world’s fourth highest COVID-19 toll and authorities have warned the risk of infection is still high in crowded places. 
The government has set aside 120 million euros for its incentive plan, and has said it will make more funds available if needed. 
Bicycle use has been traditionally popular in the flat northern cities of the Po Valley such as Bologna and Parma, but is now also becoming more frequent in cities further south. 
“We have sold more than 50 bikes since we reopened,” said Simone Lazzaretti, who runs the “Lazzaretti” bike shop in the hilly capital Rome, where bicycles had never really caught on as a means to get around town. 
“We’ve sold out of all the less expensive pedal-assisted models and only have top-of-the-range ones left, which cost around 2,500 euros,” he said.

The Minerva Oceania was being held at the port’s Leopold dock after 15 of its 26-person crew had returned positive tests, a port spokeswoman said in an emailed response. 
Two of the crew members who tested positive were in hospital but their condition was not serious, she said. 
The other crew were remaining on board and those with COVID-19 self-isolating in separate cabins.

Belgian media previously reported that another ship had been quarantined at the port in April, after an outbreak of the virus among its crew. 
Belgium’s Zeebrugge port also held an Italian cruise ship for a few hours in March, when two of the more than 3,000 people on board were quarantined after contact with an infected person in Germany.

The vaccine, originally known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, was originally developed by scientists at the University of Oxford, and they are now working with AstraZeneca on development and production. 
It is already in human trials, with preliminary trials on pigs and monkeys showing some encouraging signs for the experimental vaccine, which is also known as AZD1222, in giving protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
William, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson and second-in-line to the throne, met researchers working for the Oxford Vaccine Group, including the vaccine’s developer Sarah Gilbert and the leader of the clinical trial team Andrew Pollard. 
He also spoke to AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, and officials from Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and international vaccine alliance Gavi via a video call. 
AstraZeneca has signed deals with Britain, the United States and European countries to supply the vaccine. 
Soriot has said that trial clinical results are expected in August or September, with deliveries possible from October, adding that he expects the vaccine, if it works, to protect against COVID-19 for about a year.

FIFA’s plan means world soccer’s governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits. 
FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its ‘Forward’ projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women’s football. 
The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a ‘universal solidarity grant’ of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women’s football. 
Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million. 
FA’s will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million. 
“Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions. 
Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds. 
The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations’ desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches. 
Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America. 
The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a ‘test event’ for the 2022 World Cup. 
The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only. 
The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar’s World Cup organising committee.

Remdesivir is indicated for moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 for patients in intensive care who require oxygen, while Favipiravir is indicated for mild to moderate cases. 
Eva Pharma, a generic drugmaker established in 1997, said earlier this month it had received a licence from Gilead Sciences Inc to make Remdesivir in Egypt and distribute it in 127 countries. 
It will initially make 500,000 doses a month to be sold locally for less than 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($124.07) each, said general manager Amgad Talaat, adding that they had already started delivering the medicine to quarantine hospitals. 
It has also started producing 1 million Favipiravir tablets a month, which will be on the market within two to three weeks, Talaat said. The price has still to be finalised. 
Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp, which makes Favipiravir under the brand name Avigan, said this month its research on the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment may need to continue until July. 
Eva Pharma said it had received permission from Egypt’s pharmaceutical regulatory authority to produce the drugs, and the body would decided whether they could be sold in pharmacies or only used in hospitals. 
Talaat said that once Egyptian needs were met, Eva Pharma hoped to sell any excess doses to other Middle Eastern and African countries. 
Egypt’s Rameda Pharmaceutical also said this month it had begun making Favipiravir under the brand name Anviziram and had approval to manufacture Remedsivir. ($1 = 16.1200 Egyptian pounds) (Reporting by Ehab Farouk; Writing by Patrick Werr; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)"

The New York Road Runners (NYRR), in partnership with the mayor’s office, said the decision to cancel the world’s largest marathon was made due to novel coronavirus-related health and safety concerns for runners, spectators, volunteers and staff. 
“Canceling this year’s TCS New York City Marathon is incredibly disappointing for everyone involved, but it was clearly the course we needed to follow from a health and safety perspective,” NYRR Chief Executive Michael Capiraso said in a statement. 
The 26.2-mile race (42km), which traverses all five boroughs of the city and had 53,640 finishers in 2019, is the second of the six World Marathon Majors to be cancelled this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.

GRAPHIC: COVID-19 will tilt global aluminium axis further towards China - here
CHINA - RAMPING UP AGAIN 
Chinese aluminium production fell last year for the first time in a decade. That was largely the result of unplanned outages at a couple of the country’s biggest producers and the analysts’ consensus was always for a renewed growth spurt this year. 
Annualised monthly production rates jumped the 36-million level at the start of 2020 and have remained above it ever since. 
There was a small dip in run-rates in March at the peak of China’s lockdowns, which coincided with a price trough on the Shanghai Futures Exchange aluminium contract. 
But cumulative production was still up by 2% in January-May after a 1.0% contraction last year. 
Shanghai prices have rebounded from their March slump, easing some of the previous financial stress on the country’s operators. 
New smelters, meanwhile, continue to come online. Yunnan Aluminium announced last month the commissioning of a 500,000-tonne per year plant in the Wenshan region of the province. 
Wenshan is an emerging Chinese production hub as producers migrate from older coal-powered smelters in other parts of the country towards Yunnan’s cleaner hydro power. 
In principle, such new capacity has to be matched by the closure of older capacity but the process inevitably involves capacity creep because the new smelters are more efficient than those they are replacing. 
In practice, it’s not always clear whether the older capacity was even operating. 
Either way, almost half way through 2020 and Chinese aluminium production is clearly growing again. 
Moreover, Beijing’s mandated cap on national capacity at 45 million tonnes allows plenty of leeway for further upwards creep. 
COVID-19 RECOVERY BUT PRICE PAIN GROWS 
As with their Chinese counterparts, most Western smelter operations have not been directly affected by COVID-19. 
The notable exception was Argentinian producer Aluar, which temporarily shuttered half of its 460,000-tonne per year capacity during the country’s lockdown. 
The country’s aluminium production was down an average 17% over the January-May period with Aluar operating at 54% of capacity in May, local consultancy Economic Trends found. 
The heavier toll from COVID-19 has been on demand and price. London Metal Exchange (LME) inventories have been rising steeply as unsold metal spills from the physical to the paper market, where it can be financed. 
The LME price is trading around $1,590 per tonne and struggling to stage any significant recovery from last month’s four-year low of $1,460. 
The resulting squeeze on smelter margins is starting to take a toll. 
Alcoa has announced the permanent closure of its Ferndale smelter in the U.S. state of Washington. The plant was already operating at reduced capacity of 230,000 tonnes. 
The U.S. producer has also initiated talks with unions at its similar-sized San Ciprian smelter in Spain over a possible closure decision. 
Rio Tinto has two smelters, one in Iceland and one in New Zealand, under strategic review. 
True, there are expansions under way elsewhere. 
Gulf production is booming, up 13% last year and a further 6% in January-May this year as Aluminium Bahrain ramps up its new 540,000-tonne per year Potline 6 expansion. 
Malaysia’s Press Metal is also aiming to lift capacity from 760,000 tonnes per year to 1,080,000 through its Phase 3 smelter due for commissioning at the start of next year. 
But by that time at least one more non-Chinese smelter is likely to have bitten the dust. 
The financial crisis a decade ago took out a swath of Western aluminium smelters with China’s share of global production rising to 49% at the end of 2012 from 29% at the start of 2009. 
COVID-19 is generating the same bearish mix of weak demand, surplus metal, low prices and Chinese production exuberance. 
POLITICAL DISUNITY 
As China’s smelter capacity has grown so too have its exports of semi-manufactured products. 
Semis shipments have slowed this year to the tune of 10% as overseas demand collapsed but at 1.5 million tonnes, the cumulative total is still a lot of aluminium, particularly in the current demand environment. 
China’s exports have long generated international push-back, often in the form of punitive duties. 
There had been building momentum towards a multilateral forum to engage directly with Beijing over its continued build-out of aluminium capacity. 
Unfortunately, President Trump doesn’t do multilateral forums. He chose instead to impose a blanket tariff of 10% on all U.S. imports with exceptions for a couple of close allies 
Canada was exempted last year but is faces renewed tariffs after an alleged surge of metal entering the U.S. market. 
Such national friction means there is no international political check on China’s continuing creep towards that elevated 45-million tonne capacity threshold. 
In its absence, there is no reason for China not to continue what it is doing, which is to produce more aluminium.

Nascimento lives at a “quilombo”, a settlement once set up by runaway slaves that is now inhabited by Brazilians of African heritage who maintain traditions stemming from their roots. 
While there is an official tally on the number of fatalities among indigenous people in Brazil, the government has not set up a system to register the deaths of “quilombolas”, the estimated 16 million people living in 5,000 quilombos nationwide. 
A bill passed last week by Brazil’s Congress would require the government to record these deaths, while also granting special support to quilombolas, but it is waiting the signature of President Jair Bolsonaro to become law. 
Facing government inaction, local leaders have stepped up, while opposition lawmakers have underlined the symbolic importance of this bill amid global protests over racism. 
“It’s a work to ease the pain of those who lost a relative,” Nascimento told Thomson Reuters Foundation over the phone from Quilombo Africa, in the northern state of Para, where he lives. 
Brazil has the world’s second-highest COVID-19 death toll, with more than 52,000 fatalities, 1.15 million confirmed cases, and one of the highest daily rates of new infections. 
Quilombolas chosen by CONAQ, the National Coordination of Articulation of Black Rural Quilombola Communities which is an association of quilombola communities, are tallying victims. 
So far they have logged about 84 deaths and more than 700 confirmed cases, but fear the numbers could be much higher due to low levels of testing on quilombolas, many of whom live in remote and rural areas far from the nearest hospital. 
This has made gathering data in these communities a slow and painstaking process, said Nascimento, a trained nurse. 
Nascimento is counting deaths in the northern region of Brazil where the virus first spread among quilombolas. In his home state of Para there has been 29 deaths. 
“It is a very big challenge to deal with this information. Local leaders call me on my personal phone, so when a call comes, I already answer in desperation,” he said. 
A HIDDEN PEOPLE 
When Brazil abolished slavery in 1888 - the last place in the Americas to end slavery - at least 4 million slaves had been brought into the country from Africa to work on sugar plantations and in other sectors of the flourishing economy. 
Most of their descendants in quilombos are still living below the poverty line. 
Estimates vary but government data suggests only around 250 of quilombo settlements have title deeds to their land, and without land titles, the quilombolas do not have access to social benefits, such as subsidized housing. 
Many quilombos have no electricity or running water, and live on subsistence farming, handicrafts, or from tourism. 
But as a vulnerable group, quilombolas are frequently overlooked as Brazil’s indigenous populations tend to draw more attention from rights groups, experts said. 
“It’s a universe that we have not yet managed to give due visibility to, that has a gigantic cultural wealth,” said Milene Maia, an advisor for Instituto Socioambiental, a non-profit that partnered with CONAQ to report the deaths. 
Experts are unsure if the bill now before Bolsonaro would be effective if signed into law as states already struggle to record even basic data like a patient’s race. 
A joint report by Brazil’s biggest media companies - O Globo, Extra, Estado de Sao Paulo, Folha de Sao Paulo, Uol and G1 - found that less than half of the country’s 26 states record the race of those infected by coronavirus, making the impact of the disease on minority groups difficult to ascertain. 
“The invisibility of Black people is great, but (the invisibility) of the quilombolas is even greater,” said Maia. 
A LOST CULTURE 
The bill would also provide special assistance to indigenous and quilombola groups who are more vulnerable than others to the virus, said congressman Bira do Pindare of the opposition Social Party of Brazil, who supports the bill. 
“Civil society organizations have been monitoring this and we are realizing that the lethality rate (for quilombolas) is four times higher than the rate for the general population,” said Pindare, who presides over a parliamentary group set up to protect quilombola communities. 
“In the face of worldwide mobilization against racism, this bill has an important symbolic meaning,” said Pindare. 
Nascimento said the elders were being the hardest hit by the disease and their loss taking away part of the local culture. 
“When an elderly leaves ... they carry with them a legacy of knowledge and experience,” said Nascimento. “We are losing much of our culture.” 
Rejane Oliveira misses the confident smile of Tia Uia, her aunt who died from COVID-19 this month in Rio de Janeiro state. 
Tia Uia, 78, was the granddaughter of a slave and one of the country’s most respected quilombola leaders. 
“I lost my aunt, other lost their parents and friends,” said Oliveira. “She wouldn’t want us to stop. We move on, carrying the memory of this great woman.” (Reporting by Fabio Teixeira @ffctt; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.

As cases of the new coronavirus climb and Kenyans are told to stay home and avoid human contact, 38-year-old Omondi moves house to house through Kawangware’s maze of narrow lanes. 
Standing at the doorways of the cramped, corrugated houses, she talks about COVID-19, shows residents how to wash hands or don a mask, patiently answering their questions. 
“I know there are risks of contracting the virus, but I don’t feel so scared. I have made a pledge to keep my community safe,” said Omondi, turning to reprimand a group of children crowded around her for not maintaining social distancing rules. 
“You see how small and close together the places where we live are. We have to make sure people understand how they can stop corona from spreading. Here, if one person gets it, everyone can.” 
The mother of three is not a doctor, nurse or medic of any sort - just one of tens of thousands of ordinary African women who, without fanfare, battle the virus in their communities. 
Poorly paid or not at all, these unsung armies of mostly female community health workers have for years doled out advice and health services to families living in remote villages and urban slums who lack formal support. 
Recruited and trained by government and charities - they are found from Kenya to Tanzania, Ethiopia to Malawi, Liberia to South Africa - the women go door to door, dispensing advice on everything from family planning to immunisations. 
Now, as transmission of the new coronavirus spreads, women like Omondi are essential foot soldiers in the war on COVID-19. 
Charities such as Catholic Relief Services, which is supporting coronavirus training for about 5,000 community health volunteers in Kenya, say this workforce is key. 
“Community health volunteers are not given the recognition they deserve, but they are important frontline workers. They have a wide range of knowledge and experience from dealing with cholera outbreaks to malaria prevention,” said Moses Orinda, CRS’s senior project officer in Kenya. 
“For COVID-19, they have the ability to contact trace, provide support to home-based patients and conduct essential prevention and control activities,” Orinda said. 
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION 
The COVID-19 virus has infected close to 10 million people and killed almost half a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. 
Initially the virus multiplied more slowly in Africa than in Asia or Europe, but all 54 nations on the continent are now infected, with more than 330,000 cases and over 8,800 deaths combined, says the African Union’s Centre for Disease Control. 
South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have recorded most cases, but experts say true numbers may be much higher as many nations lack reliable diagnostic or testing capabilities. 
With densely-packed slums, poor access to water, widespread disease and weak health systems, many countries will struggle to control the fast-spreading virus, they add. 
“For now, Africa still only accounts for a small fraction of cases worldwide,” said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa director, earlier this month. 
“But the pace of the spread is quickening. Swift and early action by African countries has helped to keep numbers low, but constant vigilance is needed to stop COVID-19 from overwhelming health facilities.” 
More than half of African countries have witnessed community transmission - cases where patients have no travel history or known contact with infected people - suggesting the virus is moving undetected in the population, says WHO. 
This is not hard to believe. 
Many cities are home to sprawling, overcrowded settlements, housing tens of thousands of people, where the key to containing the spread - hand-washing and social distancing - are a luxury. 
In Kawangware, there is scant access to water or the space for self-isolation. Families of five live in one-room shacks. There is no piped water and households share toilets. 
According to the United Nations, only 14% of Kenyans have the facilities to wash their hands at home with soap and water. 
The warning from WHO is stark: up to 190,000 Africans could die if containment measures such as contact tracing, isolation, personal hygiene and distancing are not improved. 
‘INVISIBLE’ ARMIES 
Already known and respected, community health workers are a perfect first-line response to a pandemic, say health experts. 
Raj Panjabi, of Harvard Medical School and CEO of Last Mile Health, said community health workers showed their value when another deadly virus hit in Liberia. 
“When Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees, informal community providers stepped up to learn the signs and symptoms of Ebola, to team up with nurses and doctors, to go door to door to find the sick and get them into care,” he said. 
“You couldn’t have stopped the epidemic without a ground force of these community members.” 
One of their key jobs is busting myths and slaying stigmas. 
A belief that only whites get the virus or that it can be cured with hot, sweet tea is rampant, while mass testing is elusive due to the stigma a positive result can carry. 
Government health officials say the women have built up trust through years of contact so locals are happy to pay heed. 
“We know that they can pass messages on which sometimes the government cannot. They live in the same communities and have good social standing, so it is much easier for them to do provide information,” said Catherine Mugo, a sub-county community strategy coordinator at Kenya’s ministry of health. 
Mugo isn’t far wrong. 
As Omondi wends through the knot of narrow alleys that make up Kawangware, residents rush out to greet her, children give chase, and women break off from hanging washing for her advice. 
What to do if there is no money for soap? 
Borrowing a bucket, water and bleach, she shows them how to make a safe chlorine solution strong enough to kill the virus. 
Some can’t afford to buy face masks for running errands. Stay home, she orders; send out somebody who does own one. 
“Everlyne is good. She has brought us new information,” said resident Patrick Gitonga. “She has shown us new ways.” 
Health professionals and charity workers say governments need to value this workforce - to give them a living wage as well as the personal protective equipment needed to work safely. 
Omondi, who has been working as a community health volunteer for 10 years without pay and is responsible for 100 households in her neighbourhood, would welcome some recognition. 
“Having a salary or some stipend would be really useful,” said Omondi, whose five-strong family struggles to get by. 
“But you know, most of us are doing this work because we have something in (our) heart that tells us that we cannot let our neighbour suffer.” (Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla and Emeline Wuilbercq, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

PANAMA CITY, June 26 (Reuters) - Former world boxing champion Roberto “Hands of Stone” Duran tested positive for coronavirus after being admitted to a hospital center with flu-like symptoms, the pugilist’s son said on Thursday. 
“My father’s exams have just arrived and confirm that he is positive for COVID-19,” Robin Duran said on his Instagram account. 
“For now he still doesn’t show symptoms, beyond a simple cold, he is not in intensive care, nor on a respirator, he is still under observation,” he added. 
The 69-year-old Panamanian former boxer retired in 2001 and is considered one of the best lightweights in history. He fought over five decades, held four different world titles, and his record stands at 103 wins, with 70 knockouts and 16 losses. 
Known for his aggressive punching power, Duran, who grew up in Panama City’s poor El Chorillo district and won his first title in 1972, is today regarded as a national hero. 
“The doctor tells us his lungs are fine and there are no signs of seriousness. Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well,” said Robin Duran.

The country’s annualised production rose by 718,000 tonnes to 36.56 million tonnes over the first five months of this year, the latest estimate from the International Aluminium Institute (IAI) found. 
China’s share of global output touched 57% in May. Since the IAI first started using its own assessments of Chinese production, the country has only exceeded that level a couple of times in 2018, a year of record national output. 
Annualised run-rates in the rest of the world decreased by 612,000 tonnes over the January-May 2020 period. That decline in part reflected curtailments because of lockdowns but low international prices are starting to take a toll on Western smelters. 
China is already the world’s largest aluminium producer. 
It’s hard to see how its dominance will not increase, particularly since the U.S. Administration’s venting of its aluminium frustrations on Canada reduces the chances of multilateral action to stop it. 
CHINA - RAMPING UP AGAIN 
Chinese aluminium production fell last year for the first time in a decade. That was largely the result of unplanned outages at a couple of the country’s biggest producers and the analysts’ consensus was always for a renewed growth spurt this year. 
Annualised monthly production rates jumped the 36-million level at the start of 2020 and have remained above it ever since. 
There was a small dip in run-rates in March at the peak of China’s lockdowns, which coincided with a price trough on the Shanghai Futures Exchange aluminium contract. 
But cumulative production was still up by 2% in January-May after a 1.0% contraction last year. 
Shanghai prices have rebounded from their March slump, easing some of the previous financial stress on the country’s operators. 
New smelters, meanwhile, continue to come online. Yunnan Aluminium announced last month the commissioning of a 500,000-tonne per year plant in the Wenshan region of the province. 
Wenshan is an emerging Chinese production hub as producers migrate from older coal-powered smelters in other parts of the country towards Yunnan’s cleaner hydro power. 
In principle, such new capacity has to be matched by the closure of older capacity but the process inevitably involves capacity creep because the new smelters are more efficient than those they are replacing. 
In practice, it’s not always clear whether the older capacity was even operating. 
Either way, almost half way through 2020 and Chinese aluminium production is clearly growing again. 
Moreover, Beijing’s mandated cap on national capacity at 45 million tonnes allows plenty of leeway for further upwards creep. 
COVID-19 RECOVERY BUT PRICE PAIN GROWS 
As with their Chinese counterparts, most Western smelter operations have not been directly affected by COVID-19. 
The notable exception was Argentinian producer Aluar, which temporarily shuttered half of its 460,000-tonne per year capacity during the country’s lockdown. 
The country’s aluminium production was down an average 17% over the January-May period with Aluar operating at 54% of capacity in May, local consultancy Economic Trends found. 
The heavier toll from COVID-19 has been on demand and price. London Metal Exchange (LME) inventories have been rising steeply as unsold metal spills from the physical to the paper market, where it can be financed. 
The LME price is trading around $1,590 per tonne and struggling to stage any significant recovery from last month’s four-year low of $1,460. 
The resulting squeeze on smelter margins is starting to take a toll. 
Alcoa has announced the permanent closure of its Ferndale smelter in the U.S. state of Washington. The plant was already operating at reduced capacity of 230,000 tonnes. 
The U.S. producer has also initiated talks with unions at its similar-sized San Ciprian smelter in Spain over a possible closure decision. 
Rio Tinto has two smelters, one in Iceland and one in New Zealand, under strategic review. 
True, there are expansions under way elsewhere. 
Gulf production is booming, up 13% last year and a further 6% in January-May this year as Aluminium Bahrain ramps up its new 540,000-tonne per year Potline 6 expansion. 
Malaysia’s Press Metal is also aiming to lift capacity from 760,000 tonnes per year to 1,080,000 through its Phase 3 smelter due for commissioning at the start of next year. 
But by that time at least one more non-Chinese smelter is likely to have bitten the dust. 
The financial crisis a decade ago took out a swath of Western aluminium smelters with China’s share of global production rising to 49% at the end of 2012 from 29% at the start of 2009. 
COVID-19 is generating the same bearish mix of weak demand, surplus metal, low prices and Chinese production exuberance. 
POLITICAL DISUNITY 
As China’s smelter capacity has grown so too have its exports of semi-manufactured products. 
Semis shipments have slowed this year to the tune of 10% as overseas demand collapsed but at 1.5 million tonnes, the cumulative total is still a lot of aluminium, particularly in the current demand environment. 
China’s exports have long generated international push-back, often in the form of punitive duties. 
There had been building momentum towards a multilateral forum to engage directly with Beijing over its continued build-out of aluminium capacity. 
Unfortunately, President Trump doesn’t do multilateral forums. He chose instead to impose a blanket tariff of 10% on all U.S. imports with exceptions for a couple of close allies 
Canada was exempted last year but is faces renewed tariffs after an alleged surge of metal entering the U.S. market. 
Such national friction means there is no international political check on China’s continuing creep towards that elevated 45-million tonne capacity threshold. 
In its absence, there is no reason for China not to continue what it is doing, which is to produce more aluminium.

(Reuters) - The number of people hospitalized in California with COVID-19 has increased by nearly a third over the past two weeks, with about 1,500 suspected or confirmed patients requiring intensive care, officials said on Wednesday. 
The state also reported its largest ever spike in confirmed new cases on Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom told a news briefing. Further increases are expected when test results from people who participated in massive anti-racism protests start coming in, he said. 
Coronavirus infections and hospitalizations have also risen sharply in other parts of the United States. 
California’s 7,149 new infections announced Wednesday brought the state total to 190,222, caused partly by a rise in testing, Newsom said. But much is the result of people failing to engage in safe practices when gathering with friends and family, or visiting newly reopened businesses, he said. 
“These numbers do beg the question and that is what can we do more to keep you safe from the spread of this virus,” Newsom said. 
He criticized local officials in parts of the state who said they would not enforce public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus’ spread, including a new statewide requirement that people wear masks in public. 
Counties that flaunt the rules risk losing state funds meant to help defray pandemic costs, he said. 
Hospitalizations are up 29% over the past two weeks, and 30% of the state’s available intensive care beds are being taken up by COVID-19 patients, Newsom said. 
Many cases could still be undetected. Newsom said several counties were having trouble paying for tests, to the point where some areas were “testing deserts.”

Hospitals and other health-care customers advised by Vizient increased orders of the drug by more than 600% after the researchers announced their findings last week. Manufacturers were only able to fill around half of those orders, Vizient said. 
“What we’re hearing from our members is that they are able to treat the patients who do require dexamethasone - they are treating them and they have product,” Steven Lucio, vice president of pharmacy solutions at Vizient, said in an interview. “The concern is, Can the market continue to sustain this?” 
Vizient’s data shows that hospitals are increasingly putting the drug into use to treat COVID-19 patients, confirming what several U.S. hospitals in hard-hit parts of the country told Reuters last week. 
According to Oxford University researchers, dexamethasone reduced death rates by nearly a third among COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical breathing assistance. 
The injectable version of dexamethasone has been in shortage in the U.S. since February of last year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Still, German drugmaker Fresenius SE’s Kabi unit - by far the largest supplier to the U.S. market - says it has good inventory on hand of the steroid and is ramping up production in three of its U.S. factories to meet the surging demand. 
“Fresenius Kabi is confident we can meet customers’ needs with COVID-related medicines such as dexamethasone,” spokesman Matthew Kuhn said in an email.

Remdesivir is indicated for moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 for patients in intensive care who require oxygen, while Favipiravir is indicated for mild to moderate cases. 
Eva Pharma, a generic drugmaker established in 1997, said earlier this month it had received a licence from Gilead Sciences Inc to make Remdesivir in Egypt and distribute it in 127 countries. 
It will initially make 500,000 doses a month to be sold locally for less than 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($124.07) each, said general manager Amgad Talaat, adding that they had already started delivering the medicine to quarantine hospitals. 
It has also started producing 1 million Favipiravir tablets a month, which will be on the market within two to three weeks, Talaat said. The price has still to be finalised. 
Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp, which makes Favipiravir under the brand name Avigan, said this month its research on the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment may need to continue until July. 
Eva Pharma said it had received permission from Egypt’s pharmaceutical regulatory authority to produce the drugs, and the body would decided whether they could be sold in pharmacies or only used in hospitals. 
Talaat said that once Egyptian needs were met, Eva Pharma hoped to sell any excess doses to other Middle Eastern and African countries. 
Egypt’s Rameda Pharmaceutical also said this month it had begun making Favipiravir under the brand name Anviziram and had approval to manufacture Remedsivir.

Croatia’s Borna Coric, Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria and Viktor Troicki have previously tested positive after playing in Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region. 
“The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested,” the 33-year-old said in a statement, adding that he was not showing any symptoms. “My result is positive, just as Jelena’s (wife), while the results of our children are negative. 
“I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and that everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days.” 
The tournament witnessed packed stands during the opening leg in Belgrade, players hugging at the net, playing basketball, posing for pictures and attending press conferences together. 
Djokovic organised nights out in Belgrade for the players and pictures and videos of him dancing with the other participants at his event were posted on social media. 
With both Serbia and Croatia easing lockdown measures weeks before the event, players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules in either country. 
Djokovic said the idea behind his tournament was noble and he wanted to raise funds for players in need. 
“Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions,” said Djokovic, who is also the head of the players council of the men’s ATP Tour. “Our tournament meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region. 
“The Tour has been designed to help both established and up and coming tennis players from South-Eastern Europe to gain access to some competitive tennis while the various tours are on hold due to the COVID-19 situation.” 
A following statement confirmed that the remainder of the Adria Tour had been cancelled, the two-day event on July 3 and 4 in Banja Luka, Bosnia and the planned exhibition match with Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in Sarajevo on July 5. 
“We are extremely disappointed to have to cancel the events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo,” said Novak’s brother Djordje Djokovic, the director of the Adria Tour. 
“We were looking forward to treating fans in these two cities to watching Novak Djokovic and other top players. Unfortunately, the recent events make everyone’s speedy recovery a top priority.”

By Deena Beasley and Nick Brown 
June 28 (Reuters) - In the six months since an entirely new coronavirus began spreading around the world, doctors and hospitals have learned a lot about how to treat patients with COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the virus. 
What doctors have learned about fighting COVID-19: 
* Patients are at increased risk of blood clots, and blood thinning agents can help. 
* “Proning” - putting patients on their stomachs to relieve pressure on the lungs - can stave off the need for mechanical ventilation. 
* Besides the respiratory system and lungs, the coronavirus can attack many other organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. 
* The most promising treatments so far seem to be the anti-viral remdesivir; dexamethasone, a steroid to treat the body’s inflammatory response to COVID-19; and plasma donated by patients who have antibodies to the disease. 
* More widespread testing and quicker results helps relieve pressure on hospitals. 
* Information-sharing among health professionals worldwide is crucial. 
* Prevention is critical. Doctors are relying on the public to do their part with good hygiene, masks and social distancing. 
Some of the biggest unknowns: 
* Exactly which treatments will work for which patients. 
* How quickly some treatments will gain widespread distribution, especially remdesivir. 
* How long it will take for COVID-19 patients to recover. 
* The long-term effects of the infection. 
“If the best lesson we’ve learned is to turn patients onto their stomachs instead of their backs,” said Valory Wangler, chief medical officer at Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Services, in Gallup, New Mexico, “it means we’re far from a miracle cure.” (Reporting By Deena Beasley and Nick Brown; Editing by Marla Dickerson and William Mallard)"

ZURICH, June 24 (Reuters) - Switzerland’s government will pay for coronavirus testing, it said on Wednesday, as it approved the launch of its proximity tracing app from Thursday to prevent a resurgence of the virus as restrictions are relaxed. 
The government said it would take over costs for all virus and antibody tests, and would simplify the system for testing, effective from Thursday, the same day when an app to alert individuals potentially exposed to the virus will go live. 
Switzerland’s restrictions have been eased in recent weeks, with shops and schools reopening, along with restaurants - although with limits on the number of people allowed to be present. 
Until now, coronavirus tests were partly paid for by the regional governments and individual health insurance schemes, meaning some people had to pay themselves. 
“This scheme has meant that not all patients have been treated the same,” the government said. “There has been a danger that people are not being tested when they have to pay for it themselves.” 
It said it would pay 169 Swiss francs ($178.72) for virus tests and 113 francs for antibody tests. 
So far 1,682 people have died in Switzerland from COVID-19. 
While the country’s infection rate has slowed, with 31,376 people testing positive for the virus, new infections ticked up on Wednesday, according to figures from the Federal Office of Health, with 44 more cases than the day before. 
The government also on Wednesday approved regulations allowing its voluntary COVID-19 tracing appwith which it hopes to alert people potentially infected with the virus, so they can be quarantined and prevent its spreadingto go live. 
Under the system, an infected person enters a code onto their mobile phone, and if they come within 1.5 metres of someone else with the app, a message is sent telling the exposed person they may have caught the virus, so they can be tested. 
The app’s installation is voluntary and potentially exposed persons will only be notified with the express consent of the infected individual, the regulation says.

LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Budget airline easyJet has raised about 419 million pounds ($520 million) through a share placing to help bolster its finances after the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the travel industry. 
The new equity will help boost its liquidity to about 3 billion pounds, easyJet said on Thursday, enabling it to survive for many more months even if planes are grounded again, and putting it in a strong position to cope with “protracted recovery scenarios”. 
EasyJet’s planes returned to the air in mid-June, but with a minimal service as lockdowns to contain the pandemic were gradually eased. The airline is hoping to ramp up flying as the year goes on, but demand is being hampered by UK quarantine rules and consumer nervousness. 
Airlines are hoping Britain agrees travel deals with other countries to allow restriction-free movement between some European countries. An announcement could come on or before the quarantine rules are reviewed on June 29. 
EasyJet said it had placed a total of 59.5 million new ordinary shares at 703 pence apiece, after announcing the move late Wednesday. 
Its shares fell 5.4% to 699 pence in early Thursday trading. They have approximately halved in value since the start of the year. 
EasyJet has said it does not expect passenger demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 and is planning to axe up to 4,500 jobs. 
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said the airline was already making progress with cost cutting. 
“EasyJet has a compelling proposition of lower cost structures and strong positions in better markets. For investors looking to buy into the recovery in Europe, easyJet should be on the shopping list,” he said in a note. 
British Airways, owned by IAG, has said it needs to shed 12,000 jobs and there has been media speculation that IAG could also raise new equity. 
Qatar Airways, IAG’s biggest shareholder, has said it would inject equity into IAG if needed.

$75,000 will get you a Boston Dynamics Spot robot
The robot dog the internet loves is going on sale.
We’ve seen Boston Dynamics’ four-legged robotic dog, Spot, help triage patients with COVID-19, hold the door for a fellow bot, herd sheep and more. But until now, Spot was only available under short-term lease in Boston Dynamics’ Early Adopter Program. Now, businesses in the US can buy their very own Spot robots. Costs will vary, though. 
The Spot Explorer, designed for developers looking to work with Spot, makes one robot available for $74,500. Additional batteries and add-ons, like LIDAR, can run from $4,620 to $18,450. Spot is meant for commercial and industrial use, and orders are subject to Boston Dynamics’ terms, which require “beneficial use” of the robots.Continue reading.
NBA restart plan includes using Oura rings to catch COVID-19 symptoms
The league’s ‘bubble’ will be full of wearable devices.
As the NBA moves toward restarting its season with players and other personnel isolated at Walt Disney World in Orlando, details of how it hopes to manage the people on site are leaking out. 
The part specifically interesting to us — other than players-only lounges with NBA 2K to play and bracelets that beep if people are within six feet of each other for too long — is its proposed use of Oura’s smart rings. Earlier this month, a study suggested that physiological data from the rings, combined with information obtained from wearers via in-app surveys, can “forecast and predict the onset of COVID-19 related symptoms” three days in advance, with 90 percent accuracy.
According to The Athletic, use of the rings will be optional, and there’s no word on what other data will help track possible symptoms. ESPN reporter Zach Lowe says that if players wear the rings, team personnel will not have access unless it detects an “illness probability score” that triggers a medical review.Continue reading.
The first FDA-approved prescription video game will help kids with ADHD

The FDA has approved the first video game in the country that can be prescribed as treatment. It’s entitled EndeavorRx, and while it’s not exactly comparable to your favorite AAA video games, it’s designed to improve the attention function of kids with ADHD. To be exact, it was developed for pediatric patients ages 8 to 12 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD.
While users will be able to download it from their mobile devices’ app store — and it doesn’t need any special equipment — it’s intended for use as part of a therapeutic program, which could also include medication and other types of therapy.Continue reading.

The staff members said they hope the organization will allow them to work from home but have felt pressured to report to their offices at the new $1.2 billion Globe Life Field in Arlington. 
“We are terrified for our safety,” an employee who requested anonymity told ESPN. “Terrified to share COVID-19, unknowingly, with an older employee, a pregnant co-worker or anyone else who may have some sort of underlying condition. We all knew it would come to this. It was only a matter of time.” 
More than 100 people work in the team’s executive offices and more than 200 employees are at the stadium on a daily basis, according to the report. 
The team said the offices will be sanitized this weekend and employees can be tested on Monday and Tuesday. 
The Rangers issued a statement Friday acknowledging the recent positive tests for the coronavirus. 
“Over the last 48 hours, the Texas Rangers have received notification that several of our employees have received a positive test for COVID-19. The Rangers immediately began the protocols that we have in place for positive COVID tests, and any employee who had direct contact with these individuals was sent home and will undergo COVID-19 testing,” the statement said. “No individuals will be allowed back into the facility without receiving a negative COVID-19 test. 
“The health and safety of our employees are a top priority, and the Rangers will continue to diligently enforce the pandemic protocols that are in place for front office employees at Globe Life Field. These include temperature checks upon entering the building, mandatory wearing of face coverings, and regular sanitation and cleaning of the Globe Life Field facilities.” 
Texas was among the first states to reopen following coronavirus lockdowns. Employees began returning to work at Globe Life Field in early May. But coronavirus cases in the state have spiked over the past 10 days, with Texas reporting 5,707 new cases on Friday the fourth straight day with more than 5,400. 
Workers told ESPN that social distancing protocols became more difficult to follow and the use of masks became less prevalent as more and more people were allowed at the facility, which began hosting high school graduations in May. 
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said earlier this week that sports teams could allow attendance of up to 50 percent capacity, which would mean more than 20,000 fans at Globe Life Field when games are scheduled to begin later this month.

* Tin is LME Star Performer: tmsnrt.rs/2VBX4gT
By Andy Home 
LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - COVID-19 has generated the most severe demand shock for industrial metals since the financial crisis a decade ago. 
The first-round impact came from the lockdown of key demand sectors such as automotive. The second-round hit, which is still playing out, comes from slumping corporate and household confidence as the economic fall-out from the fatal coronavirus travels around the globe. 
But COVID-19 has also affected metals supply in the form of mine and smelter closures due to national quarantine measures. 
The impact is not uniform but rather reflects each metal’s unique supply profile. 
Aluminium production, for example, has been left largely unscathed, with most governments, except Argentina, designating smelters as critical industries that could continue operating. 
Tin and zinc, by contrast, have seen significant disruption, partly because of a particularly hard lockdown in Peru, a major producer of both metals. 
This game of lockdown lottery isn’t over either. 
The focus right now is turning to copper and Chile, the world’s largest producer of the red metal, where the coronavirus appears to be still spreading through the production sector. 
TIN - METAL HIT 
COVID-19 lockdowns at one stage knocked out three of the world’s five largest tin producers outside of China. 
Peru’s Minsur, Bolivia’s EM Vinto and Malaysia Smelting Corp. accounted for a cumulative 55,400 tonnes of production last year, representing 17% of global output. 
All three are vertically integrated producers, meaning both mines and smelters were curtailed, directly affecting the availability of refined tin. 
This has translated into tin being the out-performer of the base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange. (LME) 
Currently trading at $16,800 per tonne, LME three-month tin is now down only 2% since the start of the year. 
It helps that tin supply was already stressed. 
China, the world’s largest producer, has been struggling with a shortage of domestic raw material and disruption to the flow of concentrate from Myanmar, the country’s largest supplier. 
China flipped to being a net importer of refined tin in September last year and it has remained so ever since. Cumulative net imports totalled 2,600 tonnes in the first four months of 2020. Last year, by contrast, it was a net exporter of 3,600 tonnes over the same period. 
With Indonesia’s PT Timah also slashing its 2020 sales target to 55,000 tonnes, it’s evident that COVID-19 has significantly exacerbated existing supply pressures. 
ZINC - MINE HIT 
Measured by mine production, zinc has been hardest hit by lockdowns, particularly that in Peru, a major supplier of concentrates to the world’s smelters. 
Analysts at Macquarie Bank estimate over 500,000 tonnes of lost production, representing more than 4% of global supply. (“COVID-19 base metal supply cuts - June Update”, June 24, 2020) 
JP Morgan analysts have a higher assessment of 790,000 tonnes after factoring in price-related closures. (“Metals Weekly - supply disruption round-up”, June 22, 2020). 
The latter is a reminder that the zinc supply chain was in a very different place to tin before the world first heard of the new coronavirus. 
After a raw materials squeeze in 2017 and 2018, the zinc market was swinging to surplus with Chinese smelters ramping up production and the price sinking. 
This bear narrative has been challenged but remains largely intact, which is why the zinc price reaction to the loss of so much concentrate has been muted. 
Rather, the real turnaround has taken place in the zinc concentrates market segment. 
This year’s benchmark treatment charges, which are charged by a smelter for converting concentrates into refined metal, came in at a 12-year high of $299.97, reflecting an abundance of raw material. 
Spot charges in China, the world’s largest smelting hub, have since fallen to $155 per tonne, according to state metals research house Antaike. 
There are now signs that the cut in concentrates supply is feeding through to refined production, with China’s national output falling by 6% in May relative to April. 
But with mines in Peru now starting to reopen, the impact on full-year refined metal output looks containable. 
For now. 
FOCUS ON COPPER AND CHILE 
Any assessment of how much metal production has been lost due to COVID-19 comes with an important caveat, namely that the virus has been successfully contained in producing countries. 
Which is why copper and Chile are now in focus. 
Although some major Peruvian copper mines were curtailed during lockdown, those in Chile largely carried on operating with the government taking a relatively light touch to a core export earner. 
Chile’s national production of copper actually grew by 3.6% in January-April compared with last year, Macquarie notes. 
Relative to size of market, the bank estimates copper mine supply has been less impacted than either zinc or nickel, while in terms of refined metal supply, copper has experienced the lowest losses among the base metals. 
JP Morgan pegs copper mine losses at around 440,000 tonnes, citing figures from research house CRU, and notes that is still only around 40% of the bank’s allowance for “normal” supply disruption this year. 
But Chile’s light copper quarantine measures may be back-firing as coronavirus cases within the sector increase. 
Unions have been pressuring companies to do more for the safety of their members, particularly those working for state operator Codelco, which has recorded three COVID-19 fatalities. 
The company has just announced it is suspending smelting operations at its Chuquicamata division to focus reduced manpower and resources on maintaining basic mining operations. 
Chuquicamata is Codelco’s second-largest volume operation after El Teniente with production last year of 385,000 tonnes. 
The suspension of smelter operations is “transitory”, the company said, implying a relative quick return to business as usual. 
But the coronavirus, not Codelco, will determine just how long the closure will last and whether the company might have to curtail more operations. 
As JP Morgan notes, “it’s still a bit early to have strong confidence in a view that there will not potentially be a second wave of closures, particularly given the comparatively high rate of infection in Chile and Latin America in general”. 
The key take-away is that COVID-19 is still far from defeated and until it is, the hit to metal supply remains a moving target.

AMSTERDAM, June 24 (Reuters) - Dutch insurer NN Group said on Wednesday it expects an impact of about 100 million euros ($113.14 million) on its operating profit due to the fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak, but solvency remains strong at 227% as of the end of May. 
In an update ahead of an investor day, Chief Executive Officer David Knibbe said the company is targeting cash generation of 1.5 billion euros in 2023. 
“The impact on claims experience so far is limited, as we have no or limited exposure to business interruption, travel and health insurance,” the company said of the coronavirus impact. “Our sales in Europe and Japan will likely be affected, leading to lower premiums, and we expect market volatility to result in lower fee income in our asset management business.” 
NN’s shares closed at 30.13 euros on Tuesday, down 11% so far this year. 
Earlier this month, activist shareholder Elliott Advisors, which holds a 3% stake in NN Group, proposed a series of actions the insurer should take to raise its share price, including “operational improvements, reinsurance transactions and outright business sales”. 
CEO Knibbe said the company considered Elliott’s advice. 
“I don’t have anything exactly to tell you,” Knibbe told reporters on a call. 
“We had constructive meetings with them” as part of broader meetings with stakeholders ahead of the update. 
He said the company had no plans to sell its Japanese operations, one of Elliott’s proposals, because that business is profitable and provides the group with diversity. 
NN Group said it would gradually decrease its exposure to low-yielding investments, which Elliott had recommended. The insurer said it would cut some government bonds holdings in favour of mortgages, loans and real estate. 
NN Group, which reports earnings twice every year, had core profit of 1.8 billion euros in 2019.

Don’t expect this to change minds, however. Academy leaders Dawn Hudson and David Rubin maintained that there was “no greater way” to experience movies than at a theater, and that this was meant to support “members and colleagues during this time of uncertainty.” When it’s safe to resume theater screenings, the Academy will allow movies that exhibit in cities beyond LA, including Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area."

It added that the coverage and speed goals were “out of sync” with each other and weren’t “feasible,” such as tripling speeds from 100Mbps in 2023 to 300Mbps a year later. For testing, T-Mobile maintained that it was already subject to two independent tests and that a third would be “burdensome.”"

Canalys pegged the worldwide drop in Q1 at 13 percent from last year, while Strategy Analytics saw the numbers plunge by 17 percent. According to Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, “Samsung’s global marketshare is holding steady at over 21 percent, and it remains the world’s top smartphone brand.” That continues to be followed by Huawei and Apple, as all the major manufacturers shared in a hit to their sales. The companies that remained flat or showed growth according to the analysts included Xiaomi and Vivo, owing to strong sales in India where some products launched before lockdowns began."

Last week, the two companies seeded the API to developers in preparation for a full rollout. In the months to come, exposure notification functionality may be built into operating systems, allowing them to be sent out without the use of separate app. And once the pandemic is over, Google and Apple have said they’ll disable the system."

Another example of the listing suggests Sony has stopped hiring for the role, although it’s not clear if that’s due to a successful hire.
Whether or not the PS5 arrives in October is another matter. Outside of the original PlayStation launch, Sony has typically chosen to debut its flagship consoles in November. There’s also the not-so-small question of how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the system’s premiere. Production won’t necessarily be affected at this stage, but late development, distribution and game availability might.

That is one of our big visions,” Agabi said.
Devices that can supposedly test travelers for traces of dangerous chemicals have met with very limited success, so it’s easy to be skeptical about any new tech. However, the fact that it’s being tested by Airbus is a good sign for Koniku, a relatively small company with just 20 employees. Airbus has been working with Koniku since 2017 and said they plan to create “a game-changing, end-to-end security solution.”"

""The COVID-19 pandemic today reached a milestone in Africa, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. The virus has now spread to every country in the continent since the first case was confirmed in the region 14 weeks ago,"" the WHO said in a statement, noting there were 3,100 confirmed deaths on the vast continent.
Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, who is from Botswana, said: ""For now COVID-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world.""
Even so, she said, ""We must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.""
About half of African countries are experiencing community transmission of the virus, the WHO said.
The situation in South America appeared graver. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, speaking earlier to a news conference, said: ""In a sense South America has become a new epicenter for the disease.""
Brazil is the ""most affected,"" and authorities there have approved broad use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19, he said. He reiterated that clinical evidence does not support the drug's widespread use against the disease, given its risks.
Nine African countries had 50% rises in cases in the past week, while others have seen a decline or have stable rates, Ryan said.
The low mortality rate may be because half the continent's population is 18 or younger, he said, while saying he remains worried the disease will spread on a continent with ""significant gaps"" in intensive care services, medical oxygen and ventilation.

 (CNN)Just before the Covid-19 quarantine, I joined my fellow hosts on Turner Classic Movies for an ""Old Hollywood"" fashion photo shoot for Emmy Magazine. But when the spread came out, I could not bring myself to post the photos to my social media. As an African American cinema and media studies professor, how could I promote the glamour of classic Hollywood when our current media landscape was exploding with scenes of racial crisis? 
Day after day, I scrolled through posts decrying the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. For weeks, video after video showed the escalating protests against police brutality and the brutal treatment of protesters by police. It seemed inappropriate to share shots glorifying Hollywood's golden age in this moment of mourning and mobilization. Moreover, the classic films we showcase on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) have played a major role in perpetuating the racist beliefs that devalue Black lives and normalize the use of excessive force against Black people.
No wonder that many viewers were outraged when HBO Max rolled out with the Civil War romance ""Gone with the Wind"" on its roster. HBO Max has temporarily pulled the film with the intent to return it to their service with additional historical context. 
Originally released in 1939, the film romanticizes slavery as a benign and benevolent institution. Still the highest-grossing film in history when adjusted for inflation, ""Gone with the Wind"" continues to have a profound impact on the ways mainstream audiences visualize the antebellum South and the Reconstruction period that followed the Civil War. 
There have been many highly visible efforts to represent slavery on screen from more historically accurate African American perspectives, from the 1977 miniseries ""Roots"" to Oprah Winfrey's ""Beloved"" (1998) to Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). But ""Gone with the Wind"" endures in popular culture. It is an account of slavery devoid of the physical abuse (save Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara's legendary slap of Butterfly McQueen's Prissy), the grueling labor and the separation of families. Over the decades, ""Gone with the Wind"" has seen many theatrical re-releases, featured presentations on prime-time network television and spectacularly packaged home video editions. It was the very first film shown on Turner Classic Movies when the network premiered in 1994. And then this behemoth of classic films, clocking in at nearly four hours, made the leap into the world of on-demand streaming. 
Some complained that taking the film down was a form of censorship. For others, seeing ""Gone with the Wind"" featured so prominently in HBO Max's launch felt like salt rubbed into wounds that have never been permitted to heal. These wounds are reopened with every act of anti-Black violence, every delay in justice and every failure to acknowledge the extent of Black suffering. 
But it is precisely because of the ongoing, painful patterns of racial injustice and disregard for Black lives that ""Gone with the Wind"" should stay in circulation and remain available for viewing, analysis and discussion. 
""Gone with the Wind"" is a prime text for examining expressions of white supremacy in popular culture. Based on Margaret Mitchell's blockbuster novel, ""Gone with the Wind"" taps into longstanding myths about the gentility of the antebellum South. The film's lavish costumes, magnificent plantation sets and sweeping Technicolor cinematography render Scarlett O'Hara's romances and economic tribulations in grand melodramatic fashion. 
As the title indicates, ""Gone with the Wind"" looks back nostalgically at idyllic days that are no more (because they never were). By harkening back to the great old days, plantation dramas invite white viewers to imagine appealing but false pedigrees. When working class and poor white viewers identify with a noble white lineage, for example, they might be less likely to form what could be beneficial alliances with their Black working class and poor counterparts. 
The film is also a valuable document of and testimony to Black performance during an era when substantial roles for Black talent were extremely rare in Hollywood films. As film historian Donald Boglehas argued, the extraordinarily talented Black actors in ""Gone with the Wind"" -- particularly Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning performance as Mammy, and Butterfly McQueen as the comically inept Prissy -- bring notable humanity to their stereotypical roles. Too often, these characters are deemed either harmless or harmful. 
Mammy and Prissy are often read either as benign features of a movie that merely reflects its times or as victims of Hollywood's longstanding, pervasive racism. However, when we look carefully at their acting styles, we see how McDaniel and McQueen nuance their characters with their unique facial expressions, gestures, vocal inflections and brands of humor. They ""steal the show,"" to borrow the phrase scholar Miriam Petty uses to describe how Black actors in classic Hollywood films maximize the impact of their minimal roles.
At the same time, ""Gone with the Wind"" illustrates how trenchant racism has restricted Black possibilities, as well as the efforts of well-meaning white allies. Producer David O. Selznick supported Hattie McDaniels' nomination for an Academy Award, believing in the strength of her performance. But he capitulated to Southern sensibilities when he did not include Black cast members at the film's premiere in Atlanta. And at the 12th Academy Awards ceremony, where she became the first Black actor to win an Oscar, McDaniel did not sit at Selznick's table with the rest of the cast. She had to be given special permission by management to enter the whites-only Cocoanut Grove club and was seated at a small table on the side of the room.
A spokesperson for HBO Max noted in a statement that the film's ""racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible."" As the current debates about putting up, taking down, and contextualizing ""Gone with the Wind"" make clear, it is a film that continues to expose deep fissures in our interpretations of American history, film history and the relationship between the two. The film has loyal fans, and it has vocal critics who critique its version of Southern history with the same language Black activists used when they picketed the film 80 years ago. But as I saw at a jam-packed panel discussion on ""The Complicated Legacy of 'Gone with the Wind'"" at the 2019 TCM Classic Film Festival, there are people who love the film, and others who love to hate it, and still others who are nonetheless curious about how other folks respond to it. 
HBO Max will bring ""Gone with The Wind"" back to its line-up, and when it appears, I will provide an introduction placing the film in its multiple historical contexts. For me, this is an opportunity to think about what classic films can teach us. Right now, people are turning to movies for racial re-education, and the top-selling books on Amazon are about anti-racism and racial inequality. If people are really doing their homework, we may be poised to have our most informed, honest and productive national conversations yet about Black lives on screen and off."

 (CNN)It's May -- Asian Pacific American Heritage Month -- a time to celebrate and commemorate this vibrant community. That's not happening now, or at least not in the same way. With Covid-19 making it impossible for us to gather in person, organizations are trying to adapt. Film festivals have gone virtual. Theater and music groups are hosting performances from artists' living rooms. Galas are being held as Zoom parties, with links to online auction and donation platforms. 
But technical difficulties are far from the only challenge Asian Americans face today. While the pandemic is showing promising signs of decline in some states, there is evidence to suggest xenophobic hatred that has emerged in its wake is poised to escalate. Asian Americans have reported surging hate crimes and attacks, triggered by the association of Covid-19 with China, where the outbreak was first detected. 
Racial slurs and cultural slander have erupted both online and off, prompted in part by the unfounded beliefs that the outbreak in Wuhan occurred due to poor hygiene or the consumption of strange animals (""bat soup""). When an increasing number of Americans began to fall ill and die, these whisper campaigns sharpened into personal attacks and even physical violence against a wide range of Asians many of whom were mistaken for being Chinese. 
To make matters worse, President Donald Trump has already signaled that he intends to amplify anti-Chinese hysteria and xenophobic hatred as part of his reelection strategy. And it's clear that easing lockdown restrictions in America is only going to create more opportunities for racists to target Asian Americans, with potentially catastrophic results for our communities. 
Here's the problem: Asian American national advocacy organizations were already facing a period of crisis even before the pandemic broke. Initiatives that serve the community have insufficient funding. This has forced groups that have led coalition building across our communities in the past to cut staffing, hampering their ability to organize, and threatening their survival in the future.
This isn't to say our community is standing still or staying quiet. Ad hoc platforms and campaigns have sprung up to respond to these needs. Multicultural marketing agency IW Group brought influencers together to reach hundreds of thousands of viewers with #WashTheHate, an online campaign to raise awareness of racist attacks against Asian Americans and promote solidarity across all communities. Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council launched an online anti-Asian bias tracker that has registered nearly 1,500 incidents to date, providing a useful tool for policy makers to address this problem; Asian American ad agency Admerasia has partnered with these groups to create a site called Racism Is Contagious that tracks verbal and physical assaults against Asians on a regularly updated national map. Gold House, a group of high-profile Asian American celebrities, entrepreneurs and creators, recently unveiled We Are #AllAmericans, a star-studded campaign to push back on racism and xenophobia across all communities, while raising funds for Covid-19 relief. 
These are powerful and vital tools to fight back against the surge in reported racism. But they also reflect a fragmentation of purpose, with different groups launching their own campaigns instead of coalescing behind a single forceful initiative. That kind of unity is what might really be required to counter the dark messages emanating from the highest levels of our federal government, and stoking anti-Asian American sentiments that have recurred too frequently in our history: That we don't belong in this country, that we pose a threat to ""real Americans,"" and that we speak with the voices and faces of an implacable alien enemy. 
""The Covid-19 crisis has shown that we are unprepared to respond (to this kind of crisis),"" Fue Lee, a Hmong American organizer who unseated a longtime incumbent to become a Minnesota state representative in 2016, told me. ""Outreach and engagement were slow, late, and did not reflect the diversity within the Asian American community."" 
Lee found similar concerns among other Asian Pacific American state and locally elected officials, like California state assemblymember David Chiu, who heads the state's Asian Pacific American legislative caucus; New York state assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou; Washington state representative Sharon Tomiko Santos; and Boston city councilor Michelle Wu.
The group has brought together nearly 100 other organizations and prominent AAPI leaders for what they're calling Rise APA a series of town halls taking place throughout the month of May that are designed to elevate the conversation about rising xenophobia and the Covid-19 crisis in Asian Pacific American communities to the national level. The events will feature participants like playwright David Henry Hwang, Pulitzer-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen and former US Ambassador to China Gary Locke.
But the organizers are looking at these town halls as a springboard, not a destination. Their hope is that once this pandemic is brought under control and the nation begins to reopen, organizers of the Rise APA sessions and the network of leaders supporting it will be able to convene in person to actively discuss a common agenda for the coming decades. 
""We have the chance to speak up not just against this current wave of hatred, but to build the community infrastructure to amplify our voices and leadership for the next generation,"" Boston city councilor Wu told me. 
Because even if this pandemic passes, anti-Asian discrimination and exclusion will likely not. It has emerged throughout American history, and unfortunately there's no reason to believe that this cycle will break on its own. 
""We have seen this all before with the Chinese Exclusion Act, the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans, the murder of Vincent Chin and post-9/11 anti-Muslim bigotry,"" assemblymember Chiu told me. ""And while our community has come a long way, we have a long way to go. It's clear that we need a united national voice, bridging the tremendous diversity within Asian Pacific America, to both defend against anti-Asian attacks and to proactively set a course for the future."""

He spent 36 years at Time Warner, many of them as head of the company's corporate communications. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion articles at CNN. 
 (CNN)I was talking to a friend the other day about the pandemic, and we were musing about when we could end our isolation. Now that the world is beginning to reopen prematurely amid rising infection numbers, I have been thinking especially of those of us in our 60s and older. While the Covid-19 virus attacks all ages, we are among those at greatest risk.
What I realized is that we will not be back to normal for a long, long time. Others will venture out. My son (26) and daughter (22) will surely risk the threat of infection and try to resume some normalcy. But for older folks and those with pre-existing conditions, our isolation must be ongoing. We will be the last to resume activity and continue our lives.
And while we wait, we can hear the echoes of those who care little about our vulnerability. One example: As the virus swept across the US, a city official in Antioch, California, said Covid-19 should be allowed to run its course, even if elderly and homeless people die. Ken Turnage, chairman of the city's planning commission, posted on Facebook that the country needed to adopt a ""Herd Mentality"" that ""allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature."" 
Turnage, who later deleted the post, refused to resign or retract his comments and was removed from his role. But the remarks shook me.
Not everyone expresses themselves as callously as Turnage. Yet I'm equally appalled by those who've suggested the physically weak should be willing to sacrifice themselves for the future of the economy. Even Dr. Mehmet Oz seemed to incline to that view when in April he told Fox News that school re-openings were an ""appetizing opportunity"" because they ""may only cost us 2 to 3% in terms of total mortality."" He was citing an editorial in The Lancet that said studies had shown school closures alone would reduce Covid-19 deaths in the UK by only 2 to 4 percent according to the New York Times. Oz has since said he ""misspoke,"" but that's little comfort for me, a member of the vulnerable older demographic -- disproportionately dying from the disease who would be sacrificed because of an impatience felt by some to ""open up.""
The term ""culling of the herd"" is a euphemism for a dark strategy to kick-start an economy severely damaged by lockdowns. It also feels like a nice way of saying that my older friends and I could (and some believe should) be allowed to die. Translated, that means we are like bovines who have bad meat and thus should be expendable to save all the other tasty cows and bulls. 
The phrase is chilling. And there is another ugly rancher-influenced turn of phrase that is equally scary to me and my boomer cohorts. It's ""herd immunity."" 
Herd immunity occurs when a high proportion of the population -- an estimated 70% for Covid-19 -- has developed immunity after exposure to the virus, or through vaccination and the protection, somewhat, of the part of the population that is not immune. The problem with allowing the virus to run rampant to achieve that, however, is that allowing that many exposures could also lead to countless complications and deaths worldwide -- especially among the most vulnerable. 
The herd immunity idea was a strategy of the Swedish government to neutralize Covid-19. In the early stage of the pandemic, the concept was also floated by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a way to reduce transmission.
Both governments have since tempered their support for the strategy. But that hasn't stopped the topic from permeating social media. 
As for ""culling,"" this has several meanings. Culling fruits means throwing out damaged pieces before the quality ones are shipped to the store -- or thinning fruit trees to maximize their crops. Culling in terms of animal populations humans, for instance entails hunting or slaughtering the weaker or sick animals to reduce herd numbers. 
It feels like I'm starting to see that word more and more on social media. But for people like me, letting the virus run rampant in the hope of building herd immunity is scary and cruel. 
The country is clearly divided. Many of the pro-Trump base are treating a potentially lethal virus not as science but as a political concoction of the left. Some also don't believe in wearing masks and reject social distancing. 
In a society that has always honored and been oddly enamored of youth and the young, it is not surprising that older folks are deemed disposable by some. But I'm in my 60s and I'm still vibrant. I enjoy working with clients to help them achieve their goals. I'd like to be around to see my kids' marriages and continue to help mentor their careers. I want to hold grandchildren and play with Walter, my grand-dog. 
The folks who are my age and older will be more vulnerable to exposure as society re-opens. College and school students could spread the virus even as they are better able to shake it off. For us, our pre-lockdown pleasures will be a distant memory while we feel our only option is to stay inside and pray for a cure. A doctor friend of mine says it is simply Darwinism and that only the strong will survive. A religious friend says it is biblical. 
I'm not expecting to be able to return to the New York City that I love for its energy, its museums, and because I was born here and raised my children here. Without any treatment or vaccine, I fear that, as activity returns, I will only be able to wait in my apartment and go out alone in a disinfected elevator so I can walk around the block.
We must be aware that this might be the next phase in our nightmare. Other societies honor their elders. Ours needs to stop using callous phrases about culling them."

The race was originally scheduled for Sept. 26-27 but organisers had already said it could not go ahead then because of Germany’s ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until Oct. 24. 
The event is one of a group of leading marathons that also includes Tokyo, Boston, London, Chicago and New York. To date, 11 world records have been set over the streets of the German capital. 
New York on Wednesday also announced the cancellation of the world’s largest marathon on Nov. 1 due to the pandemic. 
“Over the past weeks, we have put a lot of commitment and effort into examining all options for holding the BMW Berlin-Marathon 2020 under the given conditions,” Berlin organisers said in a statement. 
“We worked hard on the development of a hygiene concept and held countless discussions with our experts, the responsible authorities and service providers, among others.” 
The statement said a comprehensive feasibility analysis showed, however, that the marathon could not be held at a later date this year either. 
Weather conditions and shorter days would make it difficult and there was also uncertainty about the regulations after October. 
“The question of whether athletes will be able to travel internationally again by then can also not yet be answered,” said Juergen Lock, managing director of SCC Events. 
Participants will be offered a choice of repayment of the entry fee or a place in next year’s event.

The news comes a day after the NBA began Phase 2 of its return-to-play plan, during which time players are required to be tested for coronavirus. 
Hield, the Kings’ second-leading scorer at 19.8 points per game, played in 82 games last season and didn’t miss a game this season prior to the league’s shutdown due to the virus. He is one of Sacramento’s key players, having averaged 20.3 points and 41.1 percent 3-point shooting since the start of last season. He also won the league’s 3-point contest during All-Star weekend back in February. 
Though neither the team nor Hield confirmed the report, Hield was seen on video earlier this month playing in an adult league in Oklahoma with a gym full of fans. 
As for Parker, he said in a statement, “Several days ago I tested positive for COVID-19 and immediately self-isolated in Chicago which is where I remain. I am progressing in my recovery and feeling well. I look forward to joining my teammates in Orlando as we return to the court for the resumption of the NBA season.” 
Parker, 25, is with his fifth team in the past three seasons. Earlier this season, he played 32 games for the Atlanta Hawks, making 23 starts and averaging 15 points and six rebounds. 
The Hawks traded Parker and center Alex Len to the Kings on Feb. 6 in exchange for center Dewayne Dedmon and two second-round draft picks. Parker appeared in just one game for his new team, finishing with four points and four rebounds against the Grizzlies on Feb. 20. He sat out Sacramento’s last nine games before the NBA season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Kings are among the six NBA teams currently outside of a playoff position who will join the 16 currently in postseason positions when the league assembles in early July near Orlando, Fla. 
The 22 invited teams will each play eight regular-season games ahead of the postseason, which could include play-in games for the last spot in each conference depending upon how close the ninth-place teams are. 
Sacramento (28-36) is 3 1/2 games behind the eighth-place Memphis Grizzlies (32-33) in the Western Conference standings."

The new equity will help boost its liquidity to about 3 billion pounds, easyJet said on Thursday, enabling it to survive for many more months even if planes are grounded again, and putting it in a strong position to cope with “protracted recovery scenarios”. 
EasyJet’s planes returned to the air in mid-June, but with a minimal service as lockdowns to contain the pandemic were gradually eased. The airline is hoping to ramp up flying as the year goes on, but demand is being hampered by UK quarantine rules and consumer nervousness. 
Airlines are hoping Britain agrees travel deals with other countries to allow restriction-free movement between some European countries. An announcement could come on or before the quarantine rules are reviewed on June 29. 
EasyJet said it had placed a total of 59.5 million new ordinary shares at 703 pence apiece, after announcing the move late Wednesday. 
Its shares fell 5.4% to 699 pence in early Thursday trading. They have approximately halved in value since the start of the year. 
EasyJet has said it does not expect passenger demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 and is planning to axe up to 4,500 jobs. 
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said the airline was already making progress with cost cutting. 
“EasyJet has a compelling proposition of lower cost structures and strong positions in better markets. For investors looking to buy into the recovery in Europe, easyJet should be on the shopping list,” he said in a note. 
British Airways, owned by IAG (ICAG.L), has said it needs to shed 12,000 jobs and there has been media speculation that IAG could also raise new equity.

“The demand exceeds our production,” Christoph Franz was quoted as saying in Saturday’s paper. The decision on where tests were shipped to depended, among other things, on infection rates and the availability of diagnostic equipment. 
Demand for its antibody tests, which determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, can be met as Roche has been boosting production, he said. 
The drugmaker has said that it aims to more than double production of antibody tests to well over 100 million a month by the end of the year. 
Franz said that Roche had started research on a potential drug to treat COVID-19 but added that these efforts were at a very early stage.

The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated economic problems that worsened after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 from Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions. On Monday, Iran’s rial currency fell to its lowest ever level against the U.S. dollar. 
“It’s been the most difficult year due to the enemy’s economic pressure and the pandemic,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.  
“The economic pressure that began in 2018 has increased ... and today it is the toughest pressure on our dear country.” 
Iran has seen a sharp increase in coronavirus infections and deaths since restrictions to stem the spread of the pandemic were gradually lifted from mid-April. The death toll has recently topped 100 a day for the first time in two months. 
More than 220,000 cases have been confirmed, and over 10,000 deaths. 
Rouhani said wearing of masks will become mandatory for two weeks starting next Sunday in “gathering places” that are deemed “red spots”. 
Senior officials have regularly warned that restrictions will be reimposed if health regulations such as social distancing to stem the surge in infections are not observed. 
Iran launched a campaign on Saturday to motivate a reluctant public to use face masks.

Standard &amp; Poor cut its rating on the world’s biggest cruise operator’s secured bonds to ‘BB+’ from ‘BBB-‘, and its unsecured bonds to ‘BB-‘ from ‘BBB-‘. Both are now regarded as non-investment grade or junk bonds. 
Carnival’s overall issuer credit rating was also lowered to ‘BB-‘ from ‘BBB-‘. Last month, Moody’s Investors Service also cut the company’s rating to junk status. 
Earlier in June, Carnival reported record $4.4 billion in preliminary quarterly losses after its business was crippled by the health crisis, forcing it to take major write-downs on the disposal of some docked ships. 
The company, which in recent weeks fully drew down a $3 billion credit line and issued $6.6 billion in bonds and equity, has also been looking for further waivers on debt repayments due next year, without which it could breach some loan conditions.

FIFA’s plan means world soccer’s governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits. 
FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its ‘Forward’ projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women’s football. 
The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a ‘universal solidarity grant’ of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women’s football. 
Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million. 
FA’s will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million. 
“Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions. 
Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds. 
The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations’ desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches. 
Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America. 
The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a ‘test event’ for the 2022 World Cup. 
The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only. 
The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar’s World Cup organising committee.

“Any player who tested positive will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols for discontinuing isolation and has been cleared by a physician,” the National Basketball Association said in a statement. 
The 16 positive tests were out of 302 players tested on June 23. The league did not disclose the identities of the players. 
Jabari Parker and Alex Len of the Sacramento Kings and Indiana Pacers’ Malcolm Brogdon were confirmed on Wednesday to have tested positive, though it was not immediately clear when their tests took place. 
Kings forward Parker said in a team statement that he had received the diagnosis “several days ago.” 
The NBA is tentatively set to restart its suspended season on July 31 at Disney World in Florida, with players living, practicing and playing at the resort to minimize the risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus. 
Under the plan, 22 of the NBA’s 30 teams will play eight seeding games to determine a 16-team playoff field that would follow the traditional post-season format and crown a champion in October.

By Wednesday, more than 7,000 people had signed the petition, which was created by Katie Belisle, a Disney World Attractions hostess, and addressed to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. 
“This virus is not gone, unfortunately it’s only become worse in this state,” the petition says. “Having our theme parks remain closed until cases are steadily decreasing would keep our guests, our employees and their families safe.” 
Belisle could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) parks have been closed since January to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company had estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March. 
“The safety and wellbeing of our cast members and guests are at the forefront of our planning, and we are in active dialogue with our unions on the extensive health and safety protocols, following guidance from public health experts, which we plan to implement as we move toward our proposed, phased reopening,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. 
The Florida petition follows similar pushback from unions representing workers at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which is planning to reopen on July 17. In a June 18 letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, the unions said it is still unsafe to open the park. Over 49,500 people have signed a Change.org petition urging Disney to reopen the park at a later date. 
Disney has already reopened its Shanghai Disneyland theme park and has partially reopened its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping complex. Disneyland Paris will begin a phased reopening on July 15. 
When Disney World reopens, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time.

Official travel advice against all but essential travel outside Britain will also be eased for some countries and regions. 
Taken together, these changes will make it easier for Britons to travel abroad for summer holidays. 
The relaxations are the latest taken by the government to unwind emergency measures put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, as ministers look to limit the economic damage caused by the virus. 
An expert panel will put nations into three categories: green, amber and red. Passengers arriving from green and amber countries will no longer have to quarantine themselves for 14 days after their arrival. 
“Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world,” a government spokeswoman said. “But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re-emerge.” 
The rules for red-category countries will not change. 
The quarantine policy, introduced on June 8, has been heavily criticised by airlines, airports and the hospitality sector who say it deters international travel at a time when they had been hoping for it to recover. 
The categories are due to be announced next week, with the rule changes expected to come into effect the week after. They will be based on factors including prevalence of COVID-19, the trajectory of the disease and the reliability of data. 
Britain said it is likely to discuss this with countries including France, Greece and Spain. 
The Foreign Office will next week announce those countries where it considers the public health risk is no longer unacceptably high.

The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated economic problems that worsened after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 from Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions. On Monday, Iran’s rial currency fell to its lowest ever level against the U.S. dollar. 
“It’s been the most difficult year due to the enemy’s economic pressure and the pandemic,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.  
“The economic pressure that began in 2018 has increased ... and today it is the toughest pressure on our dear country.” 
Iran has seen a sharp increase in coronavirus infections and deaths since restrictions to stem the spread of the pandemic were gradually lifted from mid-April. The death toll has recently topped 100 a day for the first time in two months. 
More than 220,000 cases have been confirmed, and over 10,000 deaths. 
Rouhani said wearing of masks will become mandatory for two weeks starting next Sunday in “gathering places” that are deemed “red spots”. 
Senior officials have regularly warned that restrictions will be reimposed if health regulations such as social distancing to stem the surge in infections are not observed. 
Iran launched a campaign on Saturday to motivate a reluctant public to use face masks.

The benchmark Nikkei average closed 0.07% lower at 22,534.32, with 59 advancers against 163 decliners. 
Earlier in the session, Tokyo markets tracked overnight gains in Wall Street as improving economic data and the prospect of more stimulus bolstered hopes of a swift recovery. 
The pace of contraction in the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors eased in June with reopening of businesses. While new home sales jumped 16.6% in May, blowing past estimates of a 2.9% rise. 
However, an increase in Tokyo’s coronavirus infections on Wednesday lifted the risk-averse sentiment.

Producing enough to end the pandemic will be the biggest medical manufacturing feat in history. 
That work is underway. 
From deploying experts amid global travel restrictions to managing extreme storage conditions, and even inventing new kinds of vials and syringes for billions of doses, the path is strewn with formidable hurdles, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen vaccine developers and their backers. 
Any hitch in an untested supply chain - which could stretch from Pune in India to England’s Oxford and Baltimore in the United States - could torpedo or delay the complex process. 
Col. Nelson Michael, director of the U.S. Army’s Center for Infectious Disease Research who is working on the government’s “Warp Speed” project to deliver a vaccine at scale by January, said companies usually have years to figure this stuff out. 
“Now, they have weeks.” 
Much of the world’s attention is focused on the scientific race to develop a vaccine. But behind the scenes, experts are facing a stark reality: we may simply not have enough capacity to make, package and distribute billions of doses all at once. 
Companies and governments are racing to scale-up machinery to address a critical shortage in automated filling and finishing capacity - the final step in the manufacturing process of putting the vaccine into vials or syringes, sealing them and packaging them up for shipping. 
“This is the biggest logistical challenge the world has ever faced,” said Toby Peters, an engineering and technology expert at Britain’s Birmingham university. “We could be looking at vaccinating 60% of the population.” 
Several developers, including frontrunner Moderna (MRNA.O), are experimenting with new ways to mitigate the extreme cold storage demands of their vaccines, which at present need to be kept at minus 80 degrees Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit). 
SiO2 Materials Science is working on producing vials that won’t shatter at super-cold temperatures. 
Travel restrictions, meanwhile, are posing more prosaic problems; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N), which plans to start clinical trials this summer, has struggled to send its vaccine experts to oversee the launch of production sites, for example. 
‘NEVER IN HISTORY’ 
By setting up massive clinical trials involving 10,000 to 30,000 volunteers per vaccine, scientists hope to get an answer on whether a vaccine works as early as this October. But even if they succeed, manufacturing in bulk, getting regulators to sign off and packaging billions of doses is a monumental challenge. 
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance, said in reality, the world is unlikely to go straight from having zero vaccines to having enough doses for everyone. 
“It’s likely to be a tailored approach to start with,” he said in an interview. “We’re looking to have something like one to two billion doses of vaccine in the first year, spread out over the world population.” 
J&amp;J has partnered with the U.S. government on a $1 billion investment to speed development and production of its vaccine, even before it’s proven to work. It has contracted Emergent Biosolutions and Catalent to manufacture in bulk in the United States. Catalent will also do some fill-and-finish work. 
“Never in history has so much vaccine been developed at the same time - so that capacity doesn’t exist,” said Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J’s chief scientific officer, who sees filling capacity as the main limiting factor. 
Emergent’s (EBS.N) manufacturing plant in Bayview, Maryland, can accommodate four vaccines in parallel using different manufacturing platforms and equipment. 
Funded by the government in 2012, the plant includes single-use disposable bioreactor equipment featuring plastic bags rather than stainless steel fermentation equipment, which makes it easier to switch from one vaccine to another. 
This month, the company received an additional $628 million to make those four suites available to support any candidate the government selects, CEO Bob Kramer told Reuters. 
BLOW-FILL-SEAL-REPEAT 
As well as working with J&amp;J, New Jersey-based Catalent (CTLT.N) signed a deal with British drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) last week to provide vial-filling and packaging services at its plant in Anagni, Italy. It aims to handle hundreds of millions of doses, starting as early as August 2020 and possibly running through until March 2022. 
It has ordered high-speed vial-filling equipment to boost output at its Indiana plant, where it is also hiring an additional 300 workers. 
Michael Riley, Catalent’s North American president for biologics, told Reuters his biggest challenge was trying to compress work that normally takes years into months. 
Adding to the challenge is that glass vials are in short supply. 
To save glass, companies plan to use larger vials of five to 20 doses - but this raises new problems, such as potential waste, if not all the doses are used before the vaccine spoils. 
“The downside is that after a healthcare practitioner opens a vial, they need to then vaccinate 20 people in a short, 24-hour time,” said Prashant Yadav, a global healthcare supply-chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington. 
As part of the same drive, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense have awarded ApiJect Systems up to $138 million to upgrade its facilities to be able to make up to 100 million plastic pre-filled syringes by the end of this year, and as many as 600 million in 2021. 
The company plans to use a technology called Blow-Fill-Seal, where syringes are blown out of plastic, filled with vaccine and sealed in seconds. This will need Food and Drug Administration approval, CEO Jay Walker told Reuters. 
BREAKING COLD CHAIN 
SiO2 Materials Science is, meanwhile, ramping up capacity of plastic vials with a glass lining, which are more stable at ultra-low temperatures. 
“You can bring us down to minus 196 Celsius, which none of the vaccines need,” Chief Business Officer Lawrence Ganti said. “You can throw it against the wall and it doesn’t break. Our founder has done that. He’s thrown frozen vials at me.” 
The company expects to boost production from the current 5-10 million vials a year to 120 million within three-and-a-half months, he told Reuters. 
Once packaged, many vaccines need to be kept cold - and some leading contenders made from genetic material such as messenger RNA need to be kept very cold - presenting another challenge that may limit access. 
“People who work with mRNA store it at minus 80 degrees centigrade, which is not something you’re gonna find in most pharmacies or doctor’s offices,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. 
Peters of Birmingham university has been gathering data from poorer regions of Africa and Asia, and said breaks in the temperature-controlled supply chain - “cold chain” - are already frequent. 
In some places, it is common to lose 25% or more of vaccines because of broken cold chains, he told Reuters. 
“So if you’re looking to manufacture four billion, and you reckon you’re going to lose 25%, then you have to manufacture five billion,” he said. “It’s all the elements to move it from the point of manufacture to the point of aggregation, right down to the health centres and then out to the community.” 
QUARANTINE QUAGMIRE 
Companies developing mRNA vaccines, including Moderna and Translate Bio, which is partnering with Sanofi (SASY.PA), are working to make candidates stable at higher temperatures. 
Ron Renaud, CEO of Translate Bio, said he was confident this would happen “within a short amount of time”. 
Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman, said: “We are getting more confident that we could run our supply chain at -20C, which is an easier storage condition than deep freezing,” she said. 
Moderna plans to add a small period of time in which the vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius in doctors’ offices or clinics. 
“We will know more in the next 2-3 months,” she said. 
The pandemic is also presenting obstacles of a less technical nature. 
Catalent, which has some 30 plants globally, has had to write special permission slips in eight languages explaining that their workers are considered essential. 
J&amp;J is having trouble getting experienced personnel to far-flung labs to oversee the transfer of technology to contract manufacturers because they’re subject to 14-day quarantines. 
“It is absolutely a factor,” said Stoffels. “If you have to send your people to the middle of India to get to filling capacity, that’s not easy at the moment.”

By Wednesday, more than 7,000 people had signed the petition, which was created by Katie Belisle, a Disney World Attractions hostess, and addressed to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. 
“This virus is not gone, unfortunately it’s only become worse in this state,” the petition says. “Having our theme parks remain closed until cases are steadily decreasing would keep our guests, our employees and their families safe.” 
Belisle could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Walt Disney Co parks have been closed since January to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company had estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March. 
“The safety and wellbeing of our cast members and guests are at the forefront of our planning, and we are in active dialogue with our unions on the extensive health and safety protocols, following guidance from public health experts, which we plan to implement as we move toward our proposed, phased reopening,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. 
The Florida petition follows similar pushback from unions representing workers at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which is planning to reopen on July 17. In a June 18 letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, the unions said it is still unsafe to open the park. Over 49,500 people have signed a Change.org petition urging Disney to reopen the park at a later date. 
Disney has already reopened its Shanghai Disneyland theme park and has partially reopened its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping complex. Disneyland Paris will begin a phased reopening on July 15. 
When Disney World reopens, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time.

The organisers also confirmed the meeting at Gateshead in England, which was scheduled for Aug. 16, has been postponed. 
“Following the latest government announcements on the organisation of major events in France, meeting organisers concluded that there is not enough time to organise a world-class international event in the French capital this year,” the Diamond League said in a statement. 
The event in Eugene, which was originally scheduled for Oct. 6, was scrapped as the state of Oregon currently has a ban of gatherings, including sporting events until at least the end of September. 
“The ban, combined with the expected long term restrictions on international travel, make it impossible to host a world class track &amp; field meet,” the statement said. 
The Diamond League has identified Sept. 12 as a possible alternate date for the Gateshead meeting but must wait before announcing confirmation due to British government guidelines and restrictions. 
Due to the growing number of countries affected by the COVID-19 virus, the Diamond League season could not start as planned in Doha on April 17. 
Meetings have been since cancelled in London, Rabat and Zurich - which was originally scheduled to host the season finale in September - while other events on the calendar were postponed due to the pandemic. 
British Athletics announced on Friday that the British Athletics Championships will take place on Sept. 4-5 behind closed doors at the Manchester Regional Arena.

<ul>
<li>Some news outlets reported that children cannot transmit COVID-19, based on a recently published review of 78 previous COVID-19 studies. </li>
<li>One of the researchers issued a statement clarifying that children ""almost certainly do transmit …",https://www.businessinsider.com/children-do-transmit-covid-19-says-researcher-amid-confusion-2020-4,https://i.insider.com/5eab12cee3c3fb7cdd2de16b?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-04-30T19:47:00Z,"As governments weigh the costs and benefits of lifting lockdowns, a debate over just how vulnerable children are to COVID-19 is emerging. 
Switzerland's infectious diseases chief declared this week that children under the age of 10 ""don't have the receptors to catch the disease,"" and the country is reopening its public schools on May 11. 
On Thursday, the picture was further muddied by coverage of a large review of 78 available studies conducted by the UK Royal College of Paediatrics, which said: ""The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role."" 
The first articles to cover the review said there was no evidence to date that any children had passed the virus on to adults.
But one of the researchers that authored the review in question, Alasdair Munro, insists their findings were misunderstood, and that children can indeed pass the virus to adults. 
Getty
""Children almost certainly DO transmit COVID-19,"" Munro, a clinical research fellow in pediatric infectious diseases at University Hospital Southampton, said on Twitter on Thursday, adding: ""Growing evidence suggests children are less susceptible to infection, have milder infection, and are infrequently responsible for household transmission.""
The Royal College of Pediatrics also corrected the record, tweeting that ""a number of media reports, citing RCPCH, have incorrectly suggested that children cannot transmit COVID-19. This is not the the RCPCH position, nor is it based on evidence.""
The confusion stemmed, in part, from a reference in the review to a study by the China/WHO joint commission. People interviewed by members of the commission could not recall a single episode where a child transmitted the disease to an adult.

Something is loading.
However, the review also states: ""Evidence that [children] are not a reservoir of disease does not exist.""
The evidence shows children are less likely to get seriously ill with COVID-19
The evidence shows that children are far less likely to get gravely ill with COVID-19, and the death rate among children is low.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1.7% of 150,000 American COVID-19 cases affected people under the age of 18. Globally the amount of children with COVID-19 is under 2% of all cases, from Korea to Spain to Italy.
In Iceland, where 6% of the population was tested, none of the 848 children tested were positive. In a town in Italy where 2.6% of residents had the new coronavirus, 0% of children under 10 years tested positive.
Another study of 2,000 children with COVID-19 in China found that 90% of them were asymptomatic, 39% developed pneumonia without symptoms, and 6% of children developed severe infections.
Experts warn there is nowhere near enough evidence to feel confident that children don't spread the virus
SARS was another respiratory disease that also affected adults more than children. ""Transmission of SARS from pediatric patients appears to be uncommon but is possible,"" wrote the authors of a 2006 study.
However, German virologist Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin's Charite hospital, urged policymakers to exercise caution when looking at studies examining the effects of COVID-19 on children. He pointed out that the findings of a Dutch study, which was used as evidence that children do not play a big role in spreading COVID-19, were not statistically significant.
According to his own research, Drosten said, children can carry as high levels of the coronavirus as adults. He and his colleagues warned ""against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation.""
In an April 29 press conference, World Health Organization technical lead Maria van Kerkhove doubled down on warnings against seeing children as immune, or unable to pass on the virus. 
""There's no reason to think that children are less susceptible to infection if they're exposed, and that they can't transmit,"" she said. ""We're really not seeing this in the epidemiology."""

The Ashgabat government has repeatedly said the desert nation of 6 million is free of the novel coronavirus. It has imposed quarantine for those flying in from abroad, closed land border crossings and curbed travel between provinces. 
“While there are no official reports of positive COVID-19 cases in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Embassy has received reports of local citizens with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 undergoing COVID-19 testing and being placed in quarantine in infectious diseases hospitals for up to fourteen days,” the embassy said in the alert message posted on its website. 
“Private citizens who undergo testing for COVID-19 in Turkmenistan may be sent to involuntary quarantine at a government-selected facility at their own expense with no control over the amenities for an unspecified period of time.” 
The Turkmen foreign ministry said the U.S. embassy statement was distorting information about measures it has taken against the virus. 
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan points out the lack of substance and objectivity in this kind of ‘fake news’,” it said, adding that it had already warned the U.S. ambassador against spreading information “not supported by facts”. 
The gas-rich desert nation located north of Iran and Afghanistan is one of the world’s most tightly-controlled and isolated countries.

By Wednesday, more than 7,000 people had signed the petition, which was created by Katie Belisle, a Disney World Attractions hostess, and addressed to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. 
“This virus is not gone, unfortunately it’s only become worse in this state,” the petition says. “Having our theme parks remain closed until cases are steadily decreasing would keep our guests, our employees and their families safe.” 
Belisle could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) parks have been closed since January to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company had estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March. 
“The safety and wellbeing of our cast members and guests are at the forefront of our planning, and we are in active dialogue with our unions on the extensive health and safety protocols, following guidance from public health experts, which we plan to implement as we move toward our proposed, phased reopening,” a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. 
The Florida petition follows similar pushback from unions representing workers at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which is planning to reopen on July 17. In a June 18 letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, the unions said it is still unsafe to open the park. Over 49,500 people have signed a Change.org petition urging Disney to reopen the park at a later date. 
Disney has already reopened its Shanghai Disneyland theme park and has partially reopened its Disney Springs entertainment and shopping complex. Disneyland Paris will begin a phased reopening on July 15. 
When Disney World reopens, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time.

The race was originally scheduled for Sept. 26-27 but organisers had already said it could not go ahead then because of Germany’s ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until Oct. 24. 
The event is one of a group of leading marathons that also includes Tokyo, Boston, London, Chicago and New York. To date, 11 world records have been set over the streets of the German capital. 
New York on Wednesday also announced the cancellation of the world’s largest marathon on Nov. 1 due to the pandemic. 
“Over the past weeks, we have put a lot of commitment and effort into examining all options for holding the BMW Berlin-Marathon 2020 under the given conditions,” Berlin organisers said in a statement. 
“We worked hard on the development of a hygiene concept and held countless discussions with our experts, the responsible authorities and service providers, among others.” 
The statement said a comprehensive feasibility analysis showed, however, that the marathon could not be held at a later date this year either. 
Weather conditions and shorter days would make it difficult and there was also uncertainty about the regulations after October. 
“The question of whether athletes will be able to travel internationally again by then can also not yet be answered,” said Juergen Lock, managing director of SCC Events. 
Participants will be offered a choice of repayment of the entry fee or a place in next year’s event.

Champ, a two-times winner on the PGA Tour, is the second known member of the circuit to test positive for the novel coronavirus following fellow American golfer Nick Watney’s positive test last Friday. 
“I feel great physically and I was obviously surprised and disappointed to learn of the test result,” Champ said in a PGA Tour news release. “It’s important now to take the necessary steps and measures to protect others, including my loved ones.” 
The PGA Tour said it is expected to release full testing results at the completion of the pre-tournament testing process on Wednesday. 
This week’s Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is the third of five events on the PGA Tour’s revamped schedule that is closed to the general public in a bid to help stem the spread of the virus. 
According to a PGA Tour participant resource guide, anyone who tests positive will be quarantined while a “disinfecting/decontaminating response” is implemented. 
The guide also said at-home tests before traveling to a tournament are “strongly encouraged” but not required. 
Upon arriving at a tournament, all players and caddies must proceed to a testing site to receive a nasal swab test and thermal screening. 
Only once a negative test result is received, will players be issued a wristband or lanyard that grants them access to the locker room and clubhouse.

Tesla has applied for a license to become a UK energy provider 
The company may bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain.
Tesla has reportedly applied for a license to become an energy provider in the UK. That means it might bring its PowerPack battery technology to Britain, much as it did with its 100-megawatt installation in South Australia. It may also be a way for the company to introduce a platform called Autobidder, which allows renewable power suppliers to trade energy.
The company hasn’t confirmed any plans for large-scale PowerPacks in the UK, but the country generates 40 percent of its energy from renewables, including wind and solar, which means the system would make sense, smoothing out gaps in renewable energy production. 
Tesla could also deploy its new platform, Autobidder, which uses machine-learning tech and cloud platforms to optimize power distribution. It’s a dry topic but could make power production more efficient. Continue reading.

Juul may exit France, Spain and other European markets
It reportedly has nothing to do with COVID-19.
Juul is preparing to leave five European countries within the year.  Unlike all the shutdowns and layoffs reported over the past months, BuzzFeed’s source says the decision didn’t have anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic.
The e-cigarette maker is reportedly planning to pull out of Austria, Belgium, Portugal and Spain in July, followed by France at the end of the year. Juul enjoys relatively high sales in Spain and France compared to the rest of the continent, but not high enough to justify the costs and the trouble of dealing with regulators. The European Union has stringent requirements when it comes to e-cigarette products, as the publication notes, requiring companies to stick to a nicotine limit of 20 milligrams per milliliter of fluid. Meanwhile, in the US, a single Juul pod can contain up to 59 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter. Continue reading.

Once the A100 is installed in Argonne, researchers there will “be able to screen 1 billion drugs in under 24 hours,” Kimberly Powell, Vice President of Healthcare at NVIDIA, told reporters in a briefing. Without the added computing power, researchers would need close to a year to screen the same number of therapeutics.
“This supercomputer is going to combine both accelerated computing and artificial intelligence,” Powell continued. “Critical applications in molecular dynamics simulation, where you can understand how molecules interact with drugs, how to interfere with the virus protein binds to the cell protein and how to block it with a molecule. And then how can we screen as many drugs as possible so we can more quickly get that drug candidate into experimentation and into clinical trials.” Up to 140 A100s can be run in parallel, pooling the combined power of their GPUs into a “DGX SuperPOD” that boasts more than 700 petaflops of processing capability. 
NVIDIA also announced a host of other new services it plans to roll out to hospitals across the country. Using its line of Clara Parabrick GPUs, NVIDIA has managed to reduce the time needed to analyze an entire human genome from around 30 hours to less than 20 minutes. The company is also teaming with more than a dozen industry partners and 50 hospitals around the globe to help better protect frontline medical staff through the use of remote monitoring, video conferencing and at-a-distance body temperature monitoring in a program called NVIDIA Clara Guardian."

Whatever we were used to, in terms of cost, convenience and experience, it’s not going to be the same for a while. Just last week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said that only 45 percent of travelers asked intended to fly “within a few months of the pandemic subsiding.”
Perhaps the biggest casualty of COVID-19 so far has been the Airbus A380 and the flying it represented. This “superjumbo” jet, competition for the Boeing 747, was designed to offer mass transit in the skies, to convey huge volumes of people around the world in its double-decker cabin and a potential capacity of more than 850.
Work on the A380 began in the early ‘90s, with the first vessel entering service in 2007, and it’s instantly recognizable. Less a plane and more like a bus, it hauls people between major hub airports, where they get a single-aisle craft to their destination. The idea of air travel, back at the A380’s genesis, was that you’d fly to, say, JFK, and then get an A380 to Cape Town, Paris or Shanghai.
A number of carriers have A380s, but it’s become synonymous with Emirates, which has a staggering 115 of the craft in its fleet. But despite the plane’s relative youth, launching just over a decade ago, the virus has hastened the A380’s demise. Airbus announced last year it would stop manufacturing the plane, and according to Bloomberg, even Emirates, its biggest booster, no longer wants its remaining deliveries. 
Other carriers are also swinging the axe on their A380s, including Air France-KLM, which brought forward the “definitive end” of A380 operations by two years. In a statement, the airline said that doing so would make its fleet more competitive, with a “significantly reduced environmental footprint.” In its place would be smaller planes, like Airbus A350s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. 
Business Traveler said that Lufthansa is speeding up the phase-out of its own A380s, reducing its fleet of the superjumbo by half. Qantas, similarly, has said it will use smaller single-aisle planes on its long-haul routes until at least September — with eight of its 10 A380s grounded until then. 
From an airworthiness perspective, the A380’s retirement is premature — very premature. For comparison, a Boeing document from 2013 says the operational lifespan of its commercial aircraft is around 30 years. AerSale, a company offering aftermarket support for planes, says that “from purchase to retirement,” a plane should last “between 20 and 36 years.” If the A380 disappears from the skies by 2022, it will have lived — in total — for not even half of its potential lifespan. 
The problem with the A380 is that Airbus had banked on a “hub and spoke” model for international travel, but failed to spot the flaw in that plan. Taking a short hop to a hub airport and then on to another on the other side of the world will always add hours to a journey. It’s something that rival Boeing did pick up on. And it went in the opposite direction. 
Back in 2002, Boeing’s Peter Rumsey, then head of new airplane development, wrote that passengers “demonstrated a preference for flights that take less time.” He added that it was “common sense” to take people “where they want to go,” and what passengers wanted more than anything else was more direct flights.
At the time, Rumsey was hyping Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser concept, a new plane with a delta wing formation that would cruise at Mach 0.95 (around 729MPH). The Sonic Cruiser would fly higher than existing planes, with reduced turbulence and faster speeds. And, crucially, rather than trying to build a plane to cater for 800-plus passengers, Boeing’s Sonic Cruiser would transport between 200 and 250. 
The Sonic Cruiser project did not survive, with a post-9/11 slump causing interest in the project to dry up. But its original spirit, and some of the ideas, trickled down to Boeing’s next big, albeit far less radical, new aircraft: the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 is made of lightweight composite materials, has a higher internal pressure (for passenger comfort) and is far cheaper to run than similarly sized rivals.
The A380 had other problems, too. Its sheer size meant that airports had to make special alterations to their gates to accommodate such a plane. It also meant that it required larger crews and more engines, increasing the cost of each flight. One Forbes report said that every hour the A380 was in flight cost between $26,000 and $29,000. A Dreamliner, by comparison, costs closer to $11,000 an hour to fly.
Airlines will likely replace the A380 with smaller aircraft from Airbus and Boeing to reduce emissions and to deal with a drop in expected passenger numbers. What we won’t see, in the eyes of at least one aviation expert, is news of a next-generation airplane in the near future. 
Bill Blain is a market strategist at Shard Capital with a focus on the business of flying. He feels the aviation industry has badly misjudged the market. “It’s a right bloody mess,” he said, with both companies obsessing over making bigger, more capacious aircraft. Blain said that, while the Dreamliner is a “wonderful plane,” a better bet would have been a smaller plane.
He believes that airlines were always going to want planes closer to the 737 — a narrow-body plane with a capacity around 200 — than the bigger 747. “If you [as an airline] can get a small plane that you can make economical with 200 people on board,” then you’re golden. Blain said that Boeing’s failure to properly replace the 737 with a brand new aircraft has led to tragedy. The 737 Max, which modified the existing 737 design, led to two crashes that claimed 346 lives.
Airlines will need to pay for these early retirements, but Blain said they can’t simply raise ticket prices. The post-COVID economy is likely to be in recession or at least stricken enough that money is tight for everyone. “There’s not going to be the money available [in the economy] to hike airline prices, and airlines need bums on seats,” he said. 
What’s missing, however, is a next-generation advance that could really move the aviation market forward. Blain said the planes airlines will buy, like Airbus’ A320/321 and Boeing’s 737 Max, use “old tech” and aren’t very fuel efficient, both things airlines crave. He adds that both companies have neglected to invest in training new engineers to replace the experienced ones who are reaching retirement age. 
Airbus and Boeing declined to comment for this story, but both companies have new aircraft in the works. The latter is working on a “New Midsize Airplane,” which will reportedly seat between 220 and 270 passengers. However, Reuters reported in April that the program halted while the company scrambles to fix the 737 Max debacle.
Airbus’ next-generation craft could have been the hybrid-electric E-Fan X, co-developed with Rolls Royce. But that initiative died in April, a year before the aircraft was expected to take to the skies. The company is also working on a delta-wing concept, MAVERIC, with a bigger cabin but with a 20 percent reduction in fuel burn. But that won’t be ready for decades, if ever, and there’s still a need for aircraft that can ride the rough skies that COVID leaves behind."

When players arrive to Disney World’s “Life inside the Bubble” — tentative date July 30 — to restart the NBA basketball season, they’ll be met with a buffet of futuristic gadgets they can voluntarily use to prevent and detect the deadly coronavirus.
These gadgets include wearable proximity alarms that beep when you’ve been within six feet of someone too long, pulse oximeters, thermometers, and that hot $300 titanium smart ring everyone’s talking about, the Oura. The ring tracks and analyses data like sleep, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory function, and more. The NBA reportedly bought over 1,000 Oura rings for the season restart.
Players will also have plentiful at-will testing, too, making them the envy of most Americans.
Yet it’s Oura in all the headlines, the sci-fi wearable everyone suddenly wants. The ring’s hype in press is that it detects coronavirus symptoms up to three days in advance with 90 percent accuracy. That claim comes from a May press release basically promoting an app made by Oura, The West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI), and WVU Medicine. The app came out of a study between Oura and RNI about the ring’s potential to predict coronavirus among front-line healthcare workers. It’s a pretty cool idea, but my point is that it’s the app making the claim, and not necessarily the ring.
Oura, to its credit, has also been partnering with other teams at the forefront of COVID-19 research, like the USCF TemPredict study.
There are so many caveats here. For one, these studies are funded by the company selling the product. You could play buzzword bingo with every Oura press release until your eyes cross. Plus all the questions people like me have about Oura’s technical implementation and security implications (especially regarding Bluetooth), false positives, what Oura means by data sharing for in-app advertising, why they seemed to let their Android app languish, is it watching us masturbate like Ceiling Cat, and just how buggy is this magical wearable anyway? And, of course, what they think about making one for poor people. Because thanks to COVID-19, we’re going to have a lot more of those, too.
So we have questions. Lots of them. But we’re also really, truly in a life or death situation. So the deeper question is, are wearables finally getting to the point where they could detect COVID-19 symptoms before they appear (or provide a form of confirmation at the onset)?
Meet the biohacker who survived COVID-19
Biohacker Mikey Sklar had an unfortunate opportunity to find out for us when he contracted COVID-19 in the second week of March while using two fitness trackers: the Garmin Venu watch and Oura Ring.
“On the evening of March 16th, some anomalies started showing up even though I was not yet symptomatic,” Sklar wrote. “I would proceed to sweat through the night and wake up with a killer headache, terrible body aches, chills and a diminished sense of smell.” He then detailed some pretty obvious differences in his biometrics on the Garmin between his “normal” and “sick” states. 
His testing ordeal was intense, though Sklar told Engadget via email “Getting tested was more complicated at that time.”
If you use a sleep tracker like the Garmin or Oura, and you want to know what to look for regarding possible COVID-19 symptoms, Sklar noted his differences between “normal” and “sick” as: 
<ul><li>Resting Heart Rate increased by 15 BPM (lower is better)
</li><li>Heart Rate Variability decreased 30 BPM (higher is better)
</li><li>Average Overnight Body Temperature increased by 3.3 degrees fahrenheit
</li><li>Respiratory Rate increased by 2.7 breaths per minute
</li></ul>Sklar was one of the lucky ones. “My symptoms were limited and pretty much just being uncomfortable for a little over a week,” he wrote. Even so, he connected with developers of sleep app Bioloop, “who had been working with Stanford and Oura Ring data to find anomalies in a persons biometric history. They were looking for the same sort of jumps in biometrics I mentioned above RHR, HRV, body temperature and respiratory rate,” he added.
At the end of it all, Sklar concluded that “fitness trackers cannot tell us what we have,” but that they “can give us a little bit of warning when our bodies start fighting.” 
It’s a pretty even-handed take from someone who is really into hacking and tracking themselves. Some NBA players, on the other hand, are not cool with that at all. While using Oura rings is voluntary and the NBA is making data privacy promises to players, Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma tweeted, “Looks like a tracking device.”
A coronavirus panopticon (on your wrist)
Kuzma is right to be suspicious; he’s absolutely correct. Oura isn’t all that different than other sleep and wellness trackers, yet these devices gather and record a wealth of deeply personal data, they use security-problematic things like Bluetooth, anyone who knows what they’re doing can poke at the data to get more info like location, and companies get sold (as well as pressured by governments). 
From every technical perspective, something like the Oura represents an elite, thorough, and worryingly accurate tracking device bar none, terrifying if it were to be used for evil (or by Palantir, or Facebook for that matter). Moreso now that one country is taking coronavirus wearables in a very Orwellian direction — and that country is Singapore.
Not everyone in Singapore is using the country’s contact-tracing TraceTogether app. Use among the population never made it past 25% saturation, partly because not everyone has a smartphone, and largely because Singapore’s app doesn’t work on iPhones. That’s because TraceTogether breaks a serious security “best practice”, namely that Apple does not allow iPhone apps running in the background to access Bluetooth.
Singapore’s new solution to this mess of its own making is to release a wearable contact-tracing tracking device to its citizens and threaten to make it compulsory for the entire population to wear.
“Whether circumstances would ever require mandatory adoption we cannot say,” said Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative Minister-in-charge Vivian Balakrishnan on June 5th. “I am going to do my best to push participation rates up without having to go down the mandatory route.”
A petition was immediately created, with 52,000 signatures as of this week for “Singapore says ‘No’ to wearable devices for Covid-19 contact tracing.” It explains how easily the device will be able to surveil citizens, and states:
The Government looks to the Covid-19 pandemic as the perfect excuse to realise what it has always envisioned for us – this country’s populace: to surveil us with impunity, to track us without any technological inhibitions, and maintain a form of movement monitoring on each of us at all times and places. And to do so by decreeing it compulsory for all law-abiding persons to become ‘recipients’.
We – as free, independent, and lawful members of the public of Singapore – condemn the device’s implementation as blatant infringements upon our rights to privacy, personal space, and freedom of movement. We reject the notion that the non-efficacy of the Trace Together initiative be superceded by a regime that could potentially require all members of the public (regardless of their age, susceptibility to disease, or health status) to give up these rights under fear – not of infection from Covid-19 – but of prosecution by the state.
The point of showing you all of this is not to scare you. We’ve had enough of that, and we should probably brace for more. It’s also tempting to think that I’ve taken you to these vistas of dark possibilities because I get off on terrifying readers, or desire a reputation for traumatically scaring my readers. I do not.
There is a lot going on and it is more than some people can take. If you use fitness trackers, hopefully Mikey Sklar’s experience can help you (he will also tell you what he did while surviving it, all you have to do is ask him).
But I’m also looking into the face of all this injustice, unfairness, greed, madness, and unnecessary heartbreak here on this page because, well, anger is a form of hope -- and we need as much of that as we can right now. As inconceivable as it is, the US has officially unflattened the curve, so terribly that the world is readying to quarantine us to our own soil. I think we can be forgiven for being angry, being scared, and for there being just an overwhelming sadness in everything we do.
I also think it is entirely appropriate to talk about why and how we DIY our way through this, whether it’s learning from fitness tracker hackers, demanding answers for people who can’t access these technologies because of inequalities tech startups refuse to acknowledge, or seeing the people of Singapore oppose invasive digital tracking and learning from it. We are no longer bewitched by shiny gadgets that offer convenience and connectivity. It’s time to make those gadgets work for us, instead."

On its end, Apple is adding exposure notification functionality to iOS 13.5, released today, so its devices should work with the API and iOS apps that use it. Google is rolling out a Play Services update today, so Android devices running 6.0 and above will be compatible.
As previously reported, PHAs that use the API must agree to only use the tech for COVID-19 contact tracing. Users must consent before the app uses the API and before they share a positive test result. Users can also turn exposure notifications on and off. Apps cannot request access to location data, and they are not permitted to use user data for things like targeted advertising.
The API will allow PHAs to define what constitutes an exposure event and determine transmission risk factors. For instance, a PHA may decide to send exposure notifications if you were exposed for several minutes (say, on public transit) but not if you were exposed for a few seconds (passing someone on the sidewalk). 
Despite safeguards put in place to protect user privacy -- all metadata associated with Bluetooth will be encrypted -- the API and contact tracing apps will likely raise privacy concerns. And yet, to be truly effective, they will need widespread adoption."

 We’ve got to be ready for the long haul If you’ve been marking the pandemic by the pileup of cautious reopenings and rescheduled events, you might think that an end to this global disaster is in sight. Event planners for the Kentucky Derby and Bonnaroo already have new opening days on the books in September. The Olympics are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 23rd, 2021. There’s just one problem: if anyone says that they know exactly when this pandemic will be over, they are lying. 
No one can see the future. The virus is an unknown player, and the best minds on Earth can’t do more than make educated guesses about what comes next and when. Hell, we didn’t even notice the blood clot situation until just recently. 
I know. A guess is not comforting when you’re dreading another week of monotony in the same four walls. End dates are comforting. Reopenings are comforting. Contemplating a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present. But let’s not confuse comfort for truth. 
a future that looks a lot like our cozy, crowded past is way more comforting than our isolated present

When bowling alleys and tattoo parlors reopened in Georgia on Friday, the pandemic was not over. It won’t be over when the stay-at-home order in Michigan (maybe) lifts on April 30th or if the stay-at-home order in the Bay Area actually ends on May 31st. 
The dates politicians are throwing around are not finish lines. They aren’t guesses at an end date for this pandemic, either. Shelter-in-place orders are just time-outs. We have no sure-fire treatments for the virus, no vaccine, and a limited supply of health care workers. To keep as many people alive as possible, we’ve done the only thing we can do to slow the spread: we’ve hid from each other.
The virus’s effects have not been, as some proposed, a great equalizer. The less you have, the harder you’re hit. The federal government has mostly failed at leading a coherent response to the pandemic. Doctors are clashing with the FBI over PPE, then running into the ER with whatever they can scrounge up. Governors are hitting up their private-jet-owner friends to have masks flown in from China to equip their hospitals. Nurses at other facilities are resorting to wearing garbage bags in an unsuccessful bid to avoid contracting the virus on the job. 
People who are already vulnerable are getting hit the hardest. Death rates have soared in black communities already slammed by other public health crises. On the Navajo Nation, experts worry that water shortages are contributing to the virus’s continued spread. The virus has raged through cramped homeless shelters and through the communities that can’t afford to distance themselves. “It’s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,” an ER doctor working in Elmhurst, Queens told The New Yorker. “People hear that term ‘essential workers.’ Short-order cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers—that is the patient population here.” In some US prisons, the vast majority of inmates are testing positive for the virus, leaving incarcerated persons in fear for their lives. One inmate, Sterling Rivers, grimly observed that “Our sentences have turned into death sentences” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Our failures around the coronavirus are systemic failures of public policy.
Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries

Those failures have left the health care system struggling to cope, plunged society into a well of uncertainty, and sent the economy cratering. Thanks to an inconsistent and often incoherent government response in the US, we now face an uncertain timeline for both economic and health recoveries. Twenty-six million people have filed unemployment claims. 
And so some governors will call an end to stay-home orders in the hopes of resuscitating their economies. In Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Tennessee, that time came on Friday. Other states, like California and New York, are taking a longer view, gradually easing some restrictions on movement while enforcing new requirements — masks on, low temps, can’t lose. 
As cases decrease, restrictions will relax. But once we let our guard down, we’ll likely see resurgences of cases, once again straining health resources — leaving us with no choice but to close ourselves off again. That’s what’s happening in parts of China now, where new outbreaks of the same disease have emerged. The open-and-shut economy will likely continue as cases ebb and flow. 
There are paths to victory, but as Ezra Klein notes at Vox, “these aren’t plans for returning to anything even approaching normal.” Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don’t have yet. Scientific discoveries will help defeat the virus — but science can’t do it alone. Public policies will play a huge role, and even with firm health guidelines and speedy scientific developments, it will take longer than we want for us to truly eke out a win.
What does a win look like? It will take widespread tests of everyone who might be sick and careful quarantining of anyone who tests positive. It will take armies of contact tracers to trace down anyone who might have been exposed. These low-tech interventions are the best thing we’ve got while we give researchers the time they need to come up with other solutions.
Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors

Scientists will labor over vaccines and treatments, but the overwhelming majority of their trials will turn up nothing useful. They’ll also keep trying to understand the virus and our bodies’ complicated response to it, in the hopes of developing legitimate antibody tests. Eventually, we may discover something that destroys the virus without wrecking our bodies. But none of that is ready today.
The end is still likely to be a long way away, as journalist Ed Yong writes in The Atlantic: “The pandemic is not a hurricane or a wildfire. It is not comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Such disasters are confined in time and space. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will linger through the year and across the world.”
Consider this a rebuilding year. It might even turn into rebuilding years, depending on our progress. Our brightest prospects — vaccines and treatments — are still in the minors. Even antibody testing isn’t ready to be called up to the big leagues, at least not yet. 
This is a long game, and focusing on the victory celebrations — like New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s plan to “throw the biggest, best parade to honor” health care workers — won’t get us to the end. 
If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed

If we focus on what victory looks like instead of what it takes to get us there, we’re going to keep being disappointed. We’ll feel defeated every time a drug fails in testing. We can’t let it get to us like that. The parades, the ballgames, the worship services that we’re looking forward to, those will be there once this is over. What we’ve got to ensure now is that when we get to reopening day — whenever it is — that our concert halls and stadiums and spiritual homes are filled with as many of our human siblings as we can possibly save. 
It still sucks when the goalposts move from April 15th to April 30th, then to May 15th. It feels like we’re Charlie Brown and the end to this is a football that Lucy keeps pulling away. But when it comes to the virus itself, the clock isn’t the statistic that matters. These are the ones that do: numbers of tests, numbers of new infections, and numbers of bodies in the morgues. 
When the numbers of tests go up and confirmed cases and deaths go down, then our playbook will change. But it won’t be the end of the fight — not yet. 
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars

We play this through to the end — there is no other option. Victory might look like a vaccine. It might look like a robust testing regime or a new treatment. It might look like us cobbling together a sense of normalcy and still watching for repeated outbreaks. Whatever form it takes, we’ll fight our way there with masks, thermometers, and soap, buying some time along the way. We’ll adjust our playbook as the virus adapts. We’ll position ourselves farther apart. We’ll do it again, and again when the next waves of this virus come. We will be exhausted when we get there, but we will get there. But if we don’t pace ourselves for the long haul, it will be that much harder to get through.
We won’t be able to mark this finale in our calendars. All we can do is get through today, pushing our leaders to get the people on the front lines the resources and time they need to get us through this. We need politicians who will stop telling us the comforting things we want to hear and start acting to keep as many of us alive as possible."

President Donald Trump said hes taking antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine and zinc because he believes the drugs could prevent COVID-19. 
Heres my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it, he said today in a White House roundtable with restaurant executives. Trump said hes been taking the drugs every day for a week and a half and that he has not had any COVID-19 symptoms. People close to the president, including one of Trumps valets and Vice President Mike Pences press secretary, recently tested positive for the virus. 
Side effects include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness
There is still no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine can prevent someone from contracting or getting sick from the coronavirus. Its a possibility a number of research groups are running clinical trials to see if the drug could protect health care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus from getting sick but no data from those studies is available yet. 
Trump said hes following the lead of frontline workers. You look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative, he said. While there are clinical trials looking specifically at using the drug as a preventive for health care workers, it is still not clear how many health care workers are taking the drug. Side effects of hydroxychloroquine include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness.
Trump spent weeks promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His administration reportedly pushed the Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to authorize the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of the hospital, based on meager evidence. While early data showed that hydroxychloroquine may help some patients, additional studies found that it wasnt effective and could have dangerous side effects, especially in people with severe symptoms. Trump stopped touting the drug after that data was publicized. In April, the FDA warned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside the hospital or a clinical trial.
While Trump says that he is taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, that cant be independently verified. All the public has is his word, and neither henor his White House has been reliable sources of information during this pandemic. Among other things, Trump has spent the pandemic publicly recommending treatment strategies for COVID-19 based on limited evidence. In late April, he appeared to suggest that Lysol injections could cure the disease. No therapies have been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. 
At time of publication, more than 90,000 people in the United States have died of the disease.

Even with Twitter’s promise to ban promotion of ineffective treatment, these accounts shared false studies claiming that hydroxychloroquine treatment has a 100 percent success rate and endorsements for licorice root and Zinc as virus cures. Some said social distancing was “ineffective,” and Icke posted that the virus was a scam.

The organizers also confirmed the meeting at Gateshead in England, which was scheduled for Aug. 16, has been postponed. 
“Following the latest government announcements on the organization of major events in France, meeting organizers concluded that there is not enough time to organize a world-class international event in the French capital this year,” the Diamond League said in a statement. 
The event in Eugene, which was originally scheduled for Oct. 6, was scrapped as the state of Oregon currently has a ban of gatherings, including sporting events until at least the end of September. 
“The ban, combined with the expected long term restrictions on international travel, make it impossible to host a world class track &amp; field meet,” the statement said. 
The Diamond League has identified Sept. 12 as a possible alternate date for the Gateshead meeting but must wait before announcing confirmation due to British government guidelines and restrictions. 
Due to the growing number of countries affected by the COVID-19 virus, the Diamond League season could not start as planned in Doha on April 17. 
Meetings have been since canceled in London, Rabat and Zurich - which was originally scheduled to host the season finale in September - while other events on the calendar were postponed due to the pandemic. 
British Athletics announced on Friday that the British Athletics Championships will take place on Sept. 4-5 behind closed doors at the Manchester Regional Arena.

FIFA’s plan means world soccer’s governing body will dip into its reserves to provide national federations with a number of grants and interest-free loans to cope with budget hits. 
FIFA had already provided the immediate release of all funds from its ‘Forward’ projects and given the green light for such grants to be used for COVID-19 relief plans with a minimum of 50% of released funds to be allocated to women’s football. 
The third stage of the plans, unanimously backed by the FIFA Council on Thursday, allows for a ‘universal solidarity grant’ of $1 million dollars to all national associations with an additional $500,000 specifically for women’s football. 
Each regional confederation will receive a grant of $2 million. 
FA’s will be able to apply for loans, amounting to up to 35% of their audited, annual revenues up to a maximum of $5 million with confederations able to request up to $4 million. 
“Both grants and loans can be directed by member associations to the wider football community in their respective territories, including clubs, players, leagues, or others that have been affected by COVID,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 
Infantino added that there would be strict controls on the use of funds, audit requirements, as well as clear loan repayment conditions. 
Olli Rehn, the deputy chairman of the FIFA Governance Committee, who is Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, will head a committee set up to administer the funds. 
The council also backed changes to the calendar to support confederations’ desires to extend international breaks to allow for fixture congestion and rearranged matches. 
Infantino said no decision has yet to be taken on the rescheduling of the new Club World Cup tournament which has been postponed from July 2021 due to the postponement of Euro 2020 and the Copa America. 
The council also gave the green light to a new pan-Arab tournament to be played in 2021 in Qatar as a ‘test event’ for the 2022 World Cup. 
The invitational competition will be contested by Arab nations from Africa and Asia and feature home-based players only. 
The tournament will be held in from 1-18 December 2021 and be run by Qatar’s World Cup organising committee.

Remdesivir is indicated for moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 for patients in intensive care who require oxygen, while Favipiravir is indicated for mild to moderate cases. 
Eva Pharma, a generic drugmaker established in 1997, said earlier this month it had received a licence from Gilead Sciences Inc to make Remdesivir in Egypt and distribute it in 127 countries. 
It will initially make 500,000 doses a month to be sold locally for less than 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($124.07) each, said general manager Amgad Talaat, adding that they had already started delivering the medicine to quarantine hospitals. 
It has also started producing 1 million Favipiravir tablets a month, which will be on the market within two to three weeks, Talaat said. The price has still to be finalised. 
Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp, which makes Favipiravir under the brand name Avigan, said this month its research on the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment may need to continue until July. 
Eva Pharma said it had received permission from Egypt’s pharmaceutical regulatory authority to produce the drugs, and the body would decided whether they could be sold in pharmacies or only used in hospitals. 
Talaat said that once Egyptian needs were met, Eva Pharma hoped to sell any excess doses to other Middle Eastern and African countries. 
Egypt’s Rameda Pharmaceutical also said this month it had begun making Favipiravir under the brand name Anviziram and had approval to manufacture Remedsivir.

Taken together, these changes will make it easier for Britons to travel abroad for summer holidays.

The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated economic problems that worsened after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 from Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions. On Monday, Iran’s rial currency fell to its lowest ever level against the U.S. dollar. 
“It’s been the most difficult year due to the enemy’s economic pressure and the pandemic,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.  
“The economic pressure that began in 2018 has increased ... and today it is the toughest pressure on our dear country.” 
Iran has seen a sharp increase in coronavirus infections and deaths since restrictions to stem the spread of the pandemic were gradually lifted from mid-April. The death toll has recently topped 100 a day for the first time in two months. 
More than 220,000 cases have been confirmed, and over 10,000 deaths. 
Rouhani said wearing of masks will become mandatory for two weeks starting next Sunday in “gathering places” that are deemed “red spots”. 
Senior officials have regularly warned that restrictions will be reimposed if health regulations such as social distancing to stem the surge in infections are not observed. 
Iran launched a campaign on Saturday to motivate a reluctant public to use face masks.

BRAZIL 
- President Jair Bolsonaro 
March 24: 
“With my history as an athlete, if I were infected by the virus I would not have to worry. I would feel nothing or, at most, it would be a little flu or a little cold.” 
March 29, after touring streets in the suburbs of Brasilia without a mask: 
“This is the reality: the virus is there. We have to face it, but face it like a man, damn it, not like a kid. We’ll confront the virus with reality. That’s life. We’re all going to die one day.” 
April 28, when asked by journalists about the latest death toll: “So what? I’m sorry, but what do you want me to do?” 
BRITAIN 
- Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
March 3: 
“But at this stage, and with the exception of all of the points I have just mentioned, I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual.” 
May 2, in an interview here with The Sun newspaper after falling seriously ill and recovering from COVID-19: 
“It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place.” 
“The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.” 
CHINA 
- Zhong Nanshan, head of team investigating coronavirus outbreak at National Health Commission

“The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society ... For us, this is a crisis and is also a big test.” 
ITALY 
- Silvia Bertuletti, 48, from Bergamo in northern Italy. Her 78-year-old father died on March 19 from COVID-19

- Riccardo Munda, a doctor near Bergamo 
April 5: 
“What led to this situation is that many family doctors didn’t visit their patients for weeks. And I can’t blame them, because that’s how they saved their own skin.” 
- Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte 
Feb 22, when 7 people have died and more than 280 infected in Italy: 
“Italy is a safe country for travel and for tourism, probably safer than many others.” 
March 4, when Italy closed all schools and universities as the virus had killed 107 and infected 3,089 people: 
“Our hospitals, despite their efficiency, risk being overwhelmed, we have a problem with intensive-care units.” 
NEW ZEALAND 
- Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern 
June 8: 
“New Zealanders did something remarkable in our fight to beat COVID-19. We united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus.” 
RUSSIA 
- President Vladimir Putin 
April 8: 
“Everything passes and this will pass. Our country has gone through serious trials more than once: the Pechenegs tormented it, as did the Polovtsy - Russia coped with everything. We will also defeat this coronavirus infection. Together we will overcome it.” 
“I understand fatigue has built up as well as a serious burden of financial, domestic and other everyday problems. Your normal rhythm of life has been broken. For most people it is dreary and nauseous to constantly remain within four walls. But there is no choice now.” 
SPAIN 
- Defence Minister Margarita Robles 
March 24: 
“On some of its visits (to nursing homes), the army has seen some old people, the elderly, absolutely abandoned if they were not dead in their beds.” 
Victor Pedrera, a doctor from a healthcare centre in the Spanish port city of Alicante.

Feb 27: 
“It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” 
April 23: 
“I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that.” 
VATICAN 
- Pope Francis 
March 27: 
“Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities. It has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void that stops everything as it passes by; we feel it in the air ... We find ourselves afraid and lost.”

“The demand exceeds our production,” Christoph Franz was quoted as saying in Saturday’s paper. The decision on where tests were shipped to depended, among other things, on infection rates and the availability of diagnostic equipment. 
Demand for its antibody tests, which determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, can be met as Roche has been boosting production, he said. 
The drugmaker has said that it aims to more than double production of antibody tests to well over 100 million a month by the end of the year. 
Franz said that Roche had started research on a potential drug to treat COVID-19 but added that these efforts were at a very early stage.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
The EU is stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, requesting that US tech giants produce monthly reports containing detailed data on how they are combatting fake news about COVID-19 on their platforms. 
Google, Facebook, and Twitter are the prime targets of this campaign, and the three companies told The Verge they would be complying with the EUs requests. Exactly what steps they will take, though, and when they might start producing reports is unknown.
Tackling misinformation from the anti-vaccine movement will be key
The EU is worried that misinformation surrounding the coronavirus could prolong the effects of the pandemic. This is a particular problem with the anti-vaccine movement, which has an outsized influence online and will likely rally against any future COVID-19 vaccine. Scientist say a vaccine is necessary for countries around the world to return to normal, but many nations are easing lockdown measures anyway, inviting a second wave of infections.
While additional information on COVID-19 misinformation could help coordinate responses across the tech industry, its not clear if the EUs request will produce that useful data.
For a start, tech giants are not legally required to produce these new monthly reports. Theres also no guidance on exactly what the reports should contain, and companies The Verge spoke to said they were still working out what information to include. 
The request is also not part of the EUs voluntary Code of Practice on Disinformation, which requires signatories like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to report on a monthly basis on their actions undertaken to improve the scrutiny of ad placements, ensure transparency of political and issue-based advertising and to tackle fake accounts and malicious use of bots.
The reports will be launched without delays
A representative for the EU told The Verge the program would be launched without delays and that detailed timings would soon be made public. The EU has told tech companies it would rather the data was comprehensive than rushed, and its likely the format will be similar to reports produced to tackle misinformation about the 2019 EU elections. 
Spokespersons for Google, Facebook, and Twitter, told The Verge they supported the EUs efforts and had already stepped up plans to combat misinformation about the pandemic on their platforms. Facebook and Google said they were committed to producing new monthly reports, while Twitter said it was still considering how to present this information, but that it would be adding regular updates to its coronavirus misinformation blog.
The global pandemic has shown that more people need more accurate information more than ever, Matt Brittin, president of Google EMEA, told The Verge. Through our cooperation with Vice-President Jourova and national authorities we know that working together, companies and policymakers can make more difference than working alone. Were committed to the Code of Practice and to our work together to find new and creative ways to continue the fight against disinformation."

 The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins June 1st, and it’s going to be a doozy. “Hurricane season is off to a busy start!” the National Hurricane Center tweeted as it forecast an 80 percent chance of a tropical depression forming over the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico this week. 
There’s a 60 percent chance that this will be a worse-than-normal hurricane season, NOAA forecast last week. That could look like up to 19 named storms, including up to six major hurricanes. An average hurricane season is generally made up of around 12 named storms, with three major hurricanes.
There’s a 60 percent chance that this will be a worse-than-normal hurricane season

2020, of course, has been anything but normal. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to make any unfavorable weather event, from heat waves to hurricanes, much tougher to prepare for and respond to.
“Social distancing and other CDC guidance to keep you safe from COVID-19 may impact the disaster preparedness plan you had in place, including what is in your go-kit, evacuation routes, shelters and more,” Carlos Castillo, acting deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA said in a statement when NOAA made its forecast for the season on May 24th. “With tornado season at its peak, hurricane season around the corner, and flooding, earthquakes and wildfires a risk year-round, it is time to revise and adjust your emergency plan now.”

More than 60 percent of 70 coastal counties surveyed by the AP were still figuring out their hurricane shelter plans in late May, the wire service reported yesterday. Shelters and evacuation measures will need to be reimagined to limit the potential spread of disease in typically tightly packed, enclosed places. That will be tough on health care facilities, emergency response systems, and government budgets that have already been stretched almost to their limits during the pandemic, Vox reported. States have also depended on a cohort of older volunteers, and their ranks will shrink almost in half this year as people more susceptible to COVID-19 stay home, according to The New York Times.

Although hurricane season technically just started, a couple storms decided to crash the party early. Two storms earned their names, Arthur and Bertha, last month, which happens when sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. 
Not only are some hurricanes arriving early, overall they’ve also gotten stronger over the past 40 years, a new NOAA study confirmed in May. Hurricanes gain strength from heat energy, and there’s more of that to fuel them because of climate change. Warmer water leads to more moisture in the air and more intense hurricanes as a result."

<li>With scattered reports of recovered COVID-19 patients testing positive again, a lot of people are wondering if it's possible to develop immunity at all.</li>
<li>Chances are many people will develop some sort of immunity but your immune system isn't …",https://www.businessinsider.com/can-you-get-the-coronavirus-twice-antibody-test-2020-5,https://i.insider.com/5ebd6ff17d5fdf00d373c523?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-05-19T17:15:00Z,"Following is a transcript of the video. 
Narrator: Let's assume you've had COVID-19. You might believe you're immune, in the clear to go about your normal life without safety precautions. But with scattered reports of recovered cases testing positive again, a lot of people are wondering if it's possible to develop immunity at all. So, can you catch COVID-19 twice? The thing is, scientists just aren't sure, because figuring that out is a lot more complicated than you might think.
When a pathogen like a virus manages to get into a human, their body will signal an alarm. This will start what's referred to as the innate immune response and consists of physical, chemical, and cellular defenses against pathogens. Often enough, this works, and the invader is killed, but sometimes you need a second attack. The adaptive immune response marshals the special forces: B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that smother the specific pathogen so it can't affect your body's cells.
Shane Crotty: So, basically, antibodies kill virus outside of cells; killer T cells kill virus inside of cells.
Narrator: So, once your body fights the pathogen, what stops you from having to fight off the same attack over and over? Well, your body has a secret weapon to protect you against any future attacks from the same pathogen: memory cells. Memory cells are basically the specialized T cells and B cells that stick around as guards. That way, if you encounter the virus again, the army will be readily waiting to kill that invader instantly. This is immunity.
A vaccine works on this basis by adding dead, weakened, or fragmented parts of a pathogen to your body. Not enough to cause illness, but enough to cause your body to produce memory cells.
Crotty: Normally, when you have an infection, it's a race between your immune system and the infection. But if you're vaccinated, you've already done the race part. Your immune system has already had time to scale up and develop immunity.
Narrator: Typically, you would know if you have immunity, either from a vaccine or knowing you previously had the illness. For example, it's relatively straightforward to know whether you've had chickenpox or not because the symptoms are highly unique and very easy to spot. But let's presume you know you've had COVID-19. You now have immunity and are safe, right?
To test this theory, one early study infected monkeys with the COVID-19 virus. They then waited till they tested negative after the infection passed and tried to reinfect them. When the monkeys didn't become reinfected, researchers concluded that after one viral attack, you would be protected from another. But this isn't a golden ticket to thinking you're immune, because the length and strength of that potential immunity are unknown.
And where a disease lies on the spectrum is influenced by two things, memory cell death rate and virus mutation rate. Memory cell death rate tells you at what rate those memory cells may be lost over time. The virus mutation rate can tell you if the virus will mutate too quickly for your memory cells. The more a virus mutates, the more unrecognizable it becomes to your memory cells. Determining where COVID-19 falls on this timescale is a vital step in managing its spread.
One indication of how long its immunity might last is to look at other coronaviruses. Those who have contracted SARS-1 have been found to have immunity for about two to three years, and the same time frame has been seen in other coronaviruses that can cause the common cold. Yet early signs have shown that this virus tends to mutate slowly. But there's another indicator into immunity strength and length: the serology test.
Crotty: The serology testing is a blood test for the presence of antibodies against that specific virus or that specific disease.
Narrator: Importantly, these are tests that can be done after you've recovered from symptoms.
Crotty: And you don't have to know exactly when that person was infected. And so that's a very powerful way to count how many people have actually been infected, whether they recognize the symptoms or not.
Narrator: These tests can measure how many antibodies are in the sample by looking at how they block or respond to the virus. These measurements can help to understand immunity levels and how long immunity could last. For example, studies for many other viral infections have found that the more severe the case, the longer the immunity. Basically, the bigger the infection, the bigger the immune response and more antibodies in a sample, which in turn gives longer immunity. But this may not hold true for COVID-19.
Crotty: It certainly may not be as simple as if you're positive for the antibody, you're protected against the disease, you're immune. That's true for many infections; it's not proven for COVID-19 disease.
Narrator: And the effectiveness of certain serology tests for COVID-19 has been mixed. Some tests are being misused, and others were brought into the United States before the FDA could approve them. The result has been poor detection rates, some as low as 20%.
Crotty: You know, these are the same types of tests as a pregnancy test. And so there's no way people would take pregnancy tests if they were only accurate 60% of the time.
Narrator: And there have been instances of false positives, which can be extremely dangerous, because they arm people with a false sense of potential immunity. But these problems aren't universal, and the FDA has begun approving a select few that show much higher accuracy. So, with an accurate serology test, would you be immune?
Well, one early Chinese study found 30% of those who tested positive for the virus had little to no detectable antibodies, which would suggest that immunity isn't guaranteed, though this has been challenged by another study that found all patients tested had significant antibody levels. But other issues such as age or health could play into these responses.
Crotty: Is it gonna be 0.1% of people who can get reinfected three months later? Or is it going to be a higher number in the elderly?
Narrator: Once more accurate and universal testing is underway, more studies can begin to more precisely examine how long this immunity may last and who has it. So our best bet right now is to keep our distance and assume we're not immune at all.

Welcome to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly healthcare newsletter. We've made it to Memorial Day weekend! Hope everyone's found a restful way to spend the long weekend. Is anyone else getting nostalgic for past three-day weekend plans?

We're getting our first signs of how well a coronavirus vaccine might work
This week, we got results from not one but two vaccine efforts. 
On Monday, Moderna Therapeutics released the first human results from coronavirus vaccine efforts, finding that in a small number of healthy volunteers, the vaccine created immune responses that could help protect people from being infected by the novel coronavirus.
Then on Friday, Chinese biotech CanSino published data from its vaccine trial, supporting additional trials of the vaccine. 
Moderna and CanSino's efforts are among the six vaccine efforts analysts at Morgan Stanley think are the most promising of the 100+ in development. Should further research prove they're effective at preventing the virus, the vaccines could be here as soon as this fall, though it'll likely be mid-2021 before they're widely available. (New to BI Prime? Use my link here to get 20% off your BI Prime subscription.)
Andrew Dunn spoke to Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel after the company announced the results on Monday. One of his biggest worries at this point: making sure there's enough vaccine to go around. 
But to be sure, there are big questions we need have answered about the potential vaccine.
Andrew outlines them here:

Meanwhile, Yeji Lee went deeper down the rabbit hole of skin complications popping up in patients who've tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
While COVID-19 predominantly impacts the lungs, doctors are noticing everything from clotting complications to symptoms like loss of smell and dizziness. 
Yeji reports the American Academy of Dermatology has logged 600 submissions of skin-related problems seen in patients with COVID-19 — including, of course, ""COVID toes"" as well as rashes, hive-like symptoms, and blisters.

Medical complications aren't the only problems showing up in COVID-19. Financially, things are getting complicated both for patients and companies. 
Kimberly Leonard has been keeping tabs on the organizations that received stimulus money from the CARES Act. She found that CVS Health received $43.3 million and decided to return it. The funding was automatically sent to providers that bill Medicare in April.
Meanwhile, Republicans are clashing with Democrats over the next stimulus bill. In particular, Republicans want to shield companies from coronavirus lawsuits. Last Friday, the House passed the $3 trillion bill called the HEROES Act, which doesn't include those provisions. Kimberly has the roundup of all that Republicans are pushing for.
For patients, the financials are complicated too. The Trump administration has been working to make sure patients are shielded from high healthcare costs related to coronavirus treatment. Even so, Kimberly spoke with patients — both insured and uninsured — who have still faced high medical bills for treatment and testing.

<li>This summer could see a resurgence in the all-American road trip, with travelers still hesitant to fly for a vacation driving instead.</li>
<li>It's important to stay safe and smart, even during a road trip in your own car.</li>
<li>Be mindful about …",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-road-trip-safely-during-coronavirus-checklist-2020-6,https://i.insider.com/5ef235c0aee6a873d760fb94?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-06-23T17:52:11Z,"For many this summer, flying to a destination vacation is likely off the table thanks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Analysts have warned that air travel demand won't go back to pre-outbreak levels until at least midway through next year. Instead, a recent survey conducted by the US Travel Association and MMGY Travel Intelligence found that 67% of travelers are likely to travel with their personal cars during the next six months — which is ""more than double the percentage planning to travel by air during the same time period.""
So, that means a return to the all-American road trip. ""Road trips are forms of travel and movement…"" Stanford University American history professor Allyson Hobbs told PBS in 2017. ""Travel is a social and cultural practice that Americans have used to construct ideas about themselves, their society, the past, and the future."" 
But folks looking to protect themselves against the virus know that it won't be a simple return to the road. There are safety measures to be kept in mind. Precautions to be taken. Plans to be made. 
Also, understand that taking a road trip might not be feasible for every household. It's tempting to get away for a bit, but when you come in contact with others or go to highly trafficked places, your exposure to the virus might increase.
Here's a checklist on how to safely road-trip this summer during the pandemic. 
Plan your route and location.
Despite many places opening back up for business in the US, this does not signal an end to the pandemic. You can still contract the virus, which is why it's especially important to plan ahead. 
Map out which roadways and states you will pass through, recommends AARP. There might be relevant travel advisories you need to be aware of, such as changes to toll collection and rest-area food sales. 
According to Jeanette Casselano, a AAA spokesperson, it's also especially important to call ahead and confirm which attractions (such as any local attractions or theme parks) and hotels are open. 
""You will want to understand capacity limits and, where possible, make reservations in advance,"" she says.
Pack to protect and sanitize.
Now more than ever, it's important to pack up your car with hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, sanitizing spray, face masks, gloves, and maybe even a thermometer. And keep practicing good and frequent hand-washing. 
If you can, pack your own snacks and drinks so you reduce the need to go into rest stops and expose yourself to others. 
AAA also suggests you travel with all necessary travel documentation, including health insurance cards. 
Furthermore, the agency recommends storing an emergency kit in your car. The list includes: car charger for your cell phone, first-aid kit, blanket, drinking water and snacks for everyone including pets, flashlight with extra fresh batteries, rags or paper towels, basic tools including duct tape, road flares or reflectors, ice scraper or snow brush, jumper cables, traction aid (sand, salt), tarp, raincoat, and a shovel. 
These items, obviously, won't be applicable to everyone reading this. But as with everything, use your best judgment and common sense. Be realistic about your plans and where you are going.
Take proper precautions at rest stops and gas stations.
If you need to stop in at a rest stop or a gas station to use the bathroom, do your best not to touch anything. If there are others in close proximity, wear a mask. Wear gloves or even plastic sandwich bags over your hands as a barrier between your skin and other surfaces. When you're done, wash your hands well or use hand sanitizer. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that physical cash, credit, and debit cards could be a source of virus transmission, so it advises people not to touch their faces after handling paper and coin money. 
Money should be placed on the counter rather than handed over directly. Counters should be wiped between each customer. People should use hand sanitizer after transactions and take advantage of touchless payment options when they are available. 
When pumping gas, do so either with gloves on or some other kind of barrier between your skin and everything else. The gas pumps, number pads, and touch screens at gas stations are all touched by many people throughout the day and it's best to just avoid contact with them if at all possible. 
And instead of using your fingertips to press buttons, try using your knuckle. At the end of the process, use hand sanitizer. 
Sanitize your space before you eat.
As mentioned above, it's recommended that you pack extra refreshments in your car to cut back on trips to convenience stores, but if you must eat-in, AAA suggests you first wipe down the table with a disinfectant wipe and to use hand sanitizer after interacting with servers or cashiers.
Do consider drive-through or curbside pick-up as options, as they reduce your interaction with other people.
And always try and call ahead and see if a restaurant or service stop is open. Some operate on altered hours or have longer-than-usual wait times because of capacity reduction efforts.
Sanitize your overnight accommodations.
Keep in mind that not all hotels might be operating normally, so it's smart to call ahead and confirm your reservation if you are planning to stay overnight somewhere, AARP reports. 
And if you do decide to say overnight, the CDC has a guide on how to clean and disinfect places like hotel rooms, which you can see here.
However, Casselano of AAA doesn't think many people will be staying overnight much right now. ""We expect Americans are going to take mostly local and regional trips to have flexibility and comfort of being able to return home,"" she says. 
Anticipate some traffic.
Many people — likely still hesitant about public transit — will turn, instead, to their cars to commute. Bloomberg estimates there will be a general spike in traffic, reporting that, ""Driving is rebounding all over the world, and it could eventually return stronger than ever, depending on how long commuters remain wary of public transit.""
Watch out for speeding.
During nationwide stay-at-home mandates, Business Insider reported a concerning spike in speeding on the country's emptier-than-normal highways. Law enforcement officials from across the US detailed a surge in dangerous driving and called it a ""free-for-all"" on empty roads. 
Be careful of dangerous speeding while traveling and know that local law enforcement is aware of the issue and is looking out for it as well. 
AAA suggests drivers practice a system called R.E.A.D the Road:
<ol><li>Right speed for right now </li><li>Eyes up, brain on </li><li>Anticipate their next move </li><li>Donut of space around your car (in case you need to make an emergency maneuver)</li></ol>Breakdowns: tires and calling a technician.
It's inevitable: sometimes your car breaks down or you get a flat tire. What then? 
A good way to avoid mechanical breakdowns is to maintain your vehicle. Get regularly scheduled maintenance checkups, change your oil, and don't ignore unusual noises, vibrations, smells, or the check engine light. The more quickly you nip these issues in the bud, chances are the less the potentially resulting damage will be. 
Make sure your tires have a healthy amount of tread on them to ward off blowouts and other issues. Standard tread depth in the US is measured in one thirty-second of an inch (1/32 inch) increments, according to Tire America. Typically, new tires start with a tread depth of 10/32 inches with the actual, usable tread depth being 8/32 inches. If your tread is 2/32 inches or less, you need to replace the tire. 
Determining this is easy — all you need is a penny, according to Goodyear Auto Service. 
Insert a penny into the tire's tread groove with Lincoln's head facing you and upside down. If you can see all of his head, it means your tread depth is less than 2/32 inches and you should get your tires replaced. 
Of course, it's also highly recommended you take your car to a professional to have it looked over if you aren't sure. Tires are the only contact patch your vehicle makes with the road, so it makes sense to ensure they are in good shape.
If your car has a spare tire, consider learning how to change a tire yourself. There's a great guide on the Bridgestone website. This way, you'll be able to save yourself from calling a technician, and instead, you can drive yourself to a mechanic, thus cutting down on the number of human interactions in a day.
But if you do get really stuck, definitely call someone. ""Be sure to practice social distancing when the technician arrives,"" Casselano says. ""If your car needs to be towed, consider making arrangements for your own transportation.""

These devices could help bolster those efforts, and according to the MTA, it’s been working with Puro Lighting since mid-March to readapt the technology for MTA infrastructure. The devices can be installed in the ceiling, mounted on a wall or suspended.
“We know UVC can help disinfect surfaces in hospital operating rooms, and we owe it to our employees and customers to experiment with it in our system to keep them safe. If successful, the results could help disinfect our buses and train cars, crew rooms, and other facilities in a more timely and cost efficient [manner],” MTA Chief Innovation Officer Mark Dowd said in a statement.
Hopefully, the tech will make a difference in the fight against COVID-19 in New York City. It may also offer a glimpse of how society will move forward after the pandemic is over. We’ve seen UV light clean humidifiers, airplane bathrooms and toilets, and in the future, it may be used more often to disinfect shared surfaces and spaces. As Puro Lighting points out, in addition to killing 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria, the devices can also reduce the growth of fungi, like yeast and mold."

The organization will also encourage attendees and exhibitors to adopt best practices for the likes of shaking hands and wearing masks, but it's unclear whether face coverings will be mandatory. Engadget has asked the CTA for clarification, and whether it plans to reduce the capacity for next year.
CES 2021 won't take place for another seven months, and a lot can change in that time -- including future waves of coronavirus infections -- so it's perhaps a little premature to make firm plans for next year. At least one CES 2020 attendee had COVID-19 around the time of the event, and many others often leave Las Vegas with a case of the ""CES flu."" 
In any case, the CTA says major brands have committed to next year's show. CES 2021 will have a larger livestreaming schedule as part of the show's expanded digital presence, and the organization says it'll ""showcase our exhibitors’ products, technology breakthroughs and ideas to the world, both physically in Las Vegas and digitally."" Whether it'll actually be safe enough for a huge number of people to attend CES in person is still up in the air."

Productivity, which includes services like Office and LinkedIn, grew 16 percent year over year to $11.7 billion in revenuethat's a small step down compared to $11.8 in the immediate preceding quarter. Cloud, which includes Azure and GitHub, grew 27 percent year over year to $12.3 billion. And personal computingan umbrella that covers Windows, Xbox, and Surfacegrew a more modest 3 percent year over year to $11 billion.
All told, Microsoft's revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, down $2 billion from the previous quarter but up 15 percent from last year's Q3. Even Xbox, which saw an 11 percent drop last quarter, grew by three points. Microsoft this week announced that Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like subscription for accessing about 100 games on the Xbox One and Windows 10 platforms, reached 10 million subscribersmore evidence that subscription services and the like are now integral to the company's strategy across all its businesses.To that point, Azure grew 59 percent year over year, and it remains the biggest contributor to the company's growth. Azure's rate of growth has been slowing steadily over the past year, though.
While all this sounds promising, Microsoft cautioned that it may not be the end of the story. ""The effects of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in the financial results until future periods,"" the company wrote. It gave guidance to investors that it expects between $35.85 billion and $36.80 billion in revenue during its upcoming fourth quarter. If that ends up being accurate, it will have been the company's slowest growth quarter in a couple of years.
While Windows and Office still make for the heart of Microsoft's business, it has focused on growing subscription services out of those things. It recently announced a new, pseudo-Prime-like home user subscription service called Microsoft 365, it plans to launch a new game console called the Xbox Series X later this year, and it continues to compete fiercely with Amazon's AWS cloud service with Azure. That struggle was exemplified in the messy back-and-forth over the JEDI government contract, which has seemingly resolved in Microsoft's favor only recently."

We still don't know how well a robust immune response protects people from SARS-CoV-2 infection. But we've got a further indication that vaccines can induce a strong immune response. Just prior to the holiday weekend, a Chinese team released the results of a safety trial done using a harmless virus that had been modified to carry one of the coronavirus genes. While there were a number of side effects, everyone getting the vaccine had a robust antibody response, including some antibodies that neutralized the virus.
Familiar virus, new protein
The first indication of progress towards a vaccine that we're aware of came in the form of a company press release. This new one comes in the form of a peer-reviewed article in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet. Most of its authors are academic researchers or public health authorities; only two have affiliations with a company.
The two reports also differ significantly in terms of their approach to generating an immune response. The earlier announcement, from a company called Moderna, involved injecting carefully packed RNAs that encode the spike protein that normally resides on the surface of the virus. The RNAs transit inside a person's cells and induce them to to produce the spike protein, thereby exposing the immune system to it.
The Chinese researchers used a very different approach to inducing immunity. In their case, they engineered the gene that encodes the spike protein into a harmless virus called Adenovirus 5. They then produced large quantities of the engineered virus, and injected that into people. Even though adenoviruses are essentially unrelated to coronaviruses (they use DNA as their genetic material, rather than RNA), the cells that the engineered viruses infect will produce the coronavirus spike protein, again exposing the immune system to it.
Adenovirus is not without its complications, however, the foremost being that a lot of us have been exposed to it previously. In this case, that may not be a bad thing. The primary side effects are largely those you'd expect from injections of a virus: inflammation at the site of injection, and the fever, fatigue, and muscle aches typical of a viral infection. Most of these occurred in just under half of the 108 participants, with over 80 percent experiencing at least one of them. But those who had a high level of antibodies to Adenovirus 5 tended to have fewer side effects.
None of the side effects were deemed serious, and all of the participants stayed with the study through its 28-day checkup. Potentially problematic, however, was the finding that having a strong immune memory of adenovirus 5 reduced the immune system's response to the spike protein a bit.
Immunity
The researchers tracked whether injections of the vaccine induced the production of antibodies via a sensitive test. Antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein were apparent by 14 days after the vaccine's injection. By 28 days, all but three of the 108 participants had large increases in the level of antibodies to the spike protein. Quantifying the changes, the researchers found that a high dose of vaccine injection produced a response that was over double that of the low-dose group, with the medium dose falling in between. There was also a T cell response to the spike protein, which is important for a strong overall immune response.
The researchers also looked for antibodies that neutralized SARS-CoV-2, preventing it from infecting additional cells in culture. These were present in all the groups tested, with their frequency increasing with vaccine dose.
Overall, this is good news. But it's also incomplete. Neutralizing a virus in culture is very different from neutralizing it in an actual organism. And there have been cases in the past where a vaccine has induced antibodies that make it easier for a virus to infect cells (by stabilizing the conformation in which the virus latches on to cells). So, we don't know if the antibody production seen here will mean protectionthat's an issue for the next round of trials.
The authors also note that their participants were all younger than 60, so they didn't include the population that's at highest risk of infection.
Still, the work joins a number of similar studies that indicate it's not difficult to produce an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, and that response will typically include antibodies that neutralize the virus in tests. What we're currently lacking are two pieces of key information. One is whether neutralizing antibodies effectively block the spread of the virus in people. We should get some information on that as we start to wrap up trials of the use of blood plasma from previously infected individuals.
The other key question is now long any immunity lasts. There have been a couple of reports of possible re-infections, but they remain rare and the details of what's happening are lacking. This may be a question that we'll just need time to answer.
If you want details on the trial's design, it's available from ClinicalTrials.gov.

When Chinese officials in the city of Wuhan discovered a cluster of just six COVID-19 cases around two weeks agothe first cases there in more than a monththey quickly set an ambitious plan to test the entire city of roughly 11 million and crush a potential second wave of infection. And they initially planned to try to do it in just 10 days.
Ten days out, they nearly met that goal. Wuhan Municipal Health Commission swabbed more than 9 million residents and tested more than 6.5 million of those swabs for coronavirus genetic material between May 15 and May 24, according to state media.
Laboratories in the city went from conducting 46,000 tests a day to as many as 1.47 million in the screening sprint, according to The New York Times. The Times notes that in the US, New York tested 1.7 million people since March 4, a nearly three-months time frame, according to The Atlantics COVID Tracking Project.
Wuhan officials pulled off the mass screening in a staggered neighborhood-by-neighborhood sweep. Then they sped up swab processing by running tests in batches. That is, they combined material from five to ten swabs and tested the pooled sample all at once. If any of the pooled swabs were positive for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, officials could go back to that handful of people and retest them. This type of batched testing works well to quickly go through a population when cases are rare.
So far, the testing campaign has identified 218 asymptomatic cases, Wuhan officials reported. Those cases are now in quarantine.Now, with the bulk of the testing complete, city officials are working to check the leaks and fill the gaps to make sure no residents are missed.
Some residents have told the Times they opposed the testing campaign because it forced them to have more contact with others, potentially putting them at risk of an infection. However, others argued that the testing offered psychological benefits as people head back to work.
This push to test everyone would improve the vitality of the city and provide a scientific basis for the resumption of work, Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist at Wuhan University, told the Times. It can also make people feel at ease and give everyone some peace of mind."

An anti-corruption watchdog is pressing the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate executives of the biotech company Moderna after they cashed in about $90 million in company shares days after promoting positive"" but vague data from its early COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.
The watchdog group, Accountable.US, called the timing of the trades suspicious and questioned whether executives coordinated their stock sales prior to the data release.
In a letter to the SEC that was released to CBS Moneywatch, Accountable.US President Kyle Herrig wrote, ""This misconduct was particularly egregious because it involved not only financial fraud and manipulation of the financial markets, but also because it exploited widespread fears surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In all, the executives' exploitation served to ""boost the company's value, as well as their own bank accounts.
I strongly urge the SEC to investigate these matters,"" Herrig wrote.
Moderna is considered a front-runner in the race for a vaccine against the pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2. The company is testing a vaccine involving mRNA, an unproven vaccine platform that is not used for any existing vaccines. However, Moderna became prominent in the pandemic after partnering with the National Institutes of Health to design and test its vaccine. It was the very first vaccine to go into clinical trials, which began March 16.
On May 18, the company sent out a press release saying that eight trial participants had developed neutralizing antibodies at levels that mimicked those seen in people who recover from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moderna painted the results as positive, but experts were quick to note that the press release didnt contain any data and that the scant information provided is uninterpretable in terms of assessing the efficacy of the vaccine. Some also questioned why Moderna chose to release such incomplete data from a very small number of participants instead of waiting to publish a larger dataset in a peer-reviewed scientific journalwhich is standard practice.
Still, the press release set off a frenzy of ""encouraging"" coverage, and Modernas stock surged 30 percent, raising it to an all-time high of $87 a share. Amid the surge, Modernas CEO, several executives, and funds controlled by the chairman of the board sold about $90 million worth of stock, according to CBS Moneywatch.
Though the companys shares eventually sank and are now at $59 a share, CBS notes that executives are still cashing in millions of dollars worth of stock.
In a statement, Moderna defended the moves, saying, Executive sales are made under pre-planned 10b5-1 plans, which are executed during open trading windows in accordance with the company's insider trading policy."" The company said it does not comment on potential investigations."

Protective immune responses that build up during a SARS-CoV-2 infection may weaken just two to three months laterparticularly if the infection didnt come with any symptoms, a new study suggests.
The finding does not necessarily mean that people will no longer be immune to the novel coronavirus after a few months. The lower levels of the immune responses measured in the study may still be enough to thwart the virus, and there are other types of immune responses not examined in the study that play a role in immunity. Overall, there are still many unknowns about potential immunity to SAR-CoV-2 infections, including who is most protected and how long that protection may last.
But the authors of the new study say that their findings are enough to raise more concerns about the potential use of so-called immunity passports""documents indicating someone is immune based on past infection. The authorsa team of researchers in Chongqing, Chinaalso suggest that their findings support the continued use of physical distancing and other prevention efforts until we have a clearer understanding of immunity.
The strength and duration of immunity after infection are key issues for shield immunity and for informing decisions on how and when to ease physical distancing restrictions, the write. Their study appeared Thursday in Nature Medicine.
Case tracking
For the study, the team looked at immune responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients shortly after their infection and then two to three months later. The study was small, only including 37 asymptomatic cases, but it is the among the first to look at detailed immune responses in people who never develop symptoms in the course of their infection.
The asymptomatic cases were identified by contact tracing from known cases, then isolated in a hospital for the entirety of their infection. The 37 were identified out of a total of 178 cases in the Wanzhou District of Chongqing, for an asymptomatic case rate of 21 percent. Though none developed noticeable symptoms, more than half had abnormalities in their chest scans during their infection.
The researchers compared their immune responses to those from 37 people who had cases of symptomatic COVID-19. These symptomatic controls were matched to the asymptomatic cases by sex, age, and underlying health conditions.
Asymptomatic cases shed viral genetic material from their throats longer than the symptomatic casesa median of 19 days compared with 14 days, respectively. However, presence of viral genetic material doesnt necessarily reflect infectious viral particles, so its unclear if asymptomatic cases were infectious for longer than symptomatic cases.
Troubling declines
About three to four weeks after each cases initial exposure, the researchers looked for antibodiesthat is, Y-shaped proteins that the immune system makes to identify and disarm germs the body has already encountered. Overall, the asymptomatic cases had lower levels of anti-coronavirus antibodies than their symptomatic counterparts. They also had lower levels of inflammatory immune signals.
When the researchers looked at antibody levels again eight weeks after each case was discharged from the hospital, they found that both groups had significant declines in antibodies. In the asymptomatic group, 40 percent had no detectable levels of one type of antibodyIgGwhile 13 percent of symptomatic cases had no detectable levels. For comparison, in people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2's relative, SARS-CoV (the coronavirus that causes SARS), researchers have seen sustained IgG levels for more than 2 years.
But not all antibodies are equally effective at thwarting invading viruses, like SARS-CoV-2. The most effective are called neutralizing antibodies. The researchers of the new study specifically looked for these antibodies using an engineered pseudovirus designed to mimic SARS-CoV-2 as bait. The researchers found that 8 weeks after recovering, neutralizing antibody levels were still presentbut they had declined in 81 percent of asymptomatic cases and 62 percent of symptomatic cases.What this means for immunity is not yet clear. Another study published Thursday in Nature found that some neutralizing antibodies present at low levels are also the most potentpotentially hinting that low levels may be enough to protect against infection. But, researchers do not know this yet.
The authors of the Nature Medicine study say that more antibody studies profiling more symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are urgently needed to determine the duration of antibody-mediated immunity.

15 with 10 posters participating
Back in 2011, we covered the strange story of biochemist Judy Mikovits, who co-authored a controversial (and subsequently retracted) paper in the journal Science and eventually lost her prestigious position with a research institution. Now Mikovits is back in the news, having spent the ensuing years reinventing herself as a staunch anti-vaccine crusader.
The COVID-19 pandemic has given her a new conspiracy to tout, this time targeting Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, who has become a prominent public spokesperson during the outbreak. Two interviews in particular have been spreading rapidly on social media, prompting YouTube and Facebook to remove both video clips for spreading medical misinformation during a global pandemica violation of their current policies
In 2007, Mikovits met Robert Silverman at a conference. Silverman had co-discovered a retrovirus known as XMRV, closely related to a known virus from mice. He told her he had found XMRV sequences in specimens from prostate cancer patients, although other labs, using different sets of patients, could find no evidence of a viral infection. Nonetheless, this prompted Mikovits to use the same tools to look for XMRV in samples from patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)a disorder some had claimed was purely psychosomatic. 
In 2009, Mikovits co-authored the now-retracted Science paper, reporting evidence of a retrovirus associated with mice in samples from patients suffering from CFS, suggesting it might cause the condition. It was retracted after other laboratories failed to replicate the results, and subsequent tests revealed the original results to be the result of sample contamination.
But Mikovits refused to back down from her claims. She was fired as research director of the Whittlemore Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease for ""insubordination"" after refusing to supply a cell line used in her work to a former collaborator. In perhaps the strangest twist of all, Mikovits was briefly arrested after absconding with her lab notebooks and computer fileslegally the property of the institute.
This transformed Mikovits into a martyr for the cause in the eyes of many CFS sufferers, frustrated at having their disorder repeatedly dismissed and eager to latch onto a possible concrete biological cause. She became their champion, and their efforts to defend her sometimes turned dark. The most aggressive actions included bombarding researchers with freedom of information requests, lodging complaints with university ethics committees, and falsely accusing individual scientists of being paid by drug and insurance companies. Occasionally, there were even death threats. As Ars' John Timmer observed nine years ago:
It's no surprise that patients who frequently had their disorder treated with dismissiveness would respond positively to indications that it had a concrete, biological cause. But demonizing scientists who don't support something that appeals to you is never going to end well, especially when all indications are that the scientists are being careful and thorough. Unfortunately, we're now seeing more of this sort of behavior in areas as diverse as climate change, vaccine safety, and animal research.
Now Judy Mikovits is back as a patron saint of science denial. According to Retraction Watch, she spoke at the 2014 Autism One conference. Her talk included a slide with the self-aggrandizing title, ""The best scientist in jail story since Galileo."" Last month, she published a book with Autism One co-founder Kent Heckenlively. Like most authors, she has been aggressively promoting it, repeating all manner of outlandish claims in the process.
In addition to appearing in a 25-minute YouTube clip from a forthcoming antivaxx pseudo-""documentary"" called Plandemic, Mikovits was recently a guest on Patrick Bet-David's popular YouTube podcast. She claimed that the current pandemic is caused by a flu vaccine from the 2010s and that wearing a mask would somehow activate the coronavirus. She also claimed that Fauciwhom she blames for ""sabotaging"" her CFR researchshould be charged with treason. (Another attempt to smear Fauci with allegations of sexual assault backfired when the accuser had second thoughts and admitted she had been paid to make the accusation.)
This is all nonsense, of course. But the spread of these kinds of baseless conspiracy theories comes with a very real human cost. Not only has Fauci received death threats and been forced to beef up his personal security since he became a target, but other lives could be lost.
Retraction Watch has a useful list of its many posts following the Mikovits case, including the retractions, her arrest, and her unsuccessful lawsuit against her former employer. Noted health journalist Tara Haelle has a helpful list of science-based sources over at Forbes, debunking the specific claims made in the Plandemic clip, as well as tips for how to deal with friends or family members who share the video on social media. There's an ongoing debate about how best to deal with this kind of harmful misinformation: ignore it or try to debunk it? The jury is still out on the most effective defense. Haelle falls firmly on the latter side:
If you dont push back on them, even to those you love or dont want to upset, youre enabling them. Youre allowing people to spew harmful, dangerous nonsense that kills people and demoralizes the millions of health care providers trying to save lives. Many people try to avoid drama or debates on their social media accounts, and I respect that. But this video is not a time to agree to disagree because the stakes are too high. Its a matter of life and death. The false statements in this video can cause deaths.
Zubin Damania, a physician who hosts a YouTube channel as ZDoggMD, opted to forego the kinder, gentler approach Haelle advocates. He reluctantly addressed the Plandemic video at the request of viewers, expressing shock that anyone would be taken in by its easily debunked assertions, and that somehow the clip has racked up over one million views. ""The first five seconds of that video reeks of crazy sauce and no one can recognize that?"" he ranted. Dont waste your time watching it. Dont waste your time sharing it. Dont waste your time talking about it. I cant believe Im wasting my time doing this. But I just want to stop getting messages about it.
On the plus side, his impassioned three-minute rant has racked up more than two million views in two days. May it continue to be shared far and wide, even though it probably won't change the minds of hardcore conspiracy theorists.

A significant difference between COVID-19 and past pandemicseven the 2009 outbreak of H1N1has been the speed with which information on the disease has spread. Partly, that's down to social media, as platforms like Twitter have been embraced by scientists and doctors. But another major factor has been the rise of what we call a preprintan academic research paper that's posted to a publicly accessible server in advance of it having gone through the traditional process of peer review. When unvetted science that makes bold claims goes straight to the public, that can cause problems, as illustrated by a recent preprint on coronavirus mutations covered by John Timmer earlier today.
How things used to work
The traditional way that scientists share their findings has been through peer-reviewed journals. A scientistor more typically a team of scientistsconducts their research, writes up the results, and sends them to a journal that covers that particular field. (Or, if they want to make a bigger splash, a multidisciplinary publication like Nature or Science.) When the journal receives the paper, it sends copies out to be reviewed by (usually) three scientists that are also in the same fieldpeers of the authors. Those reviewers cast a highly critical eye upon the paper, looking for flaws in the methodology and analysis or other potential problems. Sometimes, they don't find any, and the paper sails through and shows up in print soon afterwards.
More commonly, one or more reviewers will find something they deem objectionable or insufficient. Each reviewer sends the journal editor their thoughts, often with questions or suggestions to pass on to the authors. Those will typically need to be addressed before the editor will accept the research for publication. Sometimes these are helpful, although not alwaysmany a scientist can tell tales of the mean and vindictive ""reviewer 3"" to keep their graduate students and postdocs up at night.The process isn't perfect, and it's invariably not quick, often taking weeks or months and multiple revisions between the initial submission to a journal and its eventual publication.
Whats a preprint?
That traditional model of peer-reviewed publishing isn't exactly new; in fact, it's hundreds of years old. But some time in the 1990s, researchers in the physics community decided to improve it. Since you can't really run a massive particle accelerator or experimental nuclear reactor with a couple of grad students and a single principal investigator, many physicists were already accustomed to working together on big collaborative projects and exchanging drafts of papers with the whole team. And so, embracing the still relatively new Internet, they created servers like arXivrepositories to share research publications that had yet to go through peer review and formal publication.
Instead of just sharing with their team, these researchers started sharing with the entire research community. Other scientists could read the research and discuss it with each other and the authors before the findings showed up in print, which led to the term ""preprint.""
The use of preprint servers and the transparency of a public (if unofficial) peer-review process was often a stick that physicists and computer scientists used to beat their biomedical colleagues with at meetings. Their implication was that biology was hopelessly behind the times. Over time, a new generation of disaffected biologists became more vocal with their dissatisfaction about the sclerotic nature of the traditional publication process. And so, led by genomics researcherswho, like their cousins in high-energy physics were also used to working in big multidisciplinary collaborative projectspreprint servers like biorXiv and medrXiv began to be created for biomedical science.
The attraction is obvious. Scientists can disseminate their findings much more rapidly, and young researchers can show funding bodies and hiring committees that they are being productive and contributing to the field while waiting for drafts to clear peer review. Publishing one's research on a preprint server also means that it's widely accessible, as opposed to locked behind a subscription paywall.
In just a few short years, the practice of using preprint servers in biomedical research has soared in popularity. A study conducted in 2019 showed a rapid increase in the number of papers uploaded to biorXiv over the first five years since it was created in 2014, as well as the rate at which new papers were deposited. There was an equally impressive increase in the number of downloads from biorXiv over that time. Encouragingly, the study also found that two-thirds of the preprints posted to biorXiv within its first four years were published in peer-reviewed journals. (The number is much lower when more recent submissions were included, clearly showing the lengthy time lag involved in getting a paper into print.)
So whats the problem?
Not every biomedical scientist is convinced about the rise of preprints in biomedical research (and in the interests of disclosure, I'm one of them). For some, their opposition has been due to policies at some journals that forbid any promotion of a research paper before it appears on their printed pages (or online at the journal's website, at any rate). That complaint has largely gone by the wayside as most journals have moved with the tide and altered their policies to exclude non-profit preprint servers from counting as prior publication.
Other scientists have voiced concerns that posting their work to a preprint server could allow rivals to race them to publication or beat them to the market. And othersand this is my particular fearworry about unpolished or even inaccurate work ending up in the hands of readers ill-equipped to evaluate it.
To put it more bluntly, if a paper posted to arXiv regarding a particular flavor of subatomic particle turns out to be erroneous or flawed, no one's going to die. But if a flawed research paper about a more contagious mutation of a virus in the middle of a global pandemic is reported on uncritically, then there really is the potential for harm.
Indeed, this is not an abstract fear. We are in the middle of a global pandemic, and a recent study in The Lancet found that much of the discussion (and even policymaking) about COVID-19's transmissibility (also known as R0) during January 2020 was driven by preprints rather than peer-reviewed literature.
Still, proponents of preprints will rightly point out that peer review isn't always perfect and plenty of papers that go through the traditional process are later shown to be problematic. As our article earlier today shows, scientists are aware of the differences, and Twitter has become a new outlet for conducting a very transparent form of peer review. The preprint genie is out of the bottle, and there are certainly good arguments to be made in favor of rapid dissemination of findings during a public health emergency like the one in which we find ourselves. But if you see a finding reported in the media from a preprint, perhaps treat it with one more grain of salt than usual."

The World Health Organization on Friday updated its guidance on the use of masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, making several changes and additions. Most notably, the agency is now recommending that governments encourage healthy members of the general public to wear masks in specific situations as part of comprehensive prevention efforts.
The new guidance puts the agency more in line with many countries worldwide that have already recommended masking the public, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which made the recommendation in early April.
However, the WHO made its updated guidance with many caveatsand some highly specific recommendations not provided by the US CDC.
I wish to be very clear that the guidance we are publishing today is an update of what we have been saying for months: that masks should only ever be used as part of a comprehensive strategy in the fight against COVID, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (Dr. Tedros) said in a press conference Friday.
Masks on their own will not protect you from COVID-19.
The technical guidance, released later Friday, is equally cautious, noting At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider.
Who and when
But, the WHOs decision to recommend masking the public was swayed by concerns that the disease spreads from infected people who dont show symptoms (pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission), according to the guidance. The agency also took into account individual values and preferences and the reality that physical distancing is difficult if not impossible in some contexts.
Last, the WHO emphasized that its updated guidance is based on fresh data and offers detailed technical advice on homemade mask construction.
This is new novel research, that WHO commissioned, that we didnt have a month ago, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOs technical lead on the COVID-19 response, said in the press conference Friday.
Specifically, WHO now recommends that healthy members of the public wear homemade or commercially-available fabric masks in places where the new coronavirus is circulating widely and where physical distancing (staying 6-feet apart, etc.) is not possible or is difficult.
Enlarge/ Who should wear a mask and when.
Detailed design
And those recommended masks arent just any face coverings. The agency looked over the filtration and breathability of a variety of common fabrics and materials. It noted that the French Standardization Association (AFNOR Group) has developed a technical standard for non-medical masks, which includes a minimum of 70 percent solid-particle filtration or droplet filtration.
The WHO noted that breathabilitythe difference in pressure across the mask as you breathe, reported in millibars (mbar) or Pascals (Pa)should be below 49 Pa/cm2 for a medical mask. But, for non-medical masks, an acceptable pressure difference should be below 100 Pa.
Last, the WHO calculated the filter quality factor, dubbed Q, which is a function of filtration and breathability, with higher values indicating better overall efficiency. The bare minimum for homemade fabric mask should be Q of 3, according to WHO expert consensus.
Next, the analysis turned to assembly of the maskthe best materials and layering method. Folding a single fabric into two layers can boost filtration two to five times. Folds making four layers boosts filtration up to seven times.
The WHO determined that a minimum of three layers is required for fabric masks. But, masks may need more, depending on the fabric used. For instance, folding cotton handkerchiefs into four layers still only led to maximum filtration efficiency of 13 percent, the WHO noted. Notably, the homemade masks recommended by the US CDC only have two or three layers of cotton.
Enlarge/ Analysis of potential mask materials.
With the lower standards even for the best homemade masks, the WHO stressed that these masks are for source control only, not personal protectionthat is, they can help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading the virus, but they will not necessarily protect the wearer from becoming infected. As such, its important that mask wearing should always be accompanied by frequent hand washing and physical distancing.
In all, the expert analysis landed on this mask design:
The ideal combination of material for non-medical masks should include three layers as follows: 1) an innermost layer of a hydrophilic material (e.g. cotton or cotton blends); 2), an outermost layer made of hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearers nose and mouth; 3) a middle hydrophobic layer of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets.
Van Kerkhove noted in the press conference that the evidence we have through this research is that, with those three layers and in that combination, that fabric [masks] can actually provide a mechanistic barrier. If someone were infected with COVID-19, it could prevent those droplets from going through and infecting someone else.
Enlarge/ Mask dos and don'ts.
The guidance didnt offer specific details on the testing of the recommended mask design or comparisons with others, such as those recommended by the CDC. Ars has reached out to WHO for additional data and will update this piece if it is available.
In addition to the fabric masks for public use, the WHO is also now recommending that in areas where COVID-19 is spreading, all healthcare worker always wear medical maskseven if they are not treating COVID-19 patients specifically.
And, in areas with COVID-19 spread, all people aged 60 years or over and anyone with an underlying health condition should wear a medical mask when physical distancing is not possible.
Last, the WHO offers advice on washing your mask and how to safely put it on and take it off.
Masks are not a replacement for physical distancing, hand hygiene, and other public health measures, Dr. Tedros said. Masks are only of benefit as part of a comprehensive approach in the fight against COVID-19. The cornerstone of the response in every country must be to find, isolate, test, and care for every case and to trace and quarantine every contact. That is what we know works. That is every countrys best defense against COVID-19."

Countries like the United States have never really gotten the pandemic under control, while others, like Brazil, haven't even slowed the pace of infections. But elsewhere, many countries that took dramatic action to limit the spread of COVID-19 have seen the rate of infections plunge, leaving them with the issue of how to successfully emerge from the restrictions they put in place.
One of those countries is Spain, where infections have dropped from a peak of over 9,000 a day in late March to only about 300 a day at present. Two researchers based in Barcelona (Leonardo López and Xavier Rodó) decided to look at different ways Spain could have exited its restrictions while protecting future public health. After building their model, they set it loose on other countries, including the US. Their work lets us test what might happen if the immunity developed in those infected fades over time or the public's fear of the virus subsides after it's under control.
Lockdown vs. open up
How did Spain get cases in check? In part, by following the advice of public health experts. On March 29, it placed everyone in non-essential jobs on a strict lockdown. Two weeks later, with cases dropping, restrictions started being eased. But the easing was done cautiously, with a variety of restrictions being kept in place as cases continued to drop. López and Rodó were interested in looking at how this reopening could be handled in a way that most effectively limits future returns of widespread infections.
To do so, they built an epidemiological model that was able to incorporate a variety of distinct factors. The foundation of their work was a standard susceptibleexposedinfectiousrecovered model, in which the population is moved among the above groups based on the spread of the virus. That spread is based on what we know of things like the virus' infectivity, how long people can spread it before and after developing symptoms, and so on.
López and Rodó added some critical features to this model. To begin with, it's able to handle the fact that some aspects of the virus' behavior aren't precisely definedour estimates of how long people are infective before symptoms appear are a bit rough, to give one example. So the authors added a probabilistic element, where the model could be run multiple times with uncertain values varied around their most likely values. This helps show how robust any result is by highlighting whether it's sensitive to small changes in things we're uncertain about.
To address the issue at hand, the researchers included an isolated population, which could not become infected. They acknowledge that this is obviously unrealistic, since some of the people in isolation will undoubtedly become infected. But they argue that it provides a low estimate while avoiding potentially alarmist results.
Finally, they include the ability to have some features of the pandemic and public health response vary over time. These include factors like a fading of the immunity that's been seen in other coronaviruses. In addition, they allow the degree of compliance with social-distancing rules to vary over time, as fears during periods of high infection will probably boost compliance initially, but fade over time. These factors influence existing pieces of the epidemiological model. For example, the fading of immunity would move people out of the ""recovered"" pool and back into the ""susceptible"" group, while fading of social-distancing compliance could be simulated by increasing the rate of new infections.
Finally, and critically for the research question here, the process of ending lockdown could be modeled directly as a time-varying process of moving more people out of the isolated population and into the susceptible one. This let them explore different rates of ending the lockdown, from an immediate, complete elimination of the isolated population to different fractions being removed over time.
Spain and beyond
The researchers started by initializing their model with the actual data from Spain, from the start of the pandemic up to its peak in that country. People were released from the confined group until the pre-pandemic working population of Spain was back in the susceptible group. The researchers modeled various dynamics for this ""deconfinement,"" ranging from letting everyone out immediately to gradually allowing increasing numbers of people back into the working population. They also varied the length of the lockdown period.
The results are about what you'd expect. The longer the lockdown lasted, the longer it took for a second peak of infections to occur. And a gradual release of the isolated population tended to delay the appearance of the new peak even further. (Spain's actual policy, which was also simulated, leaves it vulnerable to a a new peak in July, according to this model.) In the case of a 90-day lockdown and a gradual rate of release from isolation, the second wave was delayed to beyond the time scale of their study, which ended in early 2021.
In all cases, however, the number of deaths remained low, as one of the most vulnerable populationsthe elderlywas kept in isolation since they weren't part of Spain's pre-pandemic work force. The impact on deaths, however, was still reduced by shorter lockdowns and in scenarios where the release from isolation was immediate, rather than gradual.
The researchers then turned their attention to other countries. Indonesia was chosen because it doesn't have pronounced seasons, and Argentina because it is about to enter winter. Despite those differences, however, the model suggests a similar pattern of viral spread, with a second wave coming around January; sooner for shorter lockdowns, later for longer ones. For countries like Japan and New Zealand, however, the aggressive approach to handling the pandemic has left them in such good shape that there was no scenario in which a second wave occurred before 2021. If they did a longer lockdown and a more gradual reopening, the second wave might not arrive until nearly a year from now.
The big exception to all of this is the US. In the case of shorter lockdownswhich is what we've essentially done in many statesthe current rise grows to about 10 million infections before building to an enormous peak in late summer, with over 50 million infections. Longer lockdowns, at best, delay that to the winter and shave the peak by about 10 million. In short, even the best case of a hundred-day lockdown only stops the current peak and delays a resurgence so that it occurs around the same time as those in the worst cases for other countries.
Variations
López and Rodó also looked at some variations on the other interventions their model explored. They tried changing the number of people released from confinement during their gradual reopening. While they reasoned that they could put much of a country back to work by having two times the people outside confinement as there were inside, they found little difference between the results from that and the results when ten times more people were unconfined as remained isolated. So, as long as the release is gradual and the highest risk individuals are kept confined, it's possible to handle reopening safely.
This contrasts sharply with trying to alter the rate at which people are allowed out of the lockdown. Boosting the rate by a factor of 10 always produced a substantially higher second wave, regardless of how long the lockdown was for. The wave also arrived more quickly.
The researchers also modeled risk awareness by altering the rate at which the susceptible population took precautions that limited the spread of the virus, like maintaining social distancing and using face masks. They found that high levels of public awareness, when coupled with lockdowns and a gradual reopening process, was capable of blocking a second wave of pandemic entirely. The complete absence of these sorts of behaviors, in contrast, accelerated second waves so that they occurred earlier in 2020.
Next up, López and Rodó looked at the role immunity would play by allowing people from the recovered population to move back into the susceptible pool, testing rates that assumed everything from a short immune period of four months to one lasting a year. Not surprisingly, having longer periods of immunity could double the amount of time between subsequent waves of infection, and reduced the size of the peaks in each subsequent wave.
In summary...
Most of the findings here are consistent with work from other researchers. We're already fairly sure about issues like whether lockdowns are effective and how social distancing and face mask use limit the rate of the virus' spread. But López and Rodó put some quantitative weight behind the idea of gradual reopenings, which are being tried in a number of US states. ""Gradual deconfinement strategies always result in a lower number of infections and deaths,"" they conclude, ""when compared to the sudden release of moderate to large portions of the population.""
The other thing that is clear is that we're going to be engaged in an extended struggle with our own indifference and frustrations. ""The use of social distancing, face masks, gloves, and other individual protection measures has a massive impact in reducing the current peak of active cases,"" the authors write, ""but diminished awareness over time of the threats of the pandemic may result in a new larger second epidemic wave.""
The other thing that's clear from these models is that ending lockdowns while case numbers are still high is dangerous, and can extend the ongoing peak. In this case, the US seems determined to demonstrate that the predictions of the model are borne out by real-world data.

It's pretty quiet out there these days, particularly after you've gone to bed. But somewhere above, a pilot bathed in the glow of avionics is looking up from his instrument panel into the night. Behind him are 76 soft-sided coolers holding the physical data on which modern medicine dependssamples of blood, urine, and tissue from individuals around the country.
They're aboard a Pilatus PC-12 turboprop business aircraft, collected from airports where they've been delivered from laboratories, doctors' offices, and hospitals. The airplane is part of the 25-strong specimen-transport fleet of Quest Diagnostics, one of the two leading companies in the medical lab services market.
Quest pilots' mission to collect and transport this valuable cargo has the same goal every night: to gather the material and get it safely back to one of Quest's labs by 2am. That way, the lab results for the person from whom the specimen comes are available by 8am a day or two later.
There are remarkably few aircraft in the air over America at night in this time of COVID-19. Take a look at FlightRadar24.com or FlightAware.com at 10 or 11pm in the evening and you'll see.
Chances are, if you click on the icon of a small aircraft, it will have the identifier ""LBQ"" and the call-sign ""LabQuest. With each Quest PC-12 aloft in the darkened skies ride the hopes and anxieties of 76 patients waiting for results.
Always aloft
Quest aircraft have flown in empty skies before, on September 11, 2001, for example. ""We were just about the only ones in the air outside the government,"" Quest Senior Director of National Air Logistics Scott Gordon remembers. ""We actually ran under life-guard status on that day."" Quest airplanes were intercepted by fighters several times for positive identification, but they kept on moving specimens. That was well over a decade after the genesis of Quest's fleet.
It was launched in 1988 as part of the lab operation of the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham. In the beginning, pilots flew twin-engined Cessna 310s, though they were later joined by faster turboprop TBM 700 business aircraft. When SmithKline Beecham sold its lab operations to Quest Diagnostics in 1999, the specimen-transport fleet went with it.
By that time, demand for lab work and samples had grown so much that the company decided to acquire the PC-12, a larger Swiss-made single engine turboprop that can carry more cargo and cruise at 270 knots (310mph/500km/h) with excellent fuel efficiency. Today, Quest flies nine PC-12s along with nine Beech B58 Barons and five Embraer Phenom 100s.
Able to cruise at 200 knots (230mph/370km/h) at about 7,000 feet, the piston-twin Baron is suited to shorter flight legs, while the twin-jet Phenom 100 is more efficient on longer routes in the western US, cruising above 30,000 feet at 400 knots (460mph/740km/h).
Enlarge/ All three airplane types currently flown by Quest Diagnostics awaiting a night's work in the hangar. PC-12s sit forward at left and right by the door. Beech Barons are in the foreground at left and center. An Embraer Phenom 100 is in the foreground on the right.
But the PC-12 is likely the future of the Quest fleet. Its load capacity and middle-ground speed/altitude/fuel consumption qualities are encouraging the company to acquire more. It's a good fit in terms of size for an operation that's always assessing its efficiency, including the utilization of cargo space.
Well over a decade ago, Quest recognized that the traditional hard coolers it transported specimens in had a lot of ""empty air"" inside, Gordon says. ""So we went ahead and patented our own soft-sided coolers [in 2003]. That freed up about 50-percent capacity in all of our aircraft."" All specimens are packaged for the aircraft in the same sterile format, including the many COVID-19 specimens that Quest has been transporting to and from 12 different laboratory facilities during the crisis. Like more routine samples, they're managed with competition-like teamwork.
NASCAR at night
""It's like a NASCAR pit crew when we land. There's a ground team waiting for us, and there's a hand-off [of specimens],"" Gordon explains. Quest's pit stops (the aircraft make 88 daily landings in 63 domestic locations) often see planes simultaneously being re-fueled and unloaded/loaded while pilots do their next pre-takeoff checks and any flight plan updates. The company aims to ""turn"" each aircraft 20 minutes after it lands.
The broader process starts after daylight each morning. Maintenance crews show up at Quest's home airport in Reading, Pennsylvania, to inspect and/or repair the fleet, most of which returns each night. As they do so, Quest dispatchers in Tampa, Florida, are looking at the weather, the schedule, possible delays or diverts, and aircraft availability.
A conference call is joined at 2pm Eastern time by Quest's chiefs of maintenance and dispatch, its safety officer, chief pilot, and Scott Gordon himself. ""There's always something out there that we're assessing,"" he says. That could include forecasts for thunderstorms, Nor'easters, snow, or even hurricanes that could not only disrupt aircraft operations but broader logistics, from ground delivery vehicles to hospitals or labs.
Quest pilots generally arrive at the airport 30 to 40 minutes before their flights, around 5:30pm Eastern. They check in with dispatchers and walk to their aircraft to go through their pre-flight checks. The routes they fly are relatively standard, as are their flight plans, which are already loaded electronically into the airplane's avionics.
Each pilot consults a ""route sheet"" that shows the legs they'll fly round-trip and how many coolers will be placed in their aircraft for transport to a destination. Normally, the first departures from Quest's bases (also in Georgia, Texas, and Missouri) are empty of specimens. Pilots talk with maintainers about any issues or about weather/new stops with dispatchers, then roll out for takeoff with a plane full of empty coolers. If it sounds chill, it isn't.
Quest pilots fly single-pilot IFR (instrument flight rules) operations. These are demanding in any airplane, particularly at night in bad weather. Not surprisingly pilots are generally high-time multi-engine- or turbojet-qualified operators, usually with air transport certifications. ""It takes a special kind of pilot to do this,"" Gordon acknowledges. ""They're very skilled, but they're not looking to fly for the airlines and do a conventional job. They like the independence and the team atmosphere we try to build here. They're also home every night, which is pretty rare.""
On the way to Elmira, New York, or to Denver, Colorado, in the darkness, Quest pilots are well-known to the air traffic controllers who also work the third shift. When switching to a new frequency en route, pilots often recognize the voices of controllers they work with nightly and vice versa. ""We're very professional, and that translates to being treated well by the controllers,"" Gordon says. ""In our business, time matters, so any shortcuts or direct routing they can give us help a lot.""
Pilots check in with their dispatchers when landing at a destination, but they are masters of their own ships while flying their routes.
Specimens are people
Quest's pilots tend to stay put. The company includes a number who have been there for 20-plus years, including the pilot who made the first SmithKline Beecham specimen delivery flight 32 years ago. The flying challenge, personal latitude, and security of the job are appealing. But the sense of mission, even in more settled times, gives themand others within Quest's aviation departmentadditional motivation.
""Whether it's the pilots, maintainers, dispatchers, or even administrative people, they look at every specimen as a person,"" Gordon affirms. ""Patients are waiting on results, and some of them are critical to their health, to life and death. We keep that in perspective. It's a great thing to be a part of. That's why I think a lot of people have stayed with us.""
He adds that during the pandemic that feeling has been more pronounced, the work even more compelling.
By 2am, airplanes are returning to Reading and to Quest's other bases with full coolers. The specimens are handed off for ground transport. A few hospital-related flights will continue until about 11am. But most pilots are taxiing in, shutting down engines, switching off the avionics, andlike truckers or NORAD controllers taking a break until the sun comes up and goes back down. Then they'll appear, nightly as always."

Meat- and poultry-processing facilities have become hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks, with cases spreading in over 100 plants across the country.
Federal and state public health researchers reported Friday, May 1, that at least 115 meat and poultry plants in 19 states have had been affected by the pandemic. In all, the researchers counted at least 4,913 sickened workers and at least 20 deaths. The findings are likely an undercount given different testing strategies at facilities and the fact that some facilities did not submit any data.
For instance, the only data researchers had from Iowa indicated that only 377 workers in two plants in the state had been sickened. But on Tuesday, May 5, Iowa health officials announced that there were at least 1,653 cases from four plants that had outbreaksmeaning 10 percent or more of the workforce had been sickened.
A Tyson plant in Perry, Iowa, had 730 cases alone, which is 58 percent of tested workers at the facility. Iowa Premium Beef in Tama saw 258 cases, which is 39 percent of workers tested. A Tyson plant in Columbus Junction had 221 cases, 26 percent of those tested. Tysons Waterloo facility had 444 cases, 17 percent of tested employees.
The three Tyson plants closed for cleaning at various points in April. On Tuesday, the company said the Waterloo facility, which is still closed, will resume limited operation on May 7.
Safety problems
Our top priority is the health and safety of our team members, their loved ones and our communities, Tom Hart, plant manager of Tysons Waterloo facility, said in a statement. He noted that the facility had worked with local officials and health experts to better protect workers from the disease.
Keeping workers safe in meat processing facilities is a particular challenge, according to the researchers behind the study last week, which was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
According to data from risk assessments:
Facility challenges included structural and operational practices that made it difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance while working, especially on production lines, and in nonproduction settings during breaks and while entering and exiting facilities. The pace and physical demands of processing work made adherence to face covering recommendations difficult, with some workers observed covering only their mouths and frequently readjusting their face coverings while working. Some sites were also observed to have difficulty adhering to the heightened cleaning and disinfection guidance recommended for all worksites to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
The researchers also noted cultural and economic challenges to controlling disease spread in meat-processing facilities. For instance, one facility had workers who spoke 40 different primary languages. And many workers live in crowded, multigenerational settings and sometimes share transportation to and from work, contributing to increased risk for transmission of COVID-19 outside the facility itself.
For these reasons, they concluded that these facilities are at high risk of outbreak, which requires prompt action to decrease risks to workers, preserve facility function, and maintain the food supply.
Breaking the chain
Once COVID-19 begins spreading in a meat facility, it could easily become a source of infection for the greater communityor vice versa. Of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the highest new confirmed cases per capita, five have meat processing plants with outbreaks, The New York Times noted Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the United States has already begun experiencing shortages in certain meat products, including fresh beef, due to COVID-19-related closures and disruptions. Hundreds of Wendys fast-food restaurants have run out of hamburgers, and several grocery chains are limiting purchases of certain meat items, the Times reported Tuesday.
The chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page advertisements in the Times and The Washington Post last week warning that the supply chain is breaking.
To better protect meat-plant workers, the researchers behind the MMRW report made several recommendations, such as slowing down the pace of production, installing physical barriers between work stations, screening employees for symptoms, requiring masks, offering paid sick leave, and stepping up sanitation and hygiene stations.
However, workers have reported that meat companies have ignored health recommendations since the pandemic began, including failing to offer masks and other protective gear and encouraging people to work while sick.
According to an independent tally of COVID-19 cases in meat-plant workers by Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting, there have been at least 10,800 cases from 170 plants in 29 states, including 45 deaths as of May 6."

When cases of COVID-19 began popping up in Washington state in late February, researchers were quick to dive into the genetics of the viruses infecting residents. Based on what they knew at the time, they hypothesized that those cases in late February were genetically linked to the very first case found in the stateone in a person who arrived in Washington on January 15 after traveling from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. The case was also the first infection identified in the whole of the United States.
If correct, the genetic hypothesis linking the late February cases to that very first case meant that early efforts to contain the pandemic coronavirusisolating the initial patient, tracing contacts, etc.had failed spectacularly. It also meant that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, had been cryptically circulating in the state for six weeks. And that would mean that, in addition to those early cases, there were potentially hundreds or thousands of others out there, undetected and possibly spreading the infection further.
The hypothesis played into state officials decision to issue some of the countrys earliest social-distancing measures. But now that we know far more about the genetics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses, that hypothesis appears to be wrong.
At this point, researchers now have the full genetic blueprints of more than 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from patients. And with all that accumulated knowledge, a new analysis suggests that the cases detected in Washington in late February were not linked to that first case in January. Rather, the Evergreen States February outbreak was likely sparked by additional introductions of SARS-CoV-2 strains. The analysis pegs the igniting introduction to February 13, two weeks before the cases became apparent.
An important note: the new analysis is a preprint, which means it has not yet been published in a scientific journal or gone through the standard scientific vetting of peer review.
That said, several researchers accept the findingsgenerally, at least. And the analysis flows into a growing stream of cautions and corrections about genetic analyses done early in an emerging outbreak.
Origin story
Specifically, the type of analyses in question are phylogenetic, i.e., looking at genetic variation and evolution of individual organisms to understand how they relate to each other. All COVID-19 victims are infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, of course. But not all SARS-CoV-2 viruses are exactly the same. When a person is infected, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles get into cells of the body and hijack the cells molecular machinery to make viral copies of themselves, which can then go on to infect someone else. In all the frenetic viral cloning, there can be small errors in the copies of genetic code. And as virus particles move from person to person to person, the viral code can drift, accumulating new sets of mutations or picking up other variations.
By looking at the genetic sequences of many SARS-CoV-2 viruses and identifying the differences between them, geneticists can try to work out how they all relate to each other and how the virus is evolving overall. In doing so, researchers can also help understand the chains of transmission from person to person. For instance, if two patients are infected with viral strains that have very different sets of mutations, its unlikely one of them infected the other. If the viruses are nearly identical, its possiblethough not certainthe infections are linked.As for what those mutations might mean: sometimes theyre meaningless, sometimes theyre not. In the worst cases, they could allow a virus to cause more severe disease, for instance, or make it better at spreading between people.
So far, theres no firm evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is picking up scary mutations. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 doesnt seem to be evolving much at all. The scores of genetic sequences researchers have been gathering show that SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively slow rate of evolution.
That may be good news for humanity in general, but it is definitely bad news for making sense of phylogenetic data. The slow evolution means that many of the viruses look very similar to each other, making it hard to untangle how exactly theyre related. Thats what led researchers to suspect that the February cases of COVID-19 in Washington state were linked to the first case in January.
In the new analysisled by Michael Worobey, an expert in the evolution of pathogens at the University of Arizonaresearchers took a close look at the genetic data that has accumulated since the end of February. They note that, although the SARS-CoV-2 from the first Washington case, dubbed WA1, is very similar to the other SARS-CoV-2 viruses found in the state, they differ by two nucleotidesrepresented by letters in their genetic code.[D]espite hundreds of genomes sequenced in Washington state, no viruses with genomes identical to WA1 or transitional between it and the outbreak clade (i.e. having a C at position 17747 or an A at position 17858, like WA1) had been sampled there,"" the authors wrote.
To take things further, Worobey and colleagues set up simulations with the latest estimate for SARS-CoV-2s evolutionary ratethe rate at which it picks up such changes. In all their simulations seeded with WA1, none resulted in viral strains with the genetic changes similar to what was seen in the real outbreak viruses. Other modeling, however, strongly supported the possibility that additional introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington from China led to the outbreak in February. They estimated that another case arrived in the state on February 13, with a possible range of February 7 to February 19.
Viral threads
Though the analysis still needs thorough peer review, other researchers seemed to accept the general conclusion that additional introductions of SARS-CoV-2 likely led to Washington's outbreaknot the initial case in January.
That includes Trevor Bedford, the researcher who first hypothesized that WA1 was the source of the February outbreak in the state. Bedford, an expert in viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, conceded on Twitter that his hypothesis has not held up.
At this point, I dont think we can exclude a WA1 introduction as an impossibility, he wrote in a long thread on the topic. [B]ut I think the most likely scenario is a separate undetected introduction by a genetically identical virus or a virus possessing the additional 17858G mutation.
Bedford went on to say that he still estimates that there was a large, undetected outbreak at the time outbreak cases surfaced in late February. Thus, I believe I was wrong in the original assessment of a WA1 introduction, but correct in asserting significant community spread in Washington State on Feb 29, he wrote. Im sorry to have created confusion here. Although I do think that my original actions were warranted given available evidence at the time.
William Hanage, an epidemiologist and expert of pathogen evolution at Harvard, also agreed with the general takeaway of the analysis by Worobey and colleagues. It is now pretty clear that there were more introductions in Washington, he wrote in a Twitter thread responding to Bedfords comments.
Hanage and colleagues made a cautionary comment on just this issue in Nature Microbiology on May 19, before Worobeys analysis appeared online. Hanage and his colleagues wrote:
Most viruses can be separated into strains and, if two infections are caused by dissimilar strains, one can rule out transmission. The often-forgotten point is that phylogenies can rule out transmission, but if infections are caused by the same strains or identical viruses it does not definitively prove transmission. During an emerging outbreak when pathogens have not yet diverged into different strains, phylogenetic information is too weak to hypothesize transmission linkage...
Though the link between WA1 and Washingtons subsequent outbreak may be flimsy, there may be a silver lining in all of thisthat Washington state officials acted while thinking it might have a massive, hidden outbreak. As Worobey and co-authors note, Washington was among the first in the US to initiate restrictions on social distancing and size of gatherings.
One irony, they wrote, was that said action was founded at least in part on an assumption about the timing of community transmission not supported by the phylogenetic data (i.e. the belief that cryptic transmission had been ongoing since mid-January). This action may have closed the gap between the onset of sustained community transmission and mitigation measures in Washington state, compared to other locales like New York City, in ways that deserve careful reevaluation.
On March 22, when New York issued a stay-at-home order, the state was seeing over 17 newly confirmed cases a day per 100,000 people, according to IHME data. In April, that number hit as high as 52 new cases a day per 100,000.
On March 23, when Washington issued its stay-at-home order, the state was seeing about three new cases a day per 100,000and the figure has not reached above eight amid aggressive testing."

Was that a stinky DD coming from a big giraffe? Its definitely not coming from our 14 different pooper dooper locations!
Moments after stand-up comedian Meg Stalter drops this punchline, as part of a routine mocking the Disney Work Orientation process, her crowd of 11,400 viewers is silent. But shes not bombing. Stalter is streaming her comedy set via Instagram Live, and as soon as the joke drops, her audience members begin furiously tapping their phone screens, thus sending a wave of pink, yellow, and blue diaphanous hearts up from the right-hand side of her own livestreaming interface.
Im about to puke this is so funny, one fan types. Its not the immediate feedback of a laughing crowd, but for Stalter, shell take it.
Comedys current migration patterns
This is live comedy in the COVID-19 era: raucous laughter replaced by hearts, as audiences thousands of miles away tune in. Comedy has migrated to social media, including Instagram Live, Periscope, and Twitch, as well as networking platforms like Zoom. But these millions-strong platforms have something in common: they were never built with the particular nuances of live comedy in mind, and comedians are doing their best to adapt. I really miss all the energy of performing live, like the laughter, Stalter admits.
The relief of live, participatory comedy is perfectly suited for something like a pandemic, ripe with awkward interactions and collisions of social norms. Yet its one of the few types of performance that require audience reaction to know if the art is working. Most social networks limit their audiences to time-delayed emojis and text messages, while Zooms default audio mixing means any miced audience members can disrupt a performer pretty severely.
Stand-up performed to deafening silence is unsettling. When performing live, theres an immediate reaction: either its funny or its not, but [online] you dont know, comedian Noah Findling says.
Facebook Live and Instagram Live are trying to make their platforms more interactive, with features that allow performers to bring an audience member into their videos and incorporate live polls, says Addie Coronado, a communications manager at Facebook. Zoom, however, isnt adding new features that specifically target live performers requests, according to a representative. And stand-up comedians in need of a paying gigand eager to capitalize on entertainment-hungry fans sitting at homeare mostly forced to work within these popular platforms constraints instead of expecting fans to jump through hoops like installing or testing brand-new apps.
A two-way conversation
That hasnt stopped enterprising tech-comedy fans from experimenting.
Two months ago, a new platform called Rally debuted with its own ideas on simulating the comedy club experience online, complete with live audience laughter. Rally was launched by three Toronto-based designers with live-performance experience: Ali Jiwani, Amy Liu, and Anson Kao. The idea came about when Jiwani, a comedian, and Liu, a musician, struggled to make money from performing after the COVID-19 crisis hit in March.
How do we make it easier for everyone whos just like us to still perform and get their talent out when people arent [physically] coming together? Jiwani says. They also were frustrated with the lack of interactivity on many platforms, which particularly affected live comedy, which is a two-way conversation, Liu says. You cant just be taking to a screen to a group of muted individuals, she says.
Enlarge/ A mock-up of Rallys interface, as provided by its creators.
Within the Rally app, around 15 minutes before the show starts, participants are invited to pick a seat in a 2D interface filled with tables and chairs. Viewers can opt into a pre-show video chat with their table neighbors if they want, which is subtly encouraged by the audio of other viewers piped through everyones feeds.
Once the show begins, it largely resembles a Zoom video conference, with one major difference: the comedian is center stage, and the audience appears as icons whose voices are audible but at a much lower volume than the comedian. This addresses the default Zoom issue of when a laughing audience member ruins a comedians joke by having their face take over the screen. Rallys current interface also includes moderator tools: if an audience member becomes unruly, a moderator can boot them into a five-minute time-out. If they heckle again, they can be permanently kicked out.
Status update, via crowd banter
Rallys team says its trying to correct another one of the larger issues with live online performances: latency, or the time delay between a joke and the audience laughter. But Rally alleges that its latency is less than a secondthats roughly the same as Zoom, which can feel like an eternity when a performer relies on the rhythm of punchlines and laughter.
I watched one of the first Rally comedy shows last month, which featured performers in Toronto, San Francisco, and London. The lag wasnt too bad. I heard the toned-down laughter of other audience members, which didnt overwhelm the performers voices. It wasnt perfectone performers feed froze and had to be booted mid-actbut there was something great about hearing a comedian ask the audience, How many of you are single? and hearing multiple audience members reply, I am! in a way that didnt wrest mic control away from the comedian on stage.
A few audience members hung around afterwards to chat with comedians just as they would at a real-life comedy show. It seemed more similar to a comedy club than an Instagram Live show. I felt like I was part of an audience of real people, not of disembodied Instagram handles endlessly tossing up emojis.
Rallys founders claim theyve gotten interest from the agents of popular, touring comedians, but the companys incredibly limited online presence as of press time has us wondering if this experimental platform is built to scale up in a way that performers and audiences alike can easily access. (Cursory searches for Rally comedy on search engines and social media tends to bring up stories about political rallies, not a burgeoning live-performance interface.)
The 800 million-pound gorilla
One issue Rally will struggle to surmount is that comedians are flocking to where their audience already is. Facebooks last major public statement about daily active users came in March 2019, when it estimated a combined 800 million daily users on its Facebook Live and Instagram Live platforms; those numbers have likely grown in the 14 months since.
Some comedians seem to have successfully adapted to these platforms. Stalter, for one, has turned interacting with her audience into an art form. Recently, when she used a livestreamed performance to satirize the Home Shopping Network, Chelsea Peretti (Brooklyn 99) jumped into Stalters comments in character to sell the door to her home. Everybody was commenting to her and not listening to me, Stalter says, which the comedians were able to play off as a back-and-forth fight over video chat. The bit worked, latency be damned.
Findling has turned to more pre-recorded bits online, although he does some Instagram Live shows as well. Itd be really helpful to hear the audience [online], he says, not only because laughter lets him gauge what jokes are working but also because laughter is contagious. When you have a packed room, it makes people want to laugh more, because they can hear people laughing.""
But while Facebook has been bullish on letting users send real-world money to each other via its Messenger app, the company has not yet implemented this system in its livestreamed video platformsa curious omission, considering they can streamline the money-sending process and get a cut of that pie. [Comedians on Facebook] are not able to charge [audiences] through ticket sales, but thats how they make a living, Rallys Amy Liu says.
Amazons Twitch service is currently in the lead in this department with a range of built-in subscription and donation options, but that popular service has its own fatal flaw: latency. Even an unwieldy Zoom call, full of the laggiest international viewers you can think of, has a quicker audience-response capacity than Twitchs default, delayed-response system.
Its hard to imagine this report aging well, honestly. This many months into a pandemic, some performers may very well transition into more frequent livestreamed performances, particularly to tap into the online worlds unlimited crowd sizes, as opposed to cramped comedy clubs. And Hollywood is already eager to snap up the biggest streaming-exclusive hits of the pandemic, with John Krasinskis Some Good News turning into a CBS exclusive this past week. With momentum like that, a startup like Rally wont be alone in the space for long."

Now, the two companies are providing a first look at how the new technology will work on iPhones and Androids.
New screenshots published Monday show how the contact tracing software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert people if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
Apple and Google will push the new software to people's smartphones automatically later this month, and it's meant to be incorporated into COVID-19 apps developed by government health agencies across the globe.
It will be up to those agencies to decide how exactly to send people COVID-19 notifications using the technology, representatives for Apple and Google said during a press briefing Monday.
Experts predict that the technology will have to overcome a few major obstacles. One is minimizing the number of false positives — smartphones can detect Bluetooth signals through walls and from far away, and it's not clear how the apps will rule out those interactions. Another is verifying people's COVID-19 status to prevent trolls or misinformed people from falsely claiming to have the virus. Even more impactful is the limited scale of testing, which could mean many unreported cases of coronavirus.
Apple and Google are signaling that solving these problems will fall to public health agencies. The two companies said governments have been given the underlying app code to experiment with Bluetooth detection in the coming weeks, and user interface screenshots published Monday show an option for health agencies to input a unique ""Diagnosis Key"" to verify that someone has COVID-19.

Another camera could keep track of item stock on store shelves, while others could monitor the flow of foot traffic to determine shopping ""hot spots.""
To be clear, these image sensors won't replace the work of sophisticated cloud-based machine learning tools, which can go far beyond just recognizing objects. But they're a step towards a future where cameras can function more like self-contained computers.
And they can also assist more complex computer vision systems. For example, in a cashier-less store like Amazon's, where tons of video data is being captured and processed by a slew of cameras, Sony's sensors could detect exactly where customers are located. If nobody is by the milk aisle, there's no reason to flip those 3D cameras on, right?
Hanson tells us samples for the IMX500 have already been sent out to Sony's partners, while the IMX501, which is packaged to fit onto devices like smart boards, will start shipping in June. We can expect to see devices using the new hardware by the end of the year and throughout 2021."

At least in Japan, arcades are still prevalent enough for the fog gaming system to be viable. The company owns around 200 of them, and Sega machines are also prevalent in third-party arcades. 
The company's machines are connected to game center servers, which are also linked to the cloud. Many of them use the All.net platform, which is a backbone of online arcade competition, and also lets players track high scores, rankings and profiles across various game centers. But Ars Technica reports that non-Sega arcades are cutting ties with All.net because ""the fees make it untenable"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
It's not entirely clear whether Japanese players would be able to stream games directly from arcade machines. Famitsu suggests fog gaming would add minimal lag (less than 1 ms) on top of regular network latency, which could make that tenable -- especially for quick-reflex titles, such as fighting games. 
Players actively use arcade machines for eight hours or so a day, and the fog gaming system could give them the option to grind their favorite games outside of game center opening hours. Sega and other arcade operators would also be able to generate revenue from machines when the centers are closed.

More than 112,000 people have died from Covid-19 nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. 
The spike in numbers highlights how complicated it is to stop the spread of the virus despite early hotspots such as New York and New Jersey seeing improved numbers.
Since Memorial Day, the number of coronavirus hospitalizations has gone up in at least a dozen states, according to data CNN aggregated from the Covid Tracking Project between May 25 to June 9.

An additional 22 states are trending downward while nine others are holding steady.

""I think right now, most Americans are not ready to lock back down, and I completely understand that. Here's the bottom line, though, which is that -- I understand people are willing to live alongside this virus. It means that between 800 and 1,000 Americans are going to die every single day.

During that time, he reworked his snorkel mask into a reusable face shield for healthcare providers by combining it with a medical-grade filter. Dubbed the Pneumask, Prakash and his team tested the device and sent their findings to the FDA, which cleared it as a face shield or surgical mask, but not as a respirator. According to The Washington Post, this decision was made so that the masks could go out to healthcare workers immediately, as clearing the device as a respirator would require more time.
So far, Prakash’s team has created 1,500 masks and is sending them to frontline workers across five states. 7,000 more masks are in the pipeline and the team hopes to send out 50,000 Pneumasks. Prakash says that since the masks are reusable, healthcare workers can sterilize them and pass them onto other medical professionals who need them.

While UberEats has provided some relief, it’s not enough to make up for the drastic drop in ridesharing. Uber is now requiring riders and drivers to wear masks and developing tech to make sure drivers comply, but whether that will lead to more rides is hard to say.

Microsoft is being a little warier than other companies when it comes to welcoming consumers back to its retail stores. Just today, Apple announced it will offer curbside pickup or appointment-based service at over 70 more stores in the United States this week, including the Fifth Ave cube and other New York City locations. 9to5Mac has the full list. Best Buy has also continued bringing more stores back online as cities relax the guidelines put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
But Microsoft is still taking a wait-and-see approach, according to a statement provided to The Verge by email. Its stores remain closed until further notice. Our approach for re-opening Microsoft Store locations is measured and cautious, guided by monitoring global data, listening to public health and safety experts, and tracking local government restrictions, a spokesperson said. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and customers and have no new updates on store re-openings to share at this time. 
After closing the doors at its physical locations, Microsoft continued selling devices online and shifted the focus of retail employees to remote assistance for enterprise, small business, and education customers. And it has continued to offer virtual workshops for customers. 
Some of the companys latest products, like the Surface Headphones 2, Surface Go 2, and Surface Book 3, have been in high demand at authorized resellers. Microsoft Store locations have been closed since before the launch of this batch of products in May. 
Microsoft operates over 100 retail stores; the vast majority are in the United States, with a handful of stores in Canada and others in Australia, Puerto Rico, and the UK. The companys retail chain isnt quite as vital to its business as Apples, but Microsoft Store locations still serve as an important showcase for all things Surface, Xbox, and Windows. 
With COVID-19 still a very real threat to public health, retailers have implemented various safety measures as they reopen to help protect customers. These include social distancing, shortened operating hours, and requiring the use of face coverings for anyone who visits a store."

Researchers say Oura rings can predict COVID-19 symptoms three days early
With over 90 percent accuracy.
Researchers have combined biometrics from Oura rings with AI prediction models to detect COVID-19 symptoms up to three days early with, they claim, over 90 percent accuracy. It sounds pretty incredible, but the science isn’t just about wearing a bit of tech on your finger. The project asks participants to track stress, anxiety, memory and other psychological and cognitive biometrics in an app. The Oura ring collects physiological data, like body temperature, heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, respiratory rate and sleep patterns. It combines all of this with prediction models to suggest those that may have the virus, with high levels of accuracy.
The platform is currently being tested by more than 600 healthcare professionals and first responders, and the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute is working with partners like Thomas Jefferson University and Vanderbilt University to scale the test to include more than 10,000 participants.Continue reading.

Facebook staff plan 'virtual walkout' over response to Trump posts
Employees are angry at Zuckerberg’s decision.
Facebook employees are so upset with Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to take no action on Donald Trump’s posts on the social network that they are participating in a “virtual walkout” in a show of protest against the company. 
Facebook workers, most of whom are still working from home, are taking the day off and leaving messages that they are “out of the office in a show of protest,” according to a report from The New York Times.
It comes after Zuckerberg announced Friday evening that Trump’s posts, which Twitter said broke its rules regarding “glorification of violence,” didn’t violate Facebook’s standards. Axios later reported that Zuckerberg had spoken to Trump on the phone before announcing the decision. Zuckerberg announced Sunday night that Facebook would make a $10 million donation to “groups working on racial justice.”Continue reading.

 In the latest instance of unrest at the company, several thousand Amazon workers walked off the job Friday. The occasion was International Workers’ Day, also known as May Day, and the Amazonians joined workers at Instacart, FedEx, Target, and Walmart demanding better conditions for work that the government has deemed essential, and their own employers have frequently called heroic.
The protests to date have drawn attention to widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 in Amazon warehouses, the lack of protective equipment for warehouse personnel, and the low pay and draconian sick-leave policies that workers in fulfillment centers have endured for years. And they’ve been effective in at least two ways. One, Amazon increased pay and expanded sick leave as the pandemic spread. And two, as I noted here last month, they have created a sense of solidarity between Amazon’s fulfillment center workers and its white-collar workforce, which has increasingly been willing to speak out on their behalf.
Amazon played down the effectiveness of the walkout. “While there was tremendous media coverage of the protests we saw no measurable impact on operations,” the company told me. “Health and safety is our top priority and we expect to spend more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures.”
But on Monday, we saw one of the most striking acts of solidarity between Amazon workers to date. Tim Bray, a well known technologist who served as a vice president at Amazon Web Services and held the title of distinguished engineer, quit the company in protest of the treatment of his coworkers. In a scathing blog post, Bray accused Amazon of repeatedly firing warehouse workers on flimsy pretexts after they complained about working conditions in public. (Amazon denies retaliating against the employees.) Bray writes:

Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward. [...]

Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.


Bray’s cannonball of a blog post landed just days after Amazon, historically clumsy at public relations, had begun to show signs that it was reading the room. With more scrutiny developing around both its working conditions and its pandemic-related surge in revenue, the company took pains not to appear as if it were profiteering off the recession. Here’s Cameron Faulkner and Jacob Kastrenakes at The Verge:

Amazon expects to spend $4 billion or more — the predicted operating profit for the company’s entire coming quarter — just on COVID-19-related expenses. In a quarterly earnings release today, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the expenses will come from spending on personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning for facilities, “higher wages for hourly teams,” and expanding its own COVID-19 testing capabilities. [...]

Bezos’ note tries to make Amazon sound serious about “keeping employees safe,” telling shareholders to “take a seat” while the company ramps up this spending. “The best investment we can make is in the safety and well-being of our hundreds of thousands of employees,” Bezos writes.


This is the right thing to do, of course, even if it’s also in the company’s best interests. It’s notable to me less for the size of investment, however large, than for the way it acknowledges and responds to mounting external pressures on the company. For its first two decades, Amazon was able to evade sustained scrutiny by robotically repeating its mantra of “customer obsession.” In the COVID-19 era, the company has finally been forced to find some new words.
A series of investigative reports in the press and regulatory pressure from Congress have surely played their part in the shift. But the real pressure to change has come from Amazon’s own workers. Tech giants can’t stay ahead of their competition without a brilliant, motivated, mission-driven workforce — and brilliant, motivated, mission-driven people tend to be highly sensitive to the treatment of their coworkers. Amazon is yielding to its workers because, in this fraught moment, workers have real leverage.
Facebook learned this lesson in 2018. The Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, along with outrage over Russian interference on the platform during the 2016 US presidential election, ravaged internal morale. This, in turn, made it harder for Facebook to recruit — with acceptances of Facebook job offers dropping as much as 50 percent in 2019. And it led to a series of high-profile denunciations from company co-founders, early employees, and top executives. 
That’s what makes Bray’s exit so significant. It signals the arrival of a new moment in Amazon’s crisis — one of open dissent at the upper echelons of the company. Amazon famously asks employees on the losing end of an argument to “disagree and commit.” Bray suggests that at least on the subject of working conditions, high-level employees who disagree would rather clear out.

Pandemic
As the spread of COVID-19 has turned into the biggest story in the world, we’ve started to feel like it makes less sense to have a dedicated “pandemic” section. Instead we’re going to try sorting these stories as we did before — into stories that are about governance or about the industry — with an understanding that COVID-19 is the biggest force shaping those stories in the moment. We welcome any feedback you have on this change.
Governing
⭐ Apple and Google shared sample interface designs of what their automatic exposure notification system could look like. The designs are intended for developers, and show how specific alerts would appear and when particular API calls should be made. Russell Brandom at The Verge has the story:

The companies also laid out six specific principles that public-sector partners would be expected to uphold. Most notably, the apps can only be used for COVID-19 response efforts, will be restricted from using Location Services, and require opt-in consent before accessing the API or sharing a positive diagnosis. They also will not allow any form of targeted advertising in the resulting apps; any existing apps using targeted advertising or location services will need to turn off those systems before they access the API.

In one new twist, the companies plan to restrict access to a single app per country in an effort to avoid fragmentation. But the wording of the principle leaves the door open for countries like the US where the response has been led by states.


Here’s how contact tracing apps are developing around the world. Governments and technology companies are embracing the apps as a way to fight COVID-19. Here’s a good overview of the various attempts. (Gerrit De Vynck / Bloomberg)
The United Nations announced a new social distancing app designed to help alert people when they get too close to another person during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But the app is barely functional, and doesn’t perform the most basic of tasks. (Joseph Cox / Vice)
A group of Senate Republicans is planning to introduce a privacy bill that would regulate the data collected by coronavirus contact tracing apps. Unfortunately, the plan doesn’t make a lot of sense. One expert called it “a privacy ‘cure’ worse than the disease,” and said it amounted to “deregulation disguised as consumer protection.” (Kim Lyons / The Verge)
⭐ Extremists are trying to turn the coronavirus pandemic into a powerful recruiting tool in the deep corners of the internet and on the streets of state capitals. They’re using the public health crisis to bolster their white supremacist, anti-government agenda. Here’s Neil MacFarquhar at The New York Times:

What success the groups have had in finding fresh recruits is not yet clear, but new research indicates a significant jump in people consuming extremist material while under lockdown. Various violent incidents have been linked to white supremacist or anti-government perpetrators enraged over aspects of the pandemic.

The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said in March that white supremacists have encouraged followers to conduct attacks during the crisis to incite fear and target ethnic minorities and immigrants. “We have noticed domestic extremist groups taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic by spreading disinformation,” Jared M. Maples, its director, said in a statement. The coronavirus has been dismissed as a hoax, painted as a Jewish-run conspiracy and, alternatively, described as a disease spread by nonwhite immigrants, he said.


Facebook has started to crack down on the anti-quarantine activists, taking down content that advocates violations of social-distancing guidelines. And so protesters are moving their organizing efforts to MeWe, a social media platform that says it prides itself on user privacy. (Paige Leskin / Business Insider)
Rep. Adam Schiff, (D-CA), asked the CEOs of Google, YouTube and Twitter to follow Facebook’s lead on coronavirus misinformation policies. I imagine this led to a lot of high-fiving on the Facebook policy team. (Lauren Feiner / CNBC)
Facebook’s plan to combat misinformation on the platform could be more effective if it actually tells people what misleading news they’ve interacted with. The co-author of one of the studies Facebook cited in its current strategy said retractions were more effective in correcting misinformation when they explicitly repeated the original falsehood.

Protests against coronavirus-related shelter-in-place restrictions continued to spread last week, organized on social media. The demonstrations have brought together a coalition of gun activists, vaccine opponents and anxious business owners. (Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Moriah Balingit / The Washington Post)
The Bay Area has six criteria for loosening shelter-in-place restrictions. Here’s where each county is now. Some criteria are already being met, like new cases and hospitalizations staying flat. Others, like testing, are close. (Erin Allday / San Francisco Chronicle)
Three counties in California have announced they’re reopening nonessential businesses in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide restrictions. Modoc County was the first to make the move, announcing it would reopen restaurants, bars, and churches. (Zeeshan Aleem / Vox)
After a single tweet, New York state paid a Silicon Valley engineer $69.1 million for ventilators that never materialized. The engineer, who has no apparent background in government contracting or medical devices, was apparently recommended by the White House. (Rosalind Adams and Ken Bensinger / BuzzFeed)
The coronavirus’s economic wreckage is going to make tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon even more dominant. But it also increases the risk of an antitrust collision with Washington. (Steven Overly and Leah Nylen / Politico)
Speaking of which: House lawmakers investigating Amazon for antitrust violations called on Jeff Bezos to testify at an upcoming hearing. The escalation between the company and members of Congress follows reports that Amazon employees used data from third-party sellers to launch its own competing products. (Tony Romm and Jay Greene / The Washington Post)
Chinese propaganda about COVID-19 is growing. To combat the spread of misinformation, experts say social media platforms should stop allowing paid political advertisements from media outlets registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They should also consider banning state media accounts run by countries that block their own citizens from accessing the platforms. (Vanessa Molter, Renee DiResta and Alex Stamos / The Washington Post)
YouTube deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s channel from its platform. The company had repeatedly warning the popular creator that he had violated its policies by posting misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic.
Poynter Institute, a non-profit organization, launched a WhatsApp chatbot to debunk coronavirus-related hoaxes. The bot relies on information from over 100 independent fact-checkers in more than 70 countries. (Manish Singh / TechCrunch)
Joe Biden’s campaign has the daunting task of trying to make the 77-year-old candidate go viral on social media. The digital team is committed to staying away from the combative tone of President Trump, opting instead for a feel good strategy. But social media platforms tend to amplify conflict.

TikTok has a new lobbyist tasked with changing its reputation in Washington. Michael Beckerman’s job is to persuade Congress that TikTok is a trustworthy social media platform that helps families bond and gives users authoritative health information.
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has become the prime liaison between Silicon Valley and the national security community. He sits on two government advisory boards aimed at jump starting technological innovation at the Defense Department, and is focused on revamping America’s defense forces with more engineers, more software and more AI.

Industry
Facebook has started to reopen some of its content moderation centers and allow contractors to return to work if they want to. Employees will have their temperatures checked at the beginning of their shift and buildings will be deep-cleaned at the end of shifts. (BBC)
Facebook might lose its accreditation from the Media Rating Council, which gives companies confidence they are getting what they pay for when it comes to advertising on the platform. The council said Facebook failed to address advertiser concerns related to how it measures and reports data about video ads, among other things. (Jeff Horwitz and Suzanne Vranica / The Wall Street Journal)
Amazon told thousands of employees in Seattle and Bellevue that they can continue to work from home until at least October. The guidance applies to “employees who work in a role that can effectively be done from home.” (Benjamin Romano / The Seattle Times)
Twitter usage spiked to 166 million daily users in the first quarter of 2020, the largest growth the company has ever reported year-over-year. The increase in traffic still wasn’t enough to offset the sudden advertising decline caused by the pandemic. (Jacob Kastrenakes / The Verge)
Zoom doesn’t actually have 300 million daily active users as it previously claimed. The company admitted the mistake and edited references to say it actually has “300 million daily Zoom meeting participants” — a significant difference. (Tom Warren / The Verge)

A day after Reddit announced it was introducing built-in subreddit chat rooms, the company rolled back the feature due to a site-wide bug. The platform’s vice president of product and community said Reddit had “made several errors” in the process of releasing the feature. (Monica Chin / The Verge)
TikTok is toying with the idea of producing a reality TV show. The move would be part of a push to broaden the app’s appeal and showcase different ways of using its videos. (Lucas Shaw / Bloomberg)
Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, wrote an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times about how film production can “safely resume in a COVID-19 world.” It varies heavily by locale, but the key seems to be available testing for cast and crew members.

Public schools in Montgomery County, Va., last week became the first in the world to offer a library book drone delivery service. The ideaallowing kids to access titles even when the library was closed due to novel coronaviruscame from Kelly Passek, a Blacksburg Middle School librarian and one of the original Wing drone delivery customers.
""Access to school library resources is essential for the success of our students,"" Passek said in a statement published on the Wing blog. ""The MCPS-Wing partnership allows us the most unique way to continue to provide that access so that our students are able to stay engaged with independent reading and continue on their path of success even during this time of social distancing.""
During the limited trial run, eligible Montgomery County Public School students can request any book from a catalog of more than 150,000 titles, then have it delivered by drone to their yardfor free.
Wing Aviation, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, last year became the first drone delivery company to receive an air carrier certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. In October, it began transporting FedEx and Walgreens packages to consumers in Christiansburg, Va.

Now, the London-based cellist is spending quarantine arranging elaborate covers of pop culture classics for her YouTube channel including, most recently, the Knight Rider theme.
For those not immersed in the world of cult NBC dramas from the 1980s, Knight Rider stars David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight, a man who fights crime with the help of his nearly indestructible and sort-of sentient car, KITT. The show also boasts an ultra-catchy theme song, which Ginsberg's arrangement gives an extra layer of drama and camp. 
Ginsberg had toyed with the idea of multitracking on cello for a while, but quarantine provided an opportunity to finally pull the trigger. 
""Cello is the perfect instrument for multitracking because of its massive range over 4 octaves in pitch and a huge variety of different timbres and articulations,"" she explained via email. ""I'd had the idea ... in the back of my mind literally for years, but never found the time to do it until now.""
Knight Rider is Ginsberg's third foray into cello multitracking in recent weeks. Her first was a cover of the Inspector Gadget theme, which she recorded in one take using the app Acapella. (You've probably seen quite a few Acapella videos before.) 
SEE ALSO: The power of games and play during times of crisis
She also used Acapella for her ""Imperial March"" video, which she recorded while wearing a Darth Vader mask. The mask impaired her sight, though, which made getting complete takes difficult. So she decided to change her approach. For the Knight Rider video, Ginsberg first created the arrangement by ear in about an hour, she says then recorded audio in Logic Pro and video on her phone. Next, she ""stitched everything together"" using Final Cut Pro.
""This sounds simple, but until this week I had never done any video editing of any kind and it took ages!"" she said. ""I expect the next one will go a lot more smoothly.""
Ginsberg'swork has gotten quite a bit of praise on the r/videos subreddit, particularly from Knight Rider fans, of which there seem to be a startling but not altogether surprising number. ""This so super cool and Id legit listen to an entire album of '80s TV theme music,"" wrote one commenter. 
As for what hot tracks we can expect from the cellist next, she says she gets lots of requests but doesn't want to make any promises. She does plan, however, to give the people what they want: nostalgia. 
""For the time being I'm going to concentrate on retro TV, cartoon, movie and video game themes as they're fun and people really seem to enjoy them,"" she said. ""I think at such a difficult, stressful time, people are really responding to content that takes them back to their childhoods.""
Despite her videos' fun, effortless ethos, Ginsberg underscored that because she's self-quarantining, she's had to learn a lot of new skills to make her projects work. 
SEE ALSO: How the pandemic will change our relationship to time forever
""In my everyday pre-quarantine life as a session musician I don't really do anything except turn up to the studio, play the sheet music that's put in front of me, and leave the technical side to other people,"" she said. ""The only way I can work for the foreseeable future, whether on my own projects or on remote recording for external clients, is by doing everything myself.""
""It's been an incredibly steep learning curve and has confirmed something I've always suspected,"" she added. ""Producers, studio engineers and sound technicians don't get nearly enough credit for what they do."""

That reality presents a whole host of complications to everyday life. One major issue: How do we educate our kids?
The initial spike in COVID-19 cases this spring forced nearly all classes to move online. Parents had to pivot overnight to being educators for their kids. Teachers had to make dramatic shifts in how they do things. That reality left folks across the country scrambling for resources.
A surge of new customers soon flooded the online lesson plan market. A lesson plan marketis exactly what it sounds like: think Etsy or Amazon but for school resources. Teachers Pay Teachers
 (TPT) is the most popular such site a place where teacher-sellers can offer their lesson plans and resources and it's had a massive uptick in business since the pandemic hit. 
In data provided to Mashable, TPT reported it saw a 20 percent increase in weekly spending per buyer, year over year. Searches for distance learning shot up 1,400 percent at its peak in mid-to-late March. 
""Teachers in the last couple of months have been dealing with more issues than they normally do,"" Joe Holland, TPTs CEO, said in a phone interview. Teaching kids in a distance learning environment is incredibly challenging."" 
""Teaching kids in a distance learning environment is incredibly challenging."" 
But lesson plans and resources that work in a traditional classroom don't always cut it in a virtual learning environment. 
""I have seen firsthand a number of teachers who said, 'You know what, this is my original thing that I created for this class I see that a certain number of kids just aren't getting it and I'm not there [to help]. How do I use technology and more resources to differentiate and meet [kids'] specific needs?'"" Holland said. 
The lesson plan marketplace can be lucrative the market is worth tens of millions
. According to TPT, it had more than 6.5 million unique users in the last year and more than 150,000 sellers. It can also make teacher-authors serious cash. As Mashable wrote in 2012
, one kindergarten teacher earned $700,000 in just on year selling plans. 
Megan Polk, a seller on TPT who has taught for 14 years, said what started as a side-hustle five years ago has now turned into a business that far surpasses her teacher salary. In an interview, Polk, who works as a reading interventionist at a school in Houston, described the rush for teachers (and sellers) to quickly shift to digital resources when the pandemic hit and schools went remote.
""I quickly tried to think about some of my best sellers or favorites, making them digital, [and] offering those as like free updates,"" Polk said. ""It kind of took me out of the way of like 'Im out here to make a dollar'  because we knew how much teachers were struggling.""
Polk's TPT store.

Polk isnt the only seller to quickly shift gears and move towards resources intended use on a device. Typically, you might see printable worksheets, classroom decorations, or physical materials (like pre-made posters) to help engage students. Many of those items are not much good when no one is physically together. 
So when the pandemic hit, TPT created a tool that would allow teacher-authors to convert printable resources into digital PDFs. According to the company, around 30 to 35 percent of newly created resources have been digital during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, that figure was just 10 percent. 
But Polk also said she had to think about creating resources for teachers with students who might not have access to lots of technology.
""So my real shift went to thinking about, OK, this is how you can use the printable resources you have,"" Polk said. She took videos and photos of herself that would basically walk teachers through how she would do a lesson.
Thats a real struggle teachers have faced during this time: How do you get students to learn while youre not in the same room.
""It's going to be a continual challenge for these teachers, it's going to be a job continually harder than it even always has been,"" said Holland, TPT CEO. ""And we expect that we're going to continue to adapt with teachers to figure out now to meet their needs."" 
""No one knows exactly when and how this pandemic will end, but we do know that creative, dedicated educators are adapting quickly to reach and teach students and support families through this crisis."" - Michelle Cummings, VP of Content at TpT https://t.co/XcXxhD0rKapic.twitter.com/lyftwkbmRn

Dr. Vicki Jacobs, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education
, described the challenge of engaging students while making sure their socio-emotional needs are being met during a crisis. And while some in education have been squeamish about lesson plan marketplaces what if teachers are using it to shirk their responsibilities Dr. Jacobs said the real issue is making sure educators use every resource with a well-defined end-goal in mind. 
""Buying lesson plans and curriculum, to me the challenge is to figure out whether or not they serve your purposes. The purposes have got to come first,"" Dr. Jacobs said in a phone interview.   
In essence, teachers need to have a plan for the lesson plans beyond having a resource from a website that looks neat. 
""We just need to make sure that kids are safe and cared for, and don't lose those school connections.""
""A good, and usually seasoned, teacher has the intuition to say, I want my students to get to Point A. I want them to learn and I want to use this kind of learning,"" Dr. Jacobs said. ""So then I can go and take a look at what I might borrow in terms of activities or whatever in these plans that will support my intentionality.""
But these days you know, with there being no actual classrooms teachers arent the only instructors. Parents and guardians have had to step-in and act as de-facto teaching assistants. They've also had to figure out how to help educate their kids while also, in many cases, working full time, putting food on the table, and juggling the many other stresses of a pandemic. Its a lot. 
Laura Collins, principal of the elementary program at the Stanley G. Falk School in Buffalo, New York, has said handout and physical materials pulled from TPT  have proven really useful for parents. Collins school is a relatively small, special education school, which means theyve actually been able to drive around and pass out physical worksheets to students families. 
""I think that's been a huge thing that parents have been the most grateful for,"" Collins said in an interview. ""Because oftentimes, if you have one child or two children from the feedback I've gotten parents are quite overwhelmed with the online learning. So to maybe be able to work with one child on the computer, while the other child's doing some kind of experiment, or something that they can work on more independently, has been really helpful to parents.
That's likely one of the many reasons that some parents are taking things into their own hands and buying these teaching materials themselves. According to TPT data, the number of parents joining the platform doubled at its peak in mid-to-late March. That makes sense. If you're suddenly running a homeschool out of your kitchen, then you're likely going to want materials from educators who have years of experience. 
TPT, or any single resource, isnt solving the massive challenges presented by the coronavirus crisis. But its become an important instrument in a toolbox for parents and educators who are doing their best to approximate a normal learning environment.
""We just need to make sure that kids are safe and cared for, and don't lose those school connections,"" Collins said."

Zuckerberg said the company has been removing content that's likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm."" 
""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. 
Still, he said he wanted to allow the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression. Facebook made a similar argument when defending its controversial decision to allow politicians to lie in their Facebook ads. 
Facebook was widely criticized over its role in the 2016 presidential election, when Russian trolls leveraged the platform to spread fake news. We're in an election year once again, but, according to Zuckerberg, Facebook is far better prepared this time.

Executives announced in a company blog Monday that Twitter would start affixing labels and warnings to tweets containing information about COVID-19 that goes against the advice and knowledge of public health experts. That will include tweets where the misinformation is contained in media, like videos and images.
Twitter previously announced that it would label or remove misinformation that could cause physical harm or widespread panic, including conspiracy theories. Monday's announcement broadens the policy to content where harm is not as obviously imminent. 
Other misinformation will get a label with a link out to more resources.

An important clarification to the policy came on Twitter shortly after the post. In response to questions from reporters, Twitter executive Yoel Roth clarified that the company's new policy would apply to the tweets and content of world leaders  including President Trump.
This is an important clarification because Twitter has been inconsistent in applying its content policies to President Trump in the past. Additionally, Trump has lied and spread misinformation about coronavirus cures, treatments, and progress. 
These labels will apply to anyone sharing misleading information that meets the requirements of our policy, including world leaders.
 Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) May 11, 2020
Flagging misinformation will take three forms on Twitter. It could be removed if the information is egregious and could cause real world harm. Twitter could gray out the Tweet or content and affix a warning label if the content contains a ""disputed claim"" and the potential for harm is ""severe."" Or it could get a label which is basically a line of text linking out to other information if the information is misleading our disputed, but the potential for harm is ""moderate."" Here's a handy graph.
Making distinctions between bad, worse, and life threatening? Love that for us.
Image: twitter
It's not clear how Twitter will find the tweets that it labels or affixes warnings to. In a section found within the post called ""How will we identify these Tweets?,"" Twitter says it will use ""internal systems to proactively monitor content related to COVID-19,"" as well as ""rely on trusted partners"" for assessing the risk level of tweets. Not exactly transparent.

For me, that desire to take my foot off the accelerator usually came when I had an inkling that I quite liked a person. That, of course, was accompanied by a faint glimmer of hope that this person could turn into someone important to me.
In the words of Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, everything has changed. The proverbial dating rule book is out of the window and most of us are now just making it up as we go along. Some couples are falling in love in lockdown without seeing each other in person. Some made the bold move to move in together at the start of the pandemic. And others are forming ""support bubbles"" with newfound loves. 
Living through this moment in history is already changing our relationship to time. Some couples are taking it slow physically, but hurtling full steam ahead emotionally. Others are treating their Tinder matches like pen pals and taking things at a pace that can be described as glacial. Others are going full steam ahead on both those counts. 
According to a new report from dating site eharmony and relationship support charity Relate on relationships in lockdown, over a third of people newly living with a partner feel the past two months are the equivalent of two years of commitment. More than 59 percent of new couples feel more committed to their partner in the wake of the pandemic, creating a wave of ""turbo relationships,"" and 36 percent say they've hit common relationship milestones, like moving in together, much quicker. And this cranking up a notch of relationships has also led to more sex for 23 percent of couples.

""Make no mistake, we are living in historic times, with a pandemic and the resulting lockdown having a profound impact on the way we live and love,"" said eharmony relationship expert Rachael Lloyd. ""Whats really interesting, is the creation of so-called turbo relationships whereby couples whod never usually move at such speed may have found themselves living together within weeks of meeting and largely thriving.""
I spoke to couples who have experienced this new wave of accelerated romance in their relationships during the pandemic. 
Gabrielle, who prefers not to reveal her real name, got out of a five-year relationship in December and found lockdown really hard. She was living alone for the very first time and going through a tough breakup. She described it to me as a ""very confusing, horrible period."" During lockdown, her ex confirmed to her that he didn't want to get back together. 
She downloaded Hinge and went on her first socially distanced date on the balcony of her flat. This was around the time the UK government announced ""support bubbles"" where people living alone can go and stay with someone else who's also living alone. 
""He said, 'I think we're going to get married.'"" 
During that first date, Gabrielle and her date kissed. ""I remember freaking out that I kissed someone,"" she said. ""I had to tell my mum."" Gabrielle then did something she wouldn't usually do on a first date, she asked him if he wanted someone to kiss and cuddle during lockdown. He said yes. ""You can be my bubble,"" he told her. 
""We made some rules at the start,"" Gabrielle explained. ""I was like, 'If you kiss or hug someone, you have to tell me, then we have to stay apart for two weeks.'"" Gabrielle's date (for want of a better term) has been to her house seven nights running and a few of those nights have involved sleepovers. ""I feel like in the space of a week Ive had an entire relationship,"" she told me. In that week, they've spent the majority of their time in her living room, sitting on her sofa drinking wine. She's never actually been outside with him. ""Lockdown has accelerated everything so quickly,"" she told me. ""If you can only touch one person, then it intensifies things very quickly."" 
But, despite the relationship's secret, behind-closed-doors-ness, Gabrielle says it feels quite romantic. ""I kind of feel like were married,"" she told me. ""And when I told him that, he said 'I think we're going to get married.'"" This romance over wine and Gü Puds
 has been an unexpected pleasure for Gabrielle albeit an intense one. ""Being exclusive from the moment you kiss just makes you give things a proper chance,"" she said. ""I feel like were in a world of our own. We're suspended in time a little bit.""
Lauren, who prefers to not reveal her real name, reconnected with a guy she fancied when she was in sixth form about a week before the UK went into lockdown. Because of the timing of their reconnection, they weren't able to go on a date. But they've been getting to know each other from afar. ""Over the past three months we have been sending voice notes back and forth (about 50 mins a day each),"" she said. ""I feel very invested in the relationship now, and wouldn't talk to anyone else, which is odd as technically we've not even been on a first date!"" For Lauren, this is the longest she's ever spoken to someone without meeting up with them. ""Could be a good thing!"" she said.
Asked if she's developed feelings for the guy in question, Lauren said she definitely has. ""I'd be pretty upset if for some reason he didn't want to meet anymore,"" she added. And her former sixth form crush has said the same. ""I think there's a bit of an unspoken agreement to mention the date every now and again so that we both know we're still planning on going.""
The question many lockdown lovers have right now is: What if we don't fancy each other when we finally meet up? I asked Lauren if she was concerned about this small detail. ""I am a little bit!"" she said. ""We bumped into each other at the train station just before the lockdown which is how it started and definitely fancied him then."" 
When it comes to ""turbo relationships,"" not all of them prove to be great whirlwind romances, though. Take Anna, for instance. A guy she'd been on three dates with had a fluke electrical fire at his apartment right at the start of the COVID restrictions coming into place in the U.S. ""I had some extra space so decided to take a risk/take advantage of the universe kicking him out of his place and invited him to stay with me,"" Anna explained. It was mid-March by that point and a two-week stay-at-home order had just been announced, soon to become an extended to ban all non-essential travel. ""It soon became clear that he would be there indefinitely,"" she said. 
""It turned out to be kind of like roommates with benefits.""
""It turned out to be kind of like roommates with benefits,"" she explained. ""We didnt know each other well, so it was a crash course in all the practical things about living together along side all the dating stuff. Like, what are your eating habits? Night owl or early riser? What shows interest you? How clean are you? Do I still like him in close quarters? Am I attracted to him (this I knew before)? What are his values and hobbies?"" Her roommate-slash-friends-with-benefits left after four weeks because of a family emergency. ""Overall I think it was a best case scenario we didnt fall in love but are still in touch and seeing each other,"" she said. ""We got a bunch of stuff out of the way and know were pretty compatible something that normally takes months not weeks. Also from a practical perspective I know hes respectful of space, personal boundaries, and loves my cats.""
Ultimately, moving in with someone you've only been on three dates with was a big step for Anna. ""As a devoted introvert who lives alone it was a big struggle for me at first to figure out how to divide my time between work, hanging out with him, and also keeping up some alone time with things like reading, but the good news was that through that, I knew that I didnt want him to leave,"" she said.
Stephanie Healy moved in with her partner two days before lockdown was announced in the UK. They'd been dating since Feb. 2019 and until this point, she'd been vocal about not wanting to move in. Making the decision to move in, she has been living out of one bag for the entirety of the government's stay-at-home restrictions. ""It was make or break really,"" she said. ""And now that Im here, I genuinely couldnt imagine being anywhere else. 
""Id been holding off on it because it freaked me out (avoidant attachment over here!), and we agreed Id stay at his for a few weeks whilst I continued renting my old flat to see how it went,"" she explained. ""Then lockdown happened, and I couldnt go back because my housemates were vulnerable."" In the absence of being able to leave and have her own space in her newfound living arrangement, Healy found she needed to get better at communicating. She's no longer living out of a suitcase either after moving all her things across last weekend, and says moving in with her partner has definitely solidified their relationship. 
In many respects, life has slowed down in lockdown. But for some of us, that slowing down has prompted other aspects of our lives to speed up. For some, it meant taking their relationship to the next level. For others, it meant finally accepting that you're just not right for each other. 
The true test, of course, is whether your relationship continues once lockdown ends, and when COVID restrictions begin to lift."

That's a rule now enshrined in law in England as new legislation is brought in prohibiting indoor ""gatherings"" of two or more people from different households amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
It's been dubbed a lockdown ""sex ban"" by the media, but the new legislation makes no explicit mention of the word sex. But, is sex really banned? We took a look at the new rules.
Indoor ""gatherings"" are banned under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 bill, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. The new rules define gatherings as ""when two or more people are present together in the same place in order to engage in any form of social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity with each other."" If you're single or if you live apart from your partner this new legislation will affect you. 
The UK has been under lockdown since March 23 so 10 weeks and until now the government restrictions have stipulated that people are only allowed to leave their homes for a limited set of circumstances, including for work, health reasons, to buy food, or to get exercise. Those restrictions have been loosened over the past few weeks. 
SEE ALSO: Now is the time to ditch single people's most hated question
So, does sexual intercourse fall under the categories ""social interaction"" or ""any other activity""? It would appear so. Unless you live with your sexual partner, you will be breaking the law if you go to another person's house for sex. It's also prohibited by law to stay overnight away from home, unless it's for work, funerals, or avoiding harm. In short, it's illegal to visit friends, family, or sexual partners inside their homes or to spend any time indoors with someone you don't live with. 
For the people abiding by lockdown restrictions for the past 10 weeks, it likely comes as no surprise that sex with people outside your household remains off limits. So, what difference does this legislation actually make? Until now, the person who entered another person's home would have been in breach of the lockdown rules. Under this new law, both people can now be prosecuted under the amendment. Previous restrictions made no mention of meeting up in private places, and instead the message to 'stay at home' was disseminated by the government. According to police guidance published by the College of Policing, the approach to restrictions has changed as of June 1. ""Rather than requiring a reasonable excuse to leave the place where a person is living, there are specific things that members of the public cannot do,"" reads the guidance. 
There are exceptions to the rules about gatherings and overnight stays. Both are permitted in the following circumstances: 
<ul><li>between members of the same household
</li><li>for people attending a funeral; for an elite athlete and their coach or parent
</li><li>for work purposes or providing charitable services
</li><li>to facilitate house moves
</li><li>to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person
</li><li>to provide emergency assistance
</li><li>for providing registered early years childcare
</li><li>to avoid injury, illness, or to escape a risk of harm
</li><li>to facilitate access between parents and children
</li><li>to fulfill legal obligations or participate in legal proceedings
</li><li>for the purposes of education 
</li></ul>I emailed the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and asked the following question: ""Is it now illegal for a person to go to another person's house to have sex?"" In my email I noted that the legislation did not make explicit mention of 'sex' but that people have interpreted the law as a sex ban.
In reply, a DHSC spokesperson said: ""Changes to Coronavirus Regulations mean people can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households. However, everybody should act responsibly and continue to strictly observe social distancing rules.""

 Adam Wagner (@AdamWagner1) May 31, 2020
""Individuals who participate in a prohibited gathering will be in breach of the regulations, and the police will use their common sense and discretion in all cases,"" the statement continued. The spokesperson added that DHSC had ""set out"" its plan ""to return to life to as near normal as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly and fairly as possible in order to safeguard livelihoods, but in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS."" 
For people looking for loopholes to this law, remember that sex outdoors is already punishable under pre-existing including indecent exposure and outraging public decency. Furthermore, under new guidelines, people meeting up in outdoor gatherings of up to six people are required to practice social distancing.

Not sure if any of us quite expected that course of events to be on the cards, but glad to hear No. 10 has ruled it out, nonetheless. 
Police can arrest or fine those breaking the law, but they don't have the power to check inside your home. The default fine stands at £100 in England.
""The police will do as they have done since the beginning of the health regulations being in place. They will be exercising their common sense and engaging with the public and only issuing fixed penalty notices when they believe its a last resort,"" the prime minister's spokesperson told the Mirror. The spokesperson added that police in England don't have powers to enter people's homes under the regulations. ""What they can do is enter homes where they suspect serious criminal activity is taking place under separate and existing laws,"" they added. 
Looks like that sex hiatus will be going on a little longer then."

McDonald’s failed to provide adequate hand sanitizer, gloves and masks and has not notified its staff when an employee has become infected with the new coronavirus, according to a copy of the lawsuit provided by a spokesman for the workers. 
McDonald’s said in a statement that the allegations were inaccurate and that safety, including wellness checks and protective gear, was a top priority. 
The workers requested the Illinois state court issue an injunction, which would make McDonald’s stop requiring workers to reuse masks, mandate face coverings for customers and require the company to inform employees if a coworker becomes infected. 
Separately, McDonald’s workers at three California locations on Tuesday filed administrative actions over allegedly unsafe conditions with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. 
Employees at restaurants, warehouses and other essential businesses that remained open during the COVID-19 outbreak have protested and walked off the job over fears of getting sick. 
Trade groups have warned of a wave of litigation over the pandemic, but few cases have been filed. 
Retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and meat producers JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) were each sued over employee deaths from COVID-19. 
Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] was sued by a workers group demanding safety measures in a lawsuit that, like the McDonald’s case, alleged the company was a public nuisance. 
The Smithfield case was quickly dismissed because the judge said workplace conditions were a matter for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Department of Labor.

By the time they got back to the city, the restaurant where they had both worked had long since closed, and neither has been able to find a new job. 
They have used up their savings of 30,000 yuan ($4,202) and Zhang is now in debt, using one credit card to pay off another. 
“One month was fine. But after the second month, into the third, there was no money left,” the burly 28-year-old told Reuters. 
He has two young daughters being looked after by their grandparents back in the village, in an economically depressed old coal mining area. 
There are no jobs there, and having spent the last of their savings while looking for work in the capital, going back penniless would be a bitter pill to swallow. 
“How could I face my parents?” Zhang asked. 
In China, there are an estimated 280 million rural migrant workers, like Zhang. They have been, perhaps, the hardest-hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus, and many are excluded from unemployment insurance. 
In the first quarter, China’s economy contracted for the first time in decades. Due to uncertainties cast by the global pandemic, China’s communist leaders decided against setting a growth target this year. [nL4N2D40KJ] 
Surveyed unemployment in the nation of 1.4 billion was 6% in April, but many analysts say true unemployment must be far higher. [nL4N2BV0WT] 
Zhang and his wife rent a cheap apartment a three-hour bus ride from Beijing proper, where he spends every day wandering through old haunts looking for a job. 
“Work is hard to find this year. Too hard,” said Zhang. “And if you find it the wages are too low.” 
He reckoned restaurant wages have slumped by a third, and if he were lucky enough to find a job he would likely be paid only around 4,000 yuan ($560) per month. 
PECKING ORDER 
New policies call for migrant workers to be given equal access to employment services, and expanded subsistence allowances for those who return home. But many like Zhang have received little help so far. 
Dealing with unemployment is a top priority for Beijing, but while the government emphasises support for migrant workers, some analysts say they get less attention because they are less likely to create political problems. 
Bigger concerns are unemployed college graduates and laid-off urban workers, said Dan Wang, of the Economist Intelligence Unit. The latter are more likely to have mortgages to pay, and so could affect the real estate market, she said. 
There has not been any obvious increase in worker protests yet, but judging by postings on social media “discontent is growing,” said Geoff Crothall, of China Labour Bulletin. 
Premier Li Keqiang, in an annual report released on Friday, promised more help for small and medium-sized firms, which generate most of China’s jobs. The government expects 9 million new urban jobs to be created this year - its lowest target since 2013. 
As life returns to normal, “the economy will also start to flourish, and rural migrant workers’ incomes will definitely continue to grow,” Zhao Chenxin, vice secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a news briefing on Sunday.

But he said most new jobs would go to graduates and armed forces veterans, while a portion would go to migrant workers. 
“The hard truth is that, from a policymaker perspective, unemployed rural migrants are much less of a concern or threat than unemployed urban people,” said Louis Kuijs, of Oxford Economics.

The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, plunged 13.6% last month. That was the biggest drop since the government started tracking the series in 1959, and eclipsed the previous all-time decrease of 6.9% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would plummet 12.6% in April. Spending last month was depressed by a drop in outlays on healthcare as dental offices closed and hospitals postponed elective surgeries and non-emergency visits to focus on patients suffering from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 
There were also decreases in spending at restaurants, which have shifted to delivery and pick-up service only, and hotels and motels. Spending on food and beverages fell in April. 
The report added to dismal data on the labor market, manufacturing and the housing market in underscoring the horrific impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy, with analysts warning it could take years for activity to fully recover from the devastating blow. 
The economy contracted at a 5.0% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest pace of decline in gross domestic product since the fourth quarter of 2008. Consumer spending tumbled at a 6.8% rate, the sharpest drop since the second quarter of 1980. Economists expect GDP could collapse at as much as a 40% rate in the second quarter, a pace not seen since the 1930s. 
But the economic slump could be close to bottoming as businesses reopen after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Inflation was weak in April, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components falling 0.4%. That was the weakest reading since September 2001 and followed an unchanged reading in March. 
In the 12 months through April, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.0%. That was the smallest gain since December 2010 and followed a 1.7% increase in March. 
The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure. The U.S. central bank has a 2% inflation target. 
The COVID-19 crisis boosted incomes for consumers in April as the government’s historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion doled out $1,200 checks to millions of people and boosted unemployment benefits to cushion against the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic. 
Personal income surged a record 10.5% last month after falling 2.2% in March. Wages dropped 8.0% last month.

Last week Britain announced a 14-day quarantine from June 8 for arrivals from abroad, including citizens, as other nations, such as Italy and Spain, declared plans to ease theirs. 
O’Leary, who has described the plan as “unenforceable”, said many customers in Britain appeared to be ignoring the rules, with booking rates in recent days showing the airline’s 1,000 daily flights were likely to be more than half-full in July. 
“The UK and Ireland will either quietly drop them or drop them as another easing measure in the next week or two. I am confident of that,” O’Leary said. 
“There will be movement, because people are just going to ignore it. We have seen a big surge in bookings on our flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy over the weekend, and that seems to be continuing this week.” 
O’Leary said the booking patterns made him “reasonably confident” that the low-cost giant’s planes would be 50% to 60% full when it resumes flying 40% of its fleet in July, or about 1,000 flights a day. 
Booking are strong for all the main holiday destinations, including Croatia, France, Greece, Portugal and Spain, he added. Ryanair hopes a busy holiday season will boost confidence in Europe in flying for normal business activity.

Other data on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home surged to a near 11-1/2-year high last week. The reports followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a record surge in retail sales in May. Employers hired a historic 2.5 million workers last month. Activity, however, remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels and economists warn it could take even a decade for the economy to fully recover from the global pandemic. 
“Housing is a leading economic indicator and it is pointing the way forward but there is a limit to growth when the economy has to drag along the millions and millions of unemployed workers displaced in this pandemic recession who won’t be seeing paychecks anytime soon,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts rose 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 974,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. Starts declined 26.4% in April and 19.0% in March. They dropped 23.2% on a year-on-year basis in May. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, edged up 0.1% to a rate of 675,000 units in May. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 15.0% to a pace of 299,000 units. 
Homebuilding fell in the Midwest and the populous South. It rose in the West and Northeast. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, extending a three-day rally. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
Permits for future home construction rebounded 14.4% to a rate of 1.220 million units in May, reinforcing economists’ expectations that the housing market will lead the economy from the recession that started in February, driven by historically low mortgage rates. 
Though the housing market accounts for about 3.3% of gross domestic product, it has a larger footprint on the economy. A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 4% last week to their highest level since January 2009. 
Mortgage applications have climbed back above pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Signs of recovery in the housing market were underscored by a survey of Tuesday showing single-family homebuilders very upbeat in June about conditions in the industry. Builders reported increased demand for single-family homes in lower density neighborhoods.  
But with nearly 20 million unemployed and a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in some parts of the country, the housing market is not out of the woods yet. 
Single-family building permits increased 11.9% to a rate of 745,000 units in May. Permits for multi-family units surged 18.8% to a rate of 475,000 units.

The death toll among nurses more than doubled in the past month from 260 on May 6, according to its figures, which are based on data from more than 30 countries. 
“In the last two months, we have seen the number of deaths of nurses as a result of coronavirus around the world rise from 100 to now in excess of 600 and we think worldwide the number of healthcare workers who could be infected by the virus is around 450,000,” Howard Catton, chief executive officer of the Geneva-based ICN, told Reuters Television. 
“These are numbers that keep going up,” he said. 
The pandemic’s true cost among health professionals was not known, the association said, renewing its appeal for greater protection for them and systematic collection of reliable data. 
On average, 7 percent of all cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the novel coronavirus, are among healthcare workers, which means that nurses and other staff are at great personal risk “and so are the patients they care for”, it said. 
Extrapolating from more than 6 million reported cases gave its estimate of some 450,000 infections among healthcare workers. 
Infection rates among healthcare workers vary greatly between countries, with fewer than 1% in Singapore and more than 30% in Ireland, it said. Spain and Germany have recorded low numbers of fatalities among healthcare workers despite large outbreaks, it added. 
“Why do the rates of deaths among nurses appear higher in some Latin American countries?” it asked, referring to the region that the World Health Organization (WHO) says has emerged as the new epicentre for the pandemic. 
“Why are some countries reporting disproportionate deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic HCWs (healthcare workers)? This is an issue raised directly by the Philippine Nurses Association to ICN, concerning Filipino HCWs in the UK,” it said. 
The ICN represents 130 national associations and more than 20 million registered nurses.

Lonza, which hopes to make smaller batches of active ingredients for the U.S. biotechnology company’s experimental vaccine by July, now aims to finish a commercial production line in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a month or so earlier than its original December 2020 target, Albert Baehny told Reuters. 
A second commercial line, at Lonza’s site in Visp, Switzerland, had been slated for completion in January or February 2021 but now could be ready in December, he added. 
Moderna, which enlisted Lonza in May in a 10-year manufacturing contract, is racing with 100-plus other vaccine projects, having last week dosed initial participants in a 600-patient study. 
With accelerated deadlines, Lonza hopes to be ready to make vaccine ingredients quickly, should Moderna’s candidate pass muster with regulators. 
“Four to six weeks would be remarkable, if we can gain this time,” Baehny, also Lonza’s interim CEO, said during a video interview. “We know the technology, we feel comfortable with the manufacturing steps. If we can accelerate, let’s do it. This is pandemic speed.” 
He acknowledged potential bottlenecks, including hiring 60-70 employees to run each production line, availability of contractors and possible shortages of equipment like fermentation gear, could slow things down. 
Lonza is financing the first $60-$70 million commercial production line in Visp, he said. 
Moderna, flush with $483 million from the U.S. government and $1 billion-plus in fresh capital, is paying for the first U.S. production line, and up to three more at Lonza facilities in Portsmouth and Visp, Baehny said. 
Combined capacity could produce ingredients for 600 million to 1 billion vaccine doses annually, he said, depending on the size of the dose needed.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 46.8 last month from 37 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in private sector output. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
The improvement this month came as businesses reopened after shuttering in mid-March to control the spread of the respiratory illness. Still, layoffs continued this month and businesses put a freeze on hiring to deal with weak demand and to cut costs. 
The IHS Markit survey’s flash Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector rose to 46.7 in June from 37.5 in the prior month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 46.0 in June for the services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. 
In the manufacturing sector, the contraction in activity slowed this month, with the flash manufacturing PMI increasing to 49.6 from a reading of 39.8 in May. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, rising to 47.8 in June. 
A measure of new orders received by factories increased to a reading of 49.5 in June from 34.6 in May. 
Businesses reported increases in both input and output prices for the first time since February. According to IHS Markit, “firms stated that higher input costs from suppliers due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues were partially passed on to clients, with some mentioning that demand conditions were such that discounting was no longer required.”

WHAT DO SCIENTISTS SAY? 
Infectious disease experts say the closer people are to someone infected with COVID-19, and the more time people spend in close quarters, the higher the risk that the coronavirus will spread from one person to another. 
Beyond that simple reality, “it is just a matter of reducing risk with increased physical distance”, said Jonathan Reid, a professor of Physical Chemistry at Britain’s Bristol University. 
“The further you stand away from someone, the fewer droplets you will be exposed to. One meter only prevents you from being exposed to the largest of droplets; two meters reduces your exposure - but doesn’t make it zero risk.” 
A study in The Lancet this month found that physical distancing of at least 1m lowers risk of COVID-19 transmission, but that 2m could be more effective. 
WHAT IS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION’S ADVICE? 
The WHO says keeping a distance of at least one meter helps reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading in the small liquid droplets that people spray out when they cough, sneeze and talk. 
These droplets may contain the virus, and “if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets”, the WHO says. 
IS DISTANCE THE ONLY FACTOR? 
Switzerland’s health ministry says that “according to current data, a distance of more than one meter reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by more than 80% in both healthcare (settings) and everyday life”. 
It added, however, that the risk is higher “in circumstances in which a particularly large number of droplets are expelled, such as when singing or speaking loudly”. 
Shaun Fitzgerald, a professor of engineering at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said the key point is that “it’s not all about the distance”. 
“There are other mitigation measures,” he said - including the duration of close proximity, the number of people in a given space, the use of face masks, availability of ventilation, and whether people talk quietly or shout loudly. 
WHAT DO OTHER COUNTRIES RECOMMEND? 
China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong and Singapore recommend social distancing of 1 meter, and many people also choose to, or are required to, wear face masks in public spaces. 
Australia, Belgium, Greece, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal advise people to keep 1.5m apart. Switzerland this week also reduced the required distance to 1.5m from 2m. 
The guidance in the United States is six feet, or 1.8m.

Fakhar Zaman, Imran Khan, Kashif Bhatti, Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Rizwan and Wahab Riaz tested positive along with team masseur Malang Ali. 
The PCB on Monday confirmed Haider Ali, Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan had tested positive for the virus. 
“Like Haider, Haris and Shadab, none of the seven players and masseur had reported any prior symptoms of COVID-19 until they underwent first round of testing on Monday ahead of the side’s departure for Manchester,” the PCB said in a statement. 
“The PCB medical panel is already in contact with these players and the masseur, who have been instructed to observe strict quarantine at their homes for their and their families’ wellbeing.” 
Pakistan’s test and limited-overs squads are set to tour England for three tests and three Twenty20 internationals. They were due to fly out later this month before going into quarantine ahead of the first test starting on July 30. 
England director of cricket Ashley Giles said the tour was expected to go ahead. 
“At the moment I don’t think the series is in doubt. We’re far enough away from the start of the test series to not worry about that too much at the moment,” Giles told reporters on Tuesday. 
“There are some more test results coming out later from the rest of the group, so we’ll see what that says. But we’re still hopeful that the Pakistan team will be arriving in the country fairly soon.” 
The rate of new coronavirus cases has been rising fast in the country of 207 million people but Prime Minister Imran Khan a former Pakistan cricket captain has ruled out a nationwide lockdown. 
“The situation in Pakistan is not great at the moment and our thoughts go out to the whole country. Clearly it’s important that we get those guys in this country and we get on with that series,” Giles added. 
England are returning from the coronavirus shutdown with three tests against West Indies next month with the first scheduled to begin in Southampton on July 8 without spectators. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin in London and Rohith Nair in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond)"

Cipla, in an e-mailed statement, did not provide details on when the treatment, called Cipremi, will be available. 
Remdesivir has yet to be priced in the United States. 
Gilead said on Monday it is targeting remdesivir supply for more than 2 million COVID-19 patients by the end of the year.

“There is a risk that markets for the region dry out somewhat, [due to] large recessions, high unemployment, deteriorated fiscal accounts and low terms of trade,” Mauricio Cardenas told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. 
“My sense is China will not grow more than 5% in the next few years and the model will favor renewables,” said Cardenas, adding that a stronger Chinese recovery could aid Latin America by buoying demand for commodity exports. 
Shutdowns to battle the coronavirus have hit global oil prices LCOc1 this year, broadly knocking the shares of producers and compounding the economic fallout for Latin American countries, especially those heavily dependent on oil revenue. 
Cardenas expects Colombia’s oil production to fall from around 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) to around 800,000 bpd this year, adding that majority state-owned oil firm Ecopetrol (ECO.CN) ECO.N is unlikely to receive much government support. 
“The government will try to take as much cash from Ecopetrol as possible in 2021,” he said. 
Colombia has projected oil production for this year between 820,000 and 850,000 bpd.

Cardenas said Brazil’s Petrobras (PETR4.SA) (PETR3.SA) is unlikely to add more than 1 million bpd to its production between now and 2025, while Mexico’s Pemex is unlikely to boost production or meet its stated oil production goals due to lower capital spending.

Cardenas, finance minister from 2012 to 2018, said Colombia’s budget deficit was likely to reach around 7% of gross domestic product. The government has suspended fiscal deficit limits until 2022.

“We know COVID-19 has not gone away. We implore you to take responsible actions practice appropriate social distancing, wear a mask or face covering anytime you leave your home,” the Texas Children’s Hospital said in a statement, without specifying how many coronavirus patients they admitted. 
Texas reported over 5,000 new infections on Monday, a single-day record for the state. It has also seen COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record highs for 11 days in a row. 
Arizona and Nevada reported record increases in new cases on Tuesday after recording all-time highs last week, according to a Reuters tally. 
The United States recorded a 25% increase in new cases of COVID-19 in the week ended June 21, compared to the previous seven days, as Arizona and Florida joined Texas with record surges in new infections, a Reuters analysis found. [nL1N2DZ1AL] 
Ten states, including Texas, reported weekly new infection increases of more than 50%, according to the analysis of data from The COVID Tracking Project https://covidtracking.com, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
While most states are increasing testing, the number of tests coming back positive is rising. At least four states are averaging double-digit rates in the percentage of tests that are positive for the virus: Arizona at 20%, Florida and Utah both at 11%, and Texas at 10%. By contrast, New York, formerly the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has been reporting positive test rates of around 1%. 
The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday held fast to his claim that the spike in U.S. cases in multiple states was due to testing, not increased spread of the disease. 
“Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!” he tweeted. 
Many of these states are also seeing record hospitalizations - a metric not affected by increased testing. 
The president will speak with students in Phoenix on Tuesday after holding his first campaign rally in months in Oklahoma over the weekend. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to challenge Trump in the Nov. 3 election, called the president’s plans to speak to thousands of supporters in Phoenix “reckless and irresponsible” at a time when the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Arizona is continuing to rise.

Djokovic was criticised for hosting the tournament amid a pandemic after Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also returned positive tests after playing in the tournament that was held in Serbia and Croatia. 
Following is a list of quotes from the 17-times Grand Slam champion on tennis, the pandemic, vaccines and more: 
Djokovic on testing positive for COVID-19 (June 23): 
“The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as (wife) Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative. 
“I’m extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and that everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days.” 
Djokovic on mandatory coronavirus vaccinations (April 19): 
“Personally I’m opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel. 
“But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I’ll have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.” 
Djokovic on the power of positive emotions (May 6): 
“This is something that is not linked to any form of official way of presenting nutrition and how you should eat and drink. 
“I know some people that, through energetic transformation, through the power of prayer, through the power of gratitude, they managed to turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water. 
“Scientists have proven that in (an) experiment, that molecules in the water react to our emotions to what has been said.” 
Djokovic on the U.S. Open’s strict protocols (June 6): 
“The rules that they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme. We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week. 
“Also, we could bring one person to the club which is really impossible. I mean, you need your coach, then a fitness trainer, then a physiotherapist.” 
Djokovic on staging an exhibition tournament in Serbia amid the pandemic (June 12): 
“We have different circumstances and measures (to other countries) so it’s very difficult to think of international standards (regarding the pandemic). 
“We’ve had better numbers compared to some other countries. Of course, lives have been lost and that’s horrible to see, in the region and worldwide. But life goes on and we as athletes are looking forward to competing. 
“You can also criticise us and say this is maybe dangerous but it’s not up to me to make the calls what is right or wrong health-wise. We are doing what the Serbian government is telling us and hopefully we soon will get back on tour collectively.” 
Djokovic on the prospect of the U.S. Open going ahead and the ATP Tour’s resumption (June 18): 
“Hopefully every single player who is participating, chosen by ranking and who deserves their place at the U.S. Open, will have an equal opportunity to travel there and compete as everybody else. 
“I’m extremely happy and excited to see that all the tournaments, especially Grand Slams, are organising their events. 
“I think that a lot of people were sceptical, especially for the U.S. events considering what the U.S. went through as a country during this pandemic. So a lot of people, including myself, were quite sceptical on whether it would happen or not.”

Nick Kyrgios, two-times Grand Slam quarter-finalist: 
""Prayers up to all the players that have contracted COVID-19. Dont @ me for anything Ive done that has been 'irresponsible' or classified as 'stupidity' - this takes the cake,"" the Australian wrote on Twitter here

Patrick McEnroe, former doubles champion and commentator: 
""When I sent out a tweet a couple weeks ago about that event in Serbia I said yeah it looks like a normal tennis event to me. I'm not sure everyone got my point,"" he said in a video on Twitter here
“Maybe they are starting to get it now. Nothing’s foolproof so don’t be foolish. That’s my message.” 
Over the past two days, organisers have also been criticised for allowing stands to be packed with fans during the opening leg in Belgrade. With no social distancing rules in place in Serbia, players hugged at the net, played basketball, posed for pictures, attended press conferences and were out dancing together. 
British number one Dan Evans: 
“I don’t think he should be having a players’ party and dancing all over each other,” Evans said. 
“Players have tested positive. He should feel some responsibility in his event and how it’s transpired, really. 
“It’s very unfortunate that Grigor has it and Coric has it but you strip it back, is it a surprise? I think that’s the question we should all ask.” 
Australian Open quarter-finalist Tennys Sandgren: 
""If Novak doesnt get COVID Im going to start blessing my water with positive vibes,"" the American said here
American tennis player Sachia Vickery: 
""Last one for the Djokovic fan club who abused me last week after all I said was the first priority should be health and not how many people the top players can bring to a slam,"" she wrote on Twitter here ""Its awfully quiet right now."" 
American tennis player Mitchell Krueger: 
""Its only inevitable that all these boneheaded decisions are possibly putting U.S. Open at risk. Which means this also affects some 300+ players. Nobody is bigger than the sport,"" he tweeted here
“One step forward five steps back,” Krueger added in response to Djokovic’s positive test. 
Noah Rubin, former junior Wimbledon champion: 
""Its just not okay. Reckless and disappointing that they thought tennis deserved the risk,"" he said on Twitter here
British tennis player Tara Moore: 
""Wait Djokovic is the guy who was enraged at U.S. Open for only allowing 1 entourage in, but ok with Qs (qualifiers), wheelchair, juniors to be cancelled but lobbied hard for more of his team to be able to go.

HOUSTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies slammed the brakes on returning staff to their Houston offices as COVID-19 cases soared and top hospitals warned they could soon run out of beds for the most severely ill patients. 
A record number of new illnesses in Texas this week spurred local officials to impose restrictions as new cases topped 5,000 on two days in a row. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds were 97% full at Houston’s Texas Medical Center, which said it may soon move to surge ICU capacity assignments, officials said. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has led a phased reopening of shops, bars and amusement parks from May 1, and businesses have rolled out their own office restarts. But on Wednesday, he warned of a “massive outbreak” and urged people to stay at home. 
Many energy firms qualify as essential, and therefore are free to staff normally, but the surge in illness and hospitalizations has large employers delaying or halting openings. 
Halliburton Co, the second-largest U.S. oilfield service company by revenue, delayed for two weeks a second-phase of its return-to-work plan, a spokeswoman said. 
Chevron also has delayed its reopening plans for further evaluation, said spokesman Sean Comey. About 5% of its Houston office staff and about 2% of its San Ramon, California, workforce are in their offices now, he said. 
Midcoast Energy, a natural gas pipeline company, reopened on June 1 then sent Houston employees home three weeks later after two tested positive for the virus, according to a person familiar with the matter. President Robert Bond did not reply to requests for comment. 
Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips returned some white-collar workers to their campuses in May or this month. Exxon will remain below 50% capacity at its Houston-area facility, a spokesman said. Conoco is prepared to change its return-to-office plan if needed, a spokesman said. 
Phillips 66 said the vast majority of its staff had returned and would remain working from their offices. “We are a critical infrastructure industry and have an ongoing obligation to continue operating,” spokesman Joe Gannon said, noting that the company follows Centers for Disease Control and government advisories.

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee will publish preliminary findings from its assessment of risks from non-banks in early August, Bailey told Britain’s finance minister Rishi Sunak in a letter made available to the media. 
Non-banks can include investment funds and money market funds. 
“Where appropriate, the assessment will identify gaps in resilience in the non-bank financial sector and the potential measures that may be taken to increase resilience,” the letter said. 
Money market funds came under severe stress during bouts of heavy market volatility in March and were helped by broader central bank interventions to boost liquidity in markets. Many UK retail property funds were suspended as they were unable to value their assets. 
The assessment will set out a list of possible indicators that the FPC could publish regularly to monitor risks from non-banks, Bailey said. 
The BoE had already begun working on reducing risks in open-ended funds after the suspension of retail property funds in the aftermath of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, and later on the shuttering of a flagship fund run by then star stockpicker Neil Woodford. 
Bailey said the FPC will have “regards to opportunities” in financial services from Britain’s departure from the EU in relation to competition, innovation and competitiveness where it does not threaten financial stability. 
Backers of Brexit have said that leaving the EU is an opportunity be more flexible with regulation to help London remain a globally competitive financial centre. 
The BoE said it was committed to robust financial rules irrespective of Britain’s future EU relationship.

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in March the government has pumped in 7.6 billion Croatian kuna ($1.13 billion) to support salaries in companies in trouble. 
The new support measure will enable hard-hit firms employing more then 10 workers to shorten the working week with financial assistance from the government, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told the cabinet. 
“This is the first stronger measure after those adopted over the past three months to preserve jobs and strengthen liquidity,” he said, adding that the measure would stay in force until the end of the year. 
The government has estimated the measure will cost state coffers around 3 billion kuna. 
It had earlier said it would need about 70 billion kuna over the next few months to finance the measures it undertakes to combat the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. 
Croatia, which has run budget surpluses in the last three years, now expects a budget deficit of 6.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, and a reduction below 3% of GDP in 2021. 
The economy is forecast to shrink by 9.4% this year because of the coronavirus impact. At the end of last year, authorities had projected growth of 2.5% in 2020, after expanding by 2.9% in 2019. 
So far, Croatia has registered 2,388 coronavirus infections and 170 deaths from the respiratory disease.

Tourists to Hawaii will be exempted from the quarantine rule upon arrival from different states if they carry a valid coronavirus test result prior to the visit, Governor David Ige said late on Wednesday. 
“Beginning August 1, we will be implementing pre-travel testing program for travellers to Hawaii as an alternative for 14-day mandatory quarantine,” Ige said in a briefing. 
The current 14-day mandatory quarantine for everyone traveling into the state began in March, with the governor later extending it until the end of June. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the DOJ gave its support to a lawsuit challenging the state’s coronavirus measures, saying visitors are being denied rights granted to most island residents. The lawsuit was filed by Nevada and California residents who own property in Hawaii. 
Tourism is a big part of Hawaii’s economy - more than 10.4 million visitors came to the islands last year, supporting some 216,000 jobs in a population of around 1.4 million, according to the state tourism authority. 
The state at one point considered sweeping use of GPS-enabled ankle bracelets or smartphone tracking apps to enforce stay-at-home orders given to arriving air passengers. 
However, that plan was put on the back burner after the Hawaii attorney general’s office raised concerns. 
The United States has recorded about 2.4 million cases of coronavirus infections as of early Thursday, with nearly 122,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
Hawaii has had over 830 cases of infection and 17 deaths from the outbreak. The state’s average of one death per 100,000 people is among the lowest in the United States.

Golfweek, which spoke to Koepka, said the four-times major champion, his caddie and coach all went for additional testing after playing a practice round with Graeme McDowell, who also withdrew after his caddie returned a positive test. 
“I’m going to pull out to protect everybody else. I think it’s the right thing to do,” American Koepka said. “I don’t want to risk anyone’s life if they have respiratory issues or underlying conditions. The only way this Tour can continue is if guys do this sort of thing and be proactive about it.” 
The PGA Tour would not confirm Koepka’s withdrawal from the Travelers Championship but said it will issue a statement later on Wednesday. 
Golfweek said Northern Irishman McDowell’s caddie is isolating in Florida and had not travelled to Connecticut for the tournament. 
The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is the third of five events on the PGA Tour’s revamped schedule which is closed to the public in a bid to help stem the spread of the virus. 
American Nick Watney last week tested positive for the virus, forcing him to withdraw ahead of second-round action in South Carolina. 
Cameron Champ, a two-times winner on the PGA Tour, pulled out of the Travelers Championship on Tuesday after testing positive for COVID-19.

Both Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s give Canada a triple-A rating. 
Canada would run a much expanded general government deficit of 16.1% of GDP in 2020 and emerge from recession with much higher public debt ratios, Fitch said. 
The ratings agency expects the coronavirus response to raise Canada’s consolidated gross general government debt to 115.1% of GDP in 2020, up from 88.3% of GDP in 2019. 
Ottawa is rolling out more than C$150 billion in direct aid to support the economy. 
“A worse case scenario for Canadians and the economy would have been to not act,” said Finance Minister Bill Morneau in a statement to Reuters. 
Financial market reaction was muted, with the Canadian dollar slightly extending its decline to 1.3617 to the U.S. dollar, or 73.44 U.S. cents, while Canada’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.545%. 
“Canada is still a very strong credit in a relative sense,” said Derek Holt, vice President of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. “Ratings are just not a major market driver in relation to all other influences upon bond markets and such actions often lag developments that markets have already digested.”

The 26-year-old American has been crushing balls after adding muscle during the PGA Tour’s three-month break and has been knocking on the door of a win since the restart with top 10 finishes at Colonial and at Harbour Town last week. 
“I think this golf course suits me a little bit better,” he told reporters ahead of the opening round of the Travelers Championship. 
“I can use the length to my advantage on the front nine and there’s a couple of holes on the back nine I can do the same,” he said. 
“I definitely feel like I can let it go a lot more.” 
DeChambeau will benefit from a field that saw major champions Brooks Koepka and Graeme McDowell withdraw on Wednesday after their caddies both tested positive for COVID-19. 
Hard-hitting Cameron Champ withdrew earlier in the week after he became the second PGA Tour golfer to test positive for the virus, and last week’s winner Webb Simpson said he would sit the tournament out after a family member tested positive. 
In response the PGA Tour on Wednesday said stricter safety measures would be put in place. 
The thinning of the still-impressive field could clear the way for DeChambeau, who added 25 pounds during the break and has his sights set on winning his first major title this year. 
“I knew that if I could start working out my body every single day, I’d be better the next day, and other people would be behind,” he said. 
“I thought that if I could do that every single day through quarantine, I’d come back a different person, and I did, and I hope that it’s given me an edge.”

In another reminder of fuel demand woes, Australia’s flagship airline, Qantas Airways, said on Thursday it expected little revival in international travel until at least July 2021, as it slashed a fifth of its workforce and grounded 100 planes.

Worries about a second wave of COVID-19 cases in several U.S. states, where lockdowns had eased, and a rapid spread of infections in South America and South Asia are expected to keep a lid on fuel demand, market watchers said. 
“The latest trends there are not encouraging,” said National Australia Bank’s head of commodity research, Lachlan Shaw. 
The fear is that even if lockdowns are eased, people will stay home because of the perceived health risks. 
Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiCorp, said mobility data from Google showed driving in Texas, Florida and to a certain extent California was flatlining. 
In another reminder of fuel demand woes, Australia’s flagship airline, Qantas Airways, said on Thursday it expected little revival in international travel until at least July 2021, as it slashed a fifth of its workforce and grounded 100 planes. 
“It highlights the reality that we’re talking years before international aviation recovers probably three to four years,” Shaw said. (Reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Koustav Samanta in Singapore; editing by Richard Pullin)"

Hinako Shibuno, the 2019 British Open winner, and world number four Nasa Hataoka were among the players who teed off following an hour-long rain delay. 
The pandemic had forced the cancellation of 16 tournaments on the Japanese women’s tour this season before it began on Thursday. Four tournaments in July and one each in August and October have also been scrapped.

Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) announced plans to roll out the phone app in late March, just as the country went into lockdown, and initially expected it to be launched within 10 days. 
HSE Chief Executive Paul Reid told a news conference on Wednesday that it has been approved by Ireland’s data protection agency and was awaiting final sign-off by the government. 
So far, 1,720 people have died from COVID-19 in Ireland, which has had a manual contact tracing programme in place since its outbreak began at the end of February. 
The number of confirmed cases has fallen to an average of 11 a day over the past week as the economy prepares to almost fully reopen next week, with just 37 patients in hospital compared to a peak of nearly 900 that threatened to overwhelm the health service in mid-April. 
Ireland will adopt a decentralised model for its tracing app where the data will be held on the person’s mobile phone and not centrally by the health service, which authorities hope will alleviate privacy concerns. 
“We’ve done our own research in the early stages of the trial, there is pretty much a positive pick-up, that people feel they will use it and would use it in the future. We’d be strongly encouraged by that,” Reid said. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

Golfweek, which spoke to Koepka, said the four-times major champion, his caddie and coach all went for additional testing after playing a practice round with Graeme McDowell, who also withdrew after his caddie returned a positive test. 
“I’m going to pull out to protect everybody else. I think it’s the right thing to do,” American Koepka said. “I don’t want to risk anyone’s life if they have respiratory issues or underlying conditions. The only way this Tour can continue is if guys do this sort of thing and be proactive about it.” 
The PGA Tour would not confirm Koepka’s withdrawal from the Travelers Championship but said it will issue a statement later on Wednesday. 
Golfweek said Northern Irishman McDowell’s caddie is isolating in Florida and had not travelled to Connecticut for the tournament. 
The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is the third of five events on the PGA Tour’s revamped schedule which is closed to the public in a bid to help stem the spread of the virus. 
American Nick Watney last week tested positive for the virus, forcing him to withdraw ahead of second-round action in South Carolina. 
Cameron Champ, a two-times winner on the PGA Tour, pulled out of the Travelers Championship on Tuesday after testing positive for COVID-19.

Borrowers are adjusting earnings as if the crisis had never happened, known as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and coronavirus (Ebitdac), or “earnings before coronavirus.” 
“Companies may be keeping earnings artificially high in order to avoid a financial covenant breach. It could delay a restructuring that perhaps should be happening earlier,” said Jane Gray, head of European research at Covenant Review. 
Ebitda is a key measure of performance and business valuation. Loosening documentation over the past few years has gifted borrowers a great level of flexibility to adjust their earnings via numerous exclusions and add-backs. It has become common practice to estimate generous cost savings and synergies on buyouts to lower leverage and make deals acceptable to regulators and investors. 
However, a growing number of lawyers and investors argue that adding back coronavirus-related costs is controversial and not appropriate due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. 
“The language in documentation allows such flexibility and borrowers are interpreting it in a way that is favourable for them. But is it a correct interpretation? It is controversial,” a leveraged loan lawyer said. 
FAIRY TALE 
German beauty retailer Douglas, which has 2,400 stores across Europe, is one such company to make coronavirus adjustments. 
Last month, the leveraged loan borrower added 15m back to earnings for its second quarter results ended 31 March, to take account of what it termed, “staff and rent related idle costs in connection with our closed stores.” 
Douglas’ reported Ebitda was a 1m loss in the second quarter, compared with adjusted Ebitdac of a 23m profit. 
The 15m add-back also pushed leverage down by around 0.3 times, according to fintech data provider 9fin. 
Changing the numbers to take account of coronavirus is seen as controversial as no one knows how long the pandemic it will last and how it will play out. 
“When it comes to coronavirus, it’s a different scenario. Companies are estimating based on a hypothetical situation, and no one knows how it will turn out,” said Sabrina Fox, executive adviser at European Leveraged Finance Association (ELFA). 
“Ebitdac is just a fairy tale and using it in covenant calculations would be like living in a world of imagination.” 
In addition, the ELFA whose members include Allianz Global Investors and Janus Henderson Investors urged loan borrowers and high-yield issuers not to use Ebitdac as a calculation metric to incur additional debt. 
“We discourage companies from stripping off the effects of the pandemic only to wind up with more leverage,” said Fox. 
“It is by no means guaranteed that Ebitdac reflects forward-looking operating trends, and as such it should not be relied on as a calculation metric for any purpose under debt documents.” 
GETTING CREATIVE 
Apart from earnings adjustments, some borrowers have taken another approach to covenant calculations by using 2019 historical figures, instead of 2020 figures in a bid to avoid breaches. 
US ticket and concert company Live Nation made amendments in April with existing lenders that allowed the firm to use 2019 earnings to calculate the consolidated net leverage ratio covenant for the fourth quarter of 2020 through to the second quarter of 2021, according to the firm’s result announcement. 
US luggage maker Samsonite also amended loan terms so that it could use 2019 Ebitda figures in covenant calculations from the end of September 2021 until end of March 2022. 
“It’s really the same thing,” said Gray at Covenant Review. “Using last year’s figures is simply a way of justifying the quantification of the adjustment they are making. They are seeking to ‘normalise’ Ebitda as if Covid had not happened.” 
The key reason for existing lenders or institutional investors to support those amendments is to limit the amount of defaulted loans in their portfolio, taking a view that the pandemic will be a short-term matter, bankers and investors said. 
“It’s a sticking plaster solution,” a loan banker said. 
However, no-one knows how long such flexibility could last and when lenders’ patience will dry up. 
“I don’t think anyone has a clue on any of it. It’s all being done under the illusion that the world will return to normal in a couple months. By now that should be an obvious lie.” said an investor in the US. “Somebody is wrong.”

Monahan, who was not originally listed on the interview schedule ahead of the Travelers, announced new safety measures and reiterated existing ones. 
“All of us have an extraordinary responsibility to follow those protocols. For any individual that does not, there will be serious repercussions, and I’m not going to get into the specifics of it,” Monahan said from TPC River Highlands, site of this week’s Travelers Championship. 
“But everybody knows and needs to know that our future, our ability to sustain this business and to impact the communities where we play and to create so many jobs is contingent on our ability to follow those protocols.” 
Monahan delivered his remarks a day after a second PGA Tour player in a five-day span tested positive for COVID-19. 
In the three weeks since the PGA Tour returned from its COVID-19 hiatus, Monahan said there have been seven positive results from 2,757 total in-market tournament tests across the main circuit and developmental Korn Ferry Tour. 
“It’s a low number, but every number hurts,” Monahan said. 
Monahan said major champions Brooks Koepka and Graeme McDowell have withdrawn from this week’s event “out of an abundance of caution” after their caddies tested positive. 
World number five Webb Simpson also withdrew after a family member tested positive while Koepka’s younger brother Chase decided to sit out because he played a practice round with Brooks and McDowell. 
Among changes announced by Monahan are further testing, player instructors being added to the testing bubble and an onsite fitness trailer to deter golfers from using outside gyms. 
Monahan said he has confidence in the protocols in place and remains hopeful the PGA Tour’s schedule will not be interrupted. 
“We feel like we’re on a path that’s going to allow us to continue to sustain our return to golf,” said Monahan.

Mickelson closed with a birdie at the last hole of the TPC River Highlands course for a seven-under-par 63 that brought him to 13 under on the week and one shot clear of first-round leader Mackenzie Hughes (68) and sponsor invite Will Gordon (62). 
World No. 1 Rory McIlroy (68) and Xander Schauffele (68) were among a pack of five golfers a further three shots back. 
Mickelson, in his first tournament since turning 50 last week, will have a short turnaround as third round action will feature threesomes off split tees starting at 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) due to expectations for inclement weather later in the day. 
“It’s probably a little bit difficult as you get older, but when you’re playing well, you have that extra momentum, and it should be okay,” said Mickelson. 
Gordon, in only his eighth PGA Tour start and playing on a sponsor exemption, made the most of his opportunity as he mixed six birdies and one bogey over his opening eight holes before adding another three birdies after the turn. 
“I knew that (the course) was going to be gettable this morning,” said Gordon. “Just tried to come into today with a really positive mindset and aggressive mindset and I was able to do that.”

United withdrew their annual financial targets in May after losing about 23 million pounds ($28 million) in quarterly revenue due to the season being temporarily suspended because of the coronavirus crisis. 
The Premier League restarted this month but fans have been barred from attending games, and Solskjaer said United, who also have 429 million pounds in debt, would adopt a cautious approach to spending. 
“We’ll have to take a big look at things ourselves to see how hard we’ve been hit,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final match at Norwich City. 
“It’s not for me to say we are going to have X amount because I don’t really know. We are a financially strong club, but we are also probably being hit more than anybody else.” 
United are fifth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, with seven games left to play. 
With second-placed Manchester City facing a European ban for breaching UEFA financial rules, fifth place should guarantee qualification for the lucrative Champions League, unless City win an appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 
City will discover the fate of their appeal next month, while United could also qualify for Europe’s elite club competition by winning the Europa League this season. 
“Let’s see how quickly we can get our fans back into the stadium,” Solskjaer added. 
“There’s still a lot of uncertainty and these three or four months, every businessman in the world, every footballer in the world, I think everyone is still unsure what the effect will be.”

The country had reported its first case on March 6 and what was thought to be its first death - that of a 58-year-old taxi driver in the Caribbean city of Cartagena - on March 21. 
But death figures published by the statistics agency show the first suspected death from COVID-19 occurred on Feb. 15, while the first confirmed death took place Feb. 26. 
The country registered 30 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 94 suspected ones in the first quarter, the DANE agency added. 
Some 40% of COVID-19 deaths in the quarter occurred in capital city Bogota, while provinces Valle del Cauca and Bolivar accounted for 23% and 10% respectively. 
Antioquia province, home to second city Medellin, accounted for 59% of suspected COVID-19 deaths, DANE said. 
Many early cases of the disease - including the case originally reported as the country’s first - were imported by Colombians or foreigners arriving from Europe or the United States. 
Colombia has now reported more than 77,100 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 2,491 deaths. 
Colombia’s economy has been battered by a slump in oil prices and measures implemented by President Ivan Duque to control the spread of the virus. The government expects the economy to contract by 5.5% this year. 
Duque declared an ongoing quarantine in late March. While certain restrictions have started lifting, the period of obligatory isolation was extended this week until July 15.

Airlines such as Australia’s Qantas (QAN.AX), Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines are looking to defer plane deliveries from Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) and this means postponed demand for cobalt and nickel alloys used in jet turbine blades. 
Graphic: Cobalt demand from aerospace, here
But this is only part of the story. 
“The harsh high temperature and pressure environments of the jet engine necessitates regular replacement of turbine blades,” said CRU analyst George Heppel. “But planes are grounded, turbine blades aren’t being used and don’t need replacing.” 
Heppel expects cobalt demand for aerospace rotating parts to total 4,442 tonnes this year, a drop of 18% from 2019 and the lowest since 2011. Overall, he forecasts a 6,300 tonne surplus this year and global consumption at 131,800 tonnes. 
Graphic: Cobalt market balance, here
Prices of cobalt metal, at around $30,000 a tonne, are down more than 15% since early February and are the lowest since last August. As surpluses become more visible lower levels are expected. 
Graphic: Cobalt prices, here
Roskill analyst Ying Lu said recent price convergence between higher grade cobalt metal used for alloys and standard grade was a signal of weak demand from the aerospace sector. She expects a relatively balanced market this year compared with a 10,000 tonne surplus last year. 
    “The pandemic has affected demand and supply. Cobalt mined from (Democratic Republic of) Congo is typically exported for refining through Durban in South Africa, where there was lockdown (to halt the spread of the new coronavirus), which created logistical disruptions.” 
Cobalt from the DRC comes in the form of hydroxide, which is turned into chemicals for the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles. Much of it goes to China, which dominates the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries. 
Falling sales of electric vehicles in China, including by Tesla (TSLA.O) and BYD (002594.SZ) (1211.HK) earlier this year and in the second half of last year, have also weakened cobalt consumption. 
However, demand from the electric vehicle sector, which represents 20% of global demand, is expected to recover at a faster pace than from aerospace due to government incentives to promote clean air initiatives.

The Cup of Nations is set for Cameroon from Jan 9-Feb 6 but appears increasingly under threat as time begins to run out. Qualifying is still far from complete and national team football on the continent is not due to resume before October in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
CAF’s executive committee will meet in an online conference on Tuesday to decide what to do, and also set out a possible process for completing this season’s two continental club competitions. 
FIFA’s decision on Thursday to cancel September’s window for national team matches in all regions, except Europe and South America, has left CAF with fewer dates to try and complete the competition’s qualifying campaign and the finalise the field for the 24-team tournament. 
There are still four rounds of qualifiers to play and although they could yet be scheduled for October and November, that would mean having to postpone the start of the group phase of 2022 World Cup qualifiers. 
There is also the squeeze that hosting the Cup of Nations next January would place on domestic competition, with the 2020-21 season in most of Africa’s major leagues set to start late as they seek to first complete current campaigns which have been suspended by the pandemic. Most African leagues are halted mid-season to make space for the Cup of Nations. 
“The Cup of Nations could be pushed back by 12 months,” a senior official told Reuters, asking not to be identified, although general secretary Abdelmounaim Bah told reporters last week the best option remained its current dates. 
CREATIVE PLAN 
The African Champions League and African Confederation Cup were suspended at the semi-final stage and CAF will have to come up with a creative plan to finish the competitions with borders mostly shut, flights suspended and football stopped across the continent because of the pandemic. 
CAF must also decide whether to cancel this year’s African Nations Championship, which was due to be played in Cameroon in April. It is the tournament hosted every two years for quasi national teams made up of home based players only. 
A decision must also be made on the African women’s championship, scheduled for November but with qualification also far from complete. 
But in this case, a postponement looks an easy decision to make because CAF have yet to find a venue for the tournament after Congo withdrew as hosts in July last year.

World market prices of gold - viewed by investors as a safe store of value in uncertain times - have surged to levels last seen in 2012, and are up 16% this year XAU=. 
Artisanal gold production has grown this decade: here
But millions of subsistence workers, who typically use rudimentary techniques at unregulated mines, have received none of the benefits as pandemic disruption to supply lines has shrunk their already sporadic earnings.

The World Bank is creating a dedicated emergency relief fund for the estimated 40 million artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) worldwide, three sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
A World Bank spokeswoman confirmed the fund, which was yet to be officially launched. She said the fund would “provide short-term assistance to artisanal mining communities to better cope with COVID-19 impacts”.  
Donors have contributed $5 million to the fund, and the Bank aims to expand it to $15 million. That money would be disbursed to projects helping miners across geographies and minerals. 
“This is very rare because usually disaster recovery funding is not specifically directed to ASM as a uniquely vulnerable livelihood group,” said one consultant, who declined to be named. 
The Canada-based Artisanal Gold Council (AGC), an NGO, is trying out a project to help communities dependent on small-scale gold mining in Burkina Faso. 
With 40% of the population living below the national poverty line, the country is particularly vulnerable. 
The AGC has bought gold direct from miners at the pre-pandemic going rate, and is exporting it to PAMP, a London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) certified refinery in Switzerland. 
PAMP declined a request for an interview, and did not reply to written questions from Reuters. 
The gold, sourced from five artisanal miners around the southern town of Dano, was transported to the capital, Ouagadougou, and was in the process of being certified for export by the mines ministry. 
The initial export, of 800 grammes of gold (worth around $48,847), is a trial. Depending on its success, the AGC plans to source a further 20kg from Burkina Faso, and then begin sourcing from Colombia too. 
Aboubakar Dabire, a miner who sold 500 grammes of gold to the AGC, said: “My community was really hard hit by COVID-19. When gold prices are low, everything is undermined.” 
“People will take this [scheme] seriously as it is a well-organised system,” Dabire added. “It means they will make an effort to avoid certain buyers in the field who are ruining the market.” 
Attempts to formalise artisanal mining, stamp out child labour, and sever links with illicit minerals trade face significant obstacles. 
In remote artisanal gold mining communities, trade is largely informal and the rigorous documentation required by LBMA guidelines is hard to enforce. 
These guidelines require gold refineries to verify where their gold is mined, show it does not fund conflict or armed groups, collect “Know Your Customer” information on the whole supply chain, and verify all legal taxes have been paid. 
It took the AGC two months to complete the process. 
The challenges help to explain why only a tiny share of the gold produced worldwide is ""London Good Delivery"" certified by the LBMA. In Africa, 1.6% of gold is. For an interactive graphic click here: tmsnrt.rs/2ABHD0j
The effort and cost required to implement these standards and bring artisanal gold into formal channels mean other NGOs do not consider direct market intervention, such as that being done by AGC, viable. 
“We are very aware that [gold] prices are depressed for local miners, but we are not convinced the international market is the route to go down,” David Finlay, responsible minerals manager at the Fairtrade Foundation, said.

The findings are the first detailed look at a range of neurological complications of COVID-19, the researchers said, and underline a need for larger studies to find the mechanisms behind them and assist the search for treatments. 
“This (is) an important snapshot of the brain-related complications of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients. It is critically important that we continue to collect this information to really understand this virus fully,” said Sarah Pett, a University College London professor who co-led the work. 
The study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal on Thursday, looked in detail at 125 cases from across the UK. Co-lead researcher Benedict Michael, from Liverpool University, said it was important to note that it focused on severe cases. 
Data was collected between April 2 and April 26 - when the disease was spreading exponentially in the UK. 
The most common brain complication seen was stroke, which was reported in 77 of 125 patients. Of these, most were in patients over 60, and most were caused by a blood clot in the brain, known as an ischaemic stroke. 
The study also found that 39 of the 125 patients showed signs of confusion or changes in behaviour reflecting an altered mental state. Of these, nine had unspecified brain dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, and seven had inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis. 
Michael said the findings were an important early step towards defining COVID-19’s effect on the brain. “We now need detailed studies to understand the possible biological mechanisms ... so we can explore potential treatments,” he said.

“I cannot rule out measures on jobs. I want to limit as much as possible job cuts,” ADP chairman and chief executive Augustin de Romanet told RTL radio. 
“We will have discussions from July (with staff representatives), so they are informed of the company’s future,” he said. 
Romanet, who has previously said ADP risked losing 2.5 billion euros in sales due to the crisis, said ADP could cut annual investments to 400-500 million euros from 1 billion. 
He was speaking as Orly airport near Paris was reopened on Friday after a near three-month closure. 
Travellers will be able to fly to 25 destinations and there will be 74 flights on Friday compared to 600 normally, he said. 
For July, Romanet predicted 200 flights daily from Orly. 
Asked about plans for the privatisation of ADP, he said: “To my knowledge, the economy minister thinks this is no longer on the agenda.” 
This month, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said the privatisation of ADP was “not a subject that will be on the table in the months ahead. After 2022, we will see.”

Health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara said while there was no target number for downloads, “we want to make as many people as possible to use this app”. 
Apps such as this may be able to halt an epidemic if usage reaches 60% of the population, according to an Oxford University study. 
Yuki Furuse, a professor at Kyoto University, said there’s debate about whether usage has to be that high to be effective, but “the more people use the app, the more it would be effective for the outbreak response.” 
Japan lifted a state of emergency in late May. It has weathered the epidemic better than most developed countries, with almost 18,000 infections and 969 deaths. 
The app, named COCOA for Contact-Confirming Application, was designed by Microsoft Corp and is available for Apple Inc’s iPhone and devices using Google’s Android software. 
It uses Bluetooth signals to detect contact with nearby users lasting 15 minutes or more. If a user later tests positive for the virus, their contacts can be traced and notified through the programme. 
Numerous countries have rolled out contact-tracing apps, including Australia, Malaysia, Britain, India, Germany and Italy. 
Singapore was among the first with its TraceTogether app launched in March, but privacy concerns hampered its uptake, prompting a switch to wearable devices.

Australia has been generally successful in containing the new coronavirus, even if the populous southern state of Victoria on Friday experienced a 10th straight day of double-digit new infections. 
The relaxation of restrictions began in some parts of Australia in early May and the government has pledged to remove the bulk of them by the end of July, although each state and territory is determining its own pace. 
TA said data from its “Book a Court” online system showed a record 32,234 bookings made last month, with traffic doubling from a year earlier among venues that were using the system in May 2019. 
“During the pandemic, we are seeing more people enjoying the social, mental and physical benefits of (tennis) while maintaining strict physical distancing measures,” TA chief executive Craig Tiley said in a statement. 
“As restrictions in most of the country continue to ease over the coming months, we hope to build on these results as we approach our summer.”

On Saturday, Ireland reported 23 new infections, the highest number of new cases for two weeks, with six deaths. That brought the total death toll in the country of 4.9 million since the start of the pandemic to 1,734. 
Holohan, who has cited anecdotal evidence in recent days of young people socialising in large numbers, said 10 of the 23 cases were in adults under the age of 35 and eight were between 35 and 54. 
“This is now a real concern and a worrying trend at a time when many people are reconnecting with friends and loved ones and may be gathering in larger groups,” Holohan said.

Cruise liners carrying thousands of passengers regularly stop off at ports in the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Barcelona and Malaga, but were prohibited when Spain went into lockdown on March 14. 
With their crowds of often elderly passengers, cruise ships have been especially vulnerable to outbreaks of the virus and have been barred from disembarking in several countries. 
Spain’s ban on the vessels will continue until the coronavirus epidemic is brought under control, according to the Official State Gazette, even as the country otherwise reopens to tourists in an effort to revive an industry hammered by the coronavirus lockdown. 
The retention of the ban was described as a “proportionate, objective and non-discriminatory measure that is in line with the objective set by the WHO Emergency Committee to stop the spread of the virus”, the order said, referring to the World Health Organization. 
Cruise liners form part of Spain’s tourist sector which contributes 12% of GDP. In 2019 10 million cruise line passengers visited Spain.

The union’s chief medical officer had previously said that players should avoid practicing together but top players, including quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Tom Brady, posted images and videos on social media that showed them flouting the advisory and practicing with team mates last week. 
“Those practices are not in the best interest of player safety,” NFLPA Executive Director Smith told USA Today’s SportsPulse program. 
“They’re not in the best interest of protecting our players heading into training camp and I don’t think they are in the best interest of us getting through an entire season.” 
The league has not explicitly banned private group workouts but Smith said they had the potential to complicate negotiations between the player group and the NFL, as the two parties chart a path forward in the COVID-19 era. 
“We have to negotiate with the league about what happens to a player if they test positive during the season,” said Smith. 
“Does that player go on injured reserve? Do they go on short-term IR? If you test positive for the virus after training camp is that a work-related injury? 
“All of the things that players may want to do during the off-season have a direct impact on how well we can negotiate protections for them once the season starts.” 
The NFL has pushed forward with plans to kick off the regular season on Sept. 10 but last week was forced to postpone its Aug. 6 NFL Hall of Fame exhibition game, the curtain-raiser to the football season, by a year due to the new coronavirus.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro has identified Zulia as an epicenter of the pandemic, with official statistics showing 590 cases and 10 deaths in the sweltering border state that shares a frontier with neighboring Colombia. 
But opposition leaders have questioned the official figures, noting a lack of transparency in the reporting of cases and persecution of reporters, doctors and nurses who have contradicted the authorities. 
“There are more deaths from coronavirus than the regime is announcing,” said Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition legislator who represents the state of Zulia. “The figures they are presenting are not credible.” 
Venezuela’s information ministry and the Zulia government did not reply to requests for comment for this story. 
Officials say many of the cases originated in a sprawling food market that supplies much of Maracaibo, the Zulia state capital and Venezuela’s second city. Known as the Maracaibo Flea Market, it has long been known for its overcrowding and poor sanitation. 
Venezuela on Monday reported 4,048 cases of coronavirus and 35 associated deaths. 
In some cases, patients die of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but their death certificates only refer to pneumonia or other ailments, according to two Zulia health workers. 
The country no longer publishes epidemiological data, leaving no way to compare current death rates of pneumonia with those of previous years. 
Earlier this month, 20 people diagnosed with coronavirus demanded to be released from forced quarantine at the University Hospital of Maracaibo, complaining about lack of food and running water. 
When staff refused, the patients said they were leaving anyway - and threatened to cough on or touch anyone who attempted to stop them, according to a doctor and a nurse with knowledge of the incident. 
Lacking protective equipment to prevent infection, the hospital staff had little choice but to let them out. 
The hospital did not respond to a request for comment. 
“Medical staff make four dollars (per month). They’re not going to risk getting sick for the little money that they make,” said one doctor, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. 
Zulia has been among states hardest hit by Venezuela’s crumbling power and water services, hampering efforts to maintain basic sanitation even in hospitals. 
Maduro says Venezuela has managed the outbreak better than other Latin American nations. He points to lower infection and death figures and insists that most cases can be traced to migrants returning from Colombia and Brazil. 
But the Zulia state doctors’ association on Sunday issued a statement denouncing insufficient hospital beds and supplies, limited use of face masks in public spaces, and the use of low-budget hotels to quarantine COVID-19 patients. 
“The hospital is totally contaminated. Nobody knows who has COVID-19 and who doesn’t,” said one health worker at the University Hospital of Maracaibo who asked not to be identified. 
“Every floor is full of people, and they aren’t doing anything about it.”

At 0530 GMT, the rand was 0.17% firmer at 17.2100 per U.S. dollar versus an overnight close of 17.2400 in New York, matching advances by other emerging currencies as upbeat data in Europe bolstered hopes for a global economic recovery. 
The special budget, brought forward by the treasury in response to the coronavirus outbreak and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 500 billion rand ($29 billion) stimulus package, is set to show ballooning deficit and debt in Africa’s most advanced economy. 
But some traders said South Africa’s economic crisis was already know, with growth already in contraction in the last two quarters of 2019, and that investors were instead looking to cash-in on the high yield on the rand and local bonds. 
That enthusiasm will be tested by the budget speech due at 1300 GMT, with a Reuters poll predicting a deficit widening to a record 14% of gross domestic product and an economic contraction of at least 6.5%. 
“The emergency budget is likely to prove another disappointment to markets on Wednesday. Tax revenues have collapsed, foreign tourism is non-existent and debt ratios should reach record highs over the upcoming years,” Deutsche Bank’s analysts wrote in a note. 
“While the market has certainly gotten used to disappointing budget updates, we think, the extent of deterioration in fiscal ratios will have an adverse impact on South Africa markets.” 
Before the budget the national statistics agency publishes consumer inflation and retail trade data.

Clinical trials are underway for more than a dozen potential vaccines, including at least six in China, but Japan’s first human trials are expected to start next month. 
In development of treatments, Russia and India approved Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s (4901.T) Avigan as a COVID-19 therapy, but Japan, whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has touted the drug’s potential and hoped to approve it in May, won’t see a decision until at least July. 
“Due to the decreasing number of coronavirus infections, we believe it will take some time before clinical research is completed,” said Tetsuya Nakamura, who is running a trial of Avigan at Gunma University Hospital in central Japan. 
“It’s a pity that Avigan has been approved overseas but not in Japan.” 
Japan has fared better than most developed nations in tackling the disease that has killed more than 470,000 worldwide. While the epidemic drove Japan’s medical system to the brink of collapse in recent months, serious cases now number about 60 nationwide. 
Some 54 COVID-19 related clinical trials have been launched in Japan, but most are still in the patient recruitment phase, according to trials’ tracking data. 
Interest in Avigan, known generically as favipiravir, soared in March after a Chinese official said it appeared to help patients recover from COVID-19. It is now the subject of at least 25 clinical trials around the world. 
The regulatory delay on Avigan is partly due to the fact that the studies should have been carried out in multiple countries at once, said Dr. Nakamura. But such studies are “enormously expensive.” 
Fujifilm said it is working to complete the clinical trials “as soon as possible.” 
Japanese biotech firm Healios KK (4593.T) said in April it intended to add COVID-19 patients to its experimental lung therapy trial but has not enlisted any as yet. 
“We were careful to size the cohort in light of the low number of patients in Japan, and so are only seeking to enroll around five patients,” CFO Richard Kincaid said. 
With a dearth of domestic patients, Japan may have to rely more on overseas data and results to aid in regulatory approvals. That practice is common “if the quality of data is considered to be good enough,” according to health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara. 
Sahara did not comment on the Russia or Indian approvals of Avigan and whether data from those nations could be used in Japan. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Japan’s primary drug regulator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Barca needed a late goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic to see off a determined Athletic side and although they picked up a third win in four matches since the season re-started, they again failed to sparkle. 
“When teams offer you little space you have to be very precise and agile and we have been lacking that since we returned,” Setien told a virtual news conference. 
“It’s not been easy and we are missing something overall, a bit of spark. Our opponents have a lot to do with this because they are sticking together and leaving hardly any space and we’re finding it hard to open them up. 
“But I think we’ll start to find it easier the more the season goes on.” 
Barca thrashed Real Mallorca 4-0 on their return after the long break but looked rusty in last week’s 2-0 victory over struggling Leganes and on Friday were held 0-0 at Sevilla, allowing Real Madrid to go top of the league on Sunday.

His team last week secured their eighth successive league crown and despite still fighting for a treble of titles, Bayern should expect their annual turnover of more than 700 million euros ($790.44 million) to drop by about 50 million due to the pandemic, Rummenigge said. 
The Bundesliga was suspended for more than two months in March following the spread of the virus across the globe, restarting without fans in May as clubs’ revenues continued to drop. 
“Football must try to become a bit more rational in order to be better prepared for future crisis,” Rummenigge told Handeslblatt newspaper on Tuesday. 
“In the past decade football, with higher-faster-longer when it came to transfer fees and player salaries, went a considerable way beyond its target. We delivered a breath-taking competition for transfers that cannot be called rational any more.” 
While Bayern had traditionally avoided paying high prices for players, they also joined the big spenders last year, forking out a league record 80 million euros for defender Lucas Hernandez, who spent much of the season injured. 
There will also be less money available from broadcasters in the coming years, with the German Football League announcing on Monday domestic rights deals worth 4.4 billion from the 2021-22 season for four years. 
It is less lucrative than the existing four-year deal that ends next season and is worth 4.6 billion euros. 
In the coming season fans should not expect any big spending as clubs undergo cost-cutting operations, Rummenigge said. 
“The transfer market has changed. There is not a lot of liquidity around and so there is a lack of demand. But there is no lack of supply for players eager to transfer,” he said. 
“That will create adjustments to the prices, and the salaries are also hardly going to go up and that is the case for top players as well. Many top European clubs have announced intentions to decrease their payroll. We will also be treating this more carefully.”

Barca needed a late goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic to see off a determined Athletic side and although they picked up a third win in four matches since the season re-started, they again failed to sparkle. 
“When teams offer you little space you have to be very precise and agile and we have been lacking that since we returned,” Setien told a virtual news conference. 
“It’s not been easy and we are missing something overall, a bit of spark. Our opponents have a lot to do with this because they are sticking together and leaving hardly any space and we’re finding it hard to open them up. 
“But I think we’ll start to find it easier the more the season goes on.” 
Barca thrashed Real Mallorca 4-0 on their return after the long break but looked rusty in last week’s 2-0 victory over struggling Leganes and on Friday were held 0-0 at Sevilla, allowing Real Madrid to go top of the league on Sunday. 
The win over Athletic took Barca three points ahead of Madrid but Zinedine Zidane’s side will go back to the top of the table with victory over Real Mallorca on Wednesday.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro has identified Zulia as an epicenter of the pandemic, with official statistics showing 590 cases and 10 deaths in the sweltering border state that shares a frontier with neighboring Colombia. 
But opposition leaders have questioned the official figures, noting a lack of transparency in the reporting of cases and persecution of reporters, doctors and nurses who have contradicted the authorities. 
“There are more deaths from coronavirus than the regime is announcing,” said Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition legislator who represents the state of Zulia. “The figures they are presenting are not credible.” 
Venezuela’s information ministry and the Zulia government did not reply to requests for comment for this story. 
Officials say many of the cases originated in a sprawling food market that supplies much of Maracaibo, the Zulia state capital and Venezuela’s second city. Known as the Maracaibo Flea Market, it has long been known for its overcrowding and poor sanitation. 
Venezuela on Monday reported 4,048 cases of coronavirus and 35 associated deaths. 
In some cases, patients die of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but their death certificates only refer to pneumonia or other ailments, according to two Zulia health workers. 
The country no longer publishes epidemiological data, leaving no way to compare current death rates of pneumonia with those of previous years. 
Earlier this month, 20 people diagnosed with coronavirus demanded to be released from forced quarantine at the University Hospital of Maracaibo, complaining about lack of food and running water. 
When staff refused, the patients said they were leaving anyway - and threatened to cough on or touch anyone who attempted to stop them, according to a doctor and a nurse with knowledge of the incident. 
Lacking protective equipment to prevent infection, the hospital staff had little choice but to let them out. 
The hospital did not respond to a request for comment. 
“Medical staff make four dollars (per month). They’re not going to risk getting sick for the little money that they make,” said one doctor, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. 
Zulia has been among states hardest hit by Venezuela’s crumbling power and water services, hampering efforts to maintain basic sanitation even in hospitals. 
Maduro says Venezuela has managed the outbreak better than other Latin American nations. He points to lower infection and death figures and insists that most cases can be traced to migrants returning from Colombia and Brazil. 
But the Zulia state doctors’ association on Sunday issued a statement denouncing insufficient hospital beds and supplies, limited use of face masks in public spaces, and the use of low-budget hotels to quarantine COVID-19 patients. 
“The hospital is totally contaminated. Nobody knows who has COVID-19 and who doesn’t,” said one health worker at the University Hospital of Maracaibo who asked not to be identified. 
“Every floor is full of people, and they aren’t doing anything about it.”

Regardless of whether they eventually win it at home or away, the celebrations that marked their Anfield victory over Queens Park Rangers that won the league in 1990 will not be repeated. 
With games currently taking place behind closed doors and large gatherings prohibited, fans will have to find novel ways of marking the occasion. 
“For many of us, this has been a party that has been three decades in the making, so everyone has their own idea of what they plan to do,” Liverpool fan and co-founder of The Anfield Wrap podcast Gareth Roberts told Reuters.  
“Some have a special cigar that they’re going to smoke, or a bottle of champagne or wine that they’ve been saving all these years that they’re going to crack open.  
“There’s another lad who said he just wants to sit in a tree and watch the world go by with Liverpool as champions!” he added. 
Liverpool hold a 20-point lead over second-placed Manchester City with eight games of the campaign remaining. 
If they beat Crystal Palace at home on Wednesday, they could wrap up the title as early as Thursday, providing City drop points at Chelsea. 
Roberts said that fans all over the world have been in touch with him to talk about how they will toast the team when the long title drought ends. 
Among the fans eager to celebrate is Sweden’s ex-Liverpool defender Glenn Hysen, who played in the last league-winning Reds team. 
He had planned to be in England in his capacity as ambassador for Sweden’s Liverpool fans, but those plans were scuppered by travel restrictions due to the virus. 
Instead, he and his fellow Swedish Liverpool fans will get together in the city of Gothenburg where he now lives to watch the remaining matches. 
“We have booked a beer-tasting the night Liverpool play City, so hopefully they can win it then,” the jovial 60-year-old told Reuters with a laugh. 
“Either way, we’ll be all-in!”

Testing to find the virus before patients spread it further is key to controlling the pandemic, especially as lockdowns lift. The Arizona delays - in testing and results reporting - are similar to problems seen earlier in the epidemic, and some labs across the country are facing shortages of supplies, an industry group said. 
In Arizona, Roche Holding recently told Sonora Quest lab, a joint venture between Phoenix-based Banner Health and Quest Diagnostics, that a new instrument it had hoped to get in June would not be delivered until August, said Sonora Chief Operating Officer Sonya Engle. 
“The testing demand has increased significantly,” said Engle, whose lab is responsible for approximately 80% of Arizona COVID-19 tests. “We have reached record highs each day in the past couple weeks.” 
On Friday, she said, the lab received a record 12,000 test orders, double its capacity. It is aiming to ramp up to 17,000 a day but is still working on a deal with a new supplier to make that possible. 
Roche said in response to a request from Reuters that it has been ramping up production since March and is committed to delivering as many tests as possible to the most affected areas, including Arizona. 
“At the height of this global pandemic, demand for diagnostic tests and the instruments to conduct them continues to outstrip supply,” the company said on Tuesday in a statement. 
Last week the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, which represents clinical lab workers and researchers, wrote to Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, urging her to “use the authority of the federal government to obtain and allocate these vital supplies.” 
In a May survey of 100 labs, 50% said they continued to have difficulty getting the swabs, reagents or test kits they needed, according to the letter, which has not been published previously. 
The White House referred questions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which did not immediately respond. 
Arizona, Florida and Texas are all experiencing record surges in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis. Arizona reported 17,000 new cases last week, a 90% increase, with 20% of tests coming back positive. 
The major suppliers to U.S. labs, including Roche and Abbott, sell both lab equipment and proprietary chemicals called reagent kits that are specific to their equipment. When reagent runs low, labs generally cannot switch suppliers. 
In recent days, some free testing sites in Arizona have had to turn patients away because of rising demand, according to local media reports. The Arizona Republic reported that some people had waited as long as 13 hours at one site in Phoenix on Saturday. 
Engle said patients have waited five to six days for results, up from two to three days in May.

World number one Novak Djokovic confirmed he had contracted COVID-19 on Tuesday, becoming the fourth player infected during the Balkan series, which featured heaving crowds and players partying without social distancing. 
“There were a fair few learnings that have come out of that (Adria Tour),” TA’s Chief Operating Officer Tom Larner said. 
“And whilst, certainly the whole event was actually really well-intentioned in terms of raising money for charity, the execution was clearly not great, as were the processes in place.” 
The U.S. Open is the next Grand Slam on the calendar, to be held as scheduled from Aug. 31 in New York, with no crowds and under strict biosecurity protocols. 
Australia, with 7,500 infections and 103 deaths, has been relatively successful in containing COVID-19 but fears of a second wave are growing with several clusters breaking out across Melbourne, the Australian Open’s home city. 
Professional tennis returns in Australia this weekend with the A$450,000 ($311,000) UTR Pro Series and TA are taking no chances. The series will be held at closed venues and players interaction will be limited, measures that could be in place at Melbourne Park in January if necessary. 
“I think it will be great preparation for us and the playing group,” Larner said of planning for the series. 
“We obviously knew, as the government indicated, that there’s a risk of the virus flaring up again in Australia. 
“We’ve been working with our chief medical officer Carolyn Broderick in the development of our biosecurity plan ... how we keep players safe and how we ensure there’s minimal cross-over or interaction.” 
Social restrictions have eased in Australia but Victoria has reimposed some after the COVID-19 spike in Melbourne. 
Sports events in Victoria remain closed to the public but other states with lower infection rates are allowed to have crowds of up to 20,000 attend venues. 
Larner said Australian Open organisers had no scenario planning which involved moving the Grand Slam or other warmup events to other parts of the country to reduce COVID-19 risks or give fans access to tennis. 
He added that organisers were confident they could allow fans to safely attend the Australian Open even without COVID-19 being eradicated in Melbourne so long as their movement and spacing could be controlled effectively. 
On the players’ side TA have had positive feedback, Larner said. 
“With some doubt around the back end of the season, we’ve had a lot of players talk to us about coming out to Australia early in December or even November to actually go through whatever quarantining is required at that point of time,” he said. 
“What we’ll see, hopefully, is actually really strong player fields leading into the Australian Open.”

The post, uploaded on June 18 by a Texas-based Facebook user, specifically claims that four children have died “immediately” after being given the vaccine, which it says will contain radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. 
It adds that this vaccine will be mandatory for children to take before they can return to school and serves as a warning to homeschool your kids ( here ). 
These claims are false. There are currently no approved vaccines for COVID-19, and Reuters has previously debunked claims of a plan to administer RFID microchips inside them ( here ). 
Reuters has also previously debunked claims of children dying in Africa after being given a COVID-19 vaccine ( here , here ). 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are currently 142 potential vaccines being developed across the world, 13 of which are undergoing human trials. Four of the candidate vaccines at the human trial stage involve American companies or bodies. Researchers in these four trials are only accepting candidates over 18 years of age. ( here ). 
If and when a vaccine against COVID-19 is eventually approved, it will be up to individual state authorities in the U.S. to determine whether administering it should be mandatory. For the purposes of this post, which was uploaded by a user in Texas, the Texas Department of State Health Services told Reuters that it would be false to say children would not be allowed to return to school without being vaccinated. 
VERDICT 
False. A COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been approved, nor is there evidence that a vaccine once developed will contain an RFID microchip. Candidate vaccines being tested at the human trial stage in the United States are currently being tested on adults only.

Djokovic was criticised for hosting the tournament amid a pandemic after Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also returned positive tests after playing in the tournament that was held in Serbia and Croatia. [nL8N2E03KO][nL4N2DZ262] 
Following is a list of quotes from the 17-times Grand Slam champion on tennis, the pandemic, vaccines and more: 
Djokovic on testing positive for COVID-19 (June 23): 
“The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as (wife) Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative. 
“I’m extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and that everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days.” 
Djokovic on mandatory coronavirus vaccinations (April 19): 
“Personally I’m opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel. 
“But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I’ll have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.” 
Djokovic on the power of positive emotions (May 6): 
“This is something that is not linked to any form of official way of presenting nutrition and how you should eat and drink. 
“I know some people that, through energetic transformation, through the power of prayer, through the power of gratitude, they managed to turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water. 
“Scientists have proven that in (an) experiment, that molecules in the water react to our emotions to what has been said.” 
Djokovic on the U.S. Open’s strict protocols (June 6): 
“The rules that they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme. We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week. 
“Also, we could bring one person to the club which is really impossible. I mean, you need your coach, then a fitness trainer, then a physiotherapist.” 
Djokovic on staging an exhibition tournament in Serbia amid the pandemic (June 12): 
“We have different circumstances and measures (to other countries) so it’s very difficult to think of international standards (regarding the pandemic). 
“We’ve had better numbers compared to some other countries. Of course, lives have been lost and that’s horrible to see, in the region and worldwide. But life goes on and we as athletes are looking forward to competing. 
“You can also criticise us and say this is maybe dangerous but it’s not up to me to make the calls what is right or wrong health-wise. We are doing what the Serbian government is telling us and hopefully we soon will get back on tour collectively.” 
Djokovic on the prospect of the U.S. Open going ahead and the ATP Tour’s resumption (June 18): 
“Hopefully every single player who is participating, chosen by ranking and who deserves their place at the U.S. Open, will have an equal opportunity to travel there and compete as everybody else. 
“I’m extremely happy and excited to see that all the tournaments, especially Grand Slams, are organising their events. 
“I think that a lot of people were sceptical, especially for the U.S. events considering what the U.S. went through as a country during this pandemic. So a lot of people, including myself, were quite sceptical on whether it would happen or not.”

The nationalisation of the loss-making business comes after 11 troubled years of private management and three failed restructuring attempts. 
The government injected 400 million euros into Alitalia at the beginning of this year, after granting a bridge loan of 900 million euros in 2017, which was not paid back. 
“As of May 31 the company had 232 million euros in liquidity ... revenue between January and May amounted to 505 million,” Patuanelli told a parliamentary hearing. 
In the same period last year, the carrier recorded 1.1 billion euros in revenues. 
Transport Minister Paola De Micheli, also addressing parliament on the nationalisation plan, said the government would invest in planes, “particularly for long-haul” flights. 
Rome said last month, as it eased a three-month coronavirus lockdown, that it would inject at least 3 billion euros of fresh capital into Alitalia to relaunch it as a new public company. 
The government planned to nationalise the carrier in early June, but the project has not taken shape yet and the ministers did not give a time frame on Tuesday. 
“We are re-designing an entire sector of national transport ... (Alitalia) cannot be a small-scale company,” De Micheli told lawmakers. 
Rome’s Fiumicino airport, which is run by infrastructure group Atlantia (ATL.MI), will remain key, she said, adding the carrier’s new industrial plan would also envisage investments in Milan’s Malpensa airport for long-haul flights. 
“We need to reduce the average age of our planes, allowing major savings on fuel and a reduction of the environmental impact and maintenance costs,” De Micheli said. 
The ministers gave no information on potential partners for the new airline. Alitalia’s previous alliances with Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) expired last month.

“We always have to keep the big picture in mind. Europe wants to become the first greenhouse gas-neutral continent by 2050. This is the most crucial thing that we can do for future generations,” Svenja Schulze said ahead of a meeting of EU environment ministers. 
Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency on July 1 and will chair meetings of EU ministers until the end of the year. 
The European Commission has said spending from its proposed 750 billion euro ($846.38 billion) coronavirus recovery fund must “do no harm” to the bloc’s green goals. It has earmarked funding for electric vehicles and low-carbon hydrogen fuel - areas also in line for support from Germany’s national stimulus package. 
Schulze called the Commission proposal a “good basis” for the EU’s economic recovery, which she said must be “socially fair and ecologically sound”. 
She said priorities during Germany’s presidency would be agreeing an EU biodiversity strategy, a law to make long-term emissions targets legally binding, and increasing the bloc’s 2030 climate target to a 50% or 55% emissions reduction against 1990 levels. 
Tough talks lie ahead. Bulgaria said on Tuesday it could not achieve a higher 2030 climate goal, while Slovenia called the Commission’s biodiversity plan to protect 30% of EU land “rather impossible”. 
The EU had hoped to coax China, the world’s biggest emitter, into raising its emissions-cutting ambitions at a joint summit in Leipzig in September, ahead of a crucial U.N. climate summit in November. 
But with both events delayed, the EU’s immediate climate focus has shifted to rebuilding its virus-battered economy without compromising its green goals.

“We know COVID-19 has not gone away. We implore you to take responsible actions practice appropriate social distancing, wear a mask or face covering anytime you leave your home,” the Texas Children’s Hospital said in a statement, without specifying how many coronavirus patients they admitted. 
Texas reported over 5,000 new infections on Monday, a single-day record for the state. It has also seen COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record highs for 11 days in a row. 
Arizona and Nevada reported record increases in new cases on Tuesday after recording all-time highs last week, according to a Reuters tally. 
The United States recorded a 25% increase in new cases of COVID-19 in the week ended June 21, compared to the previous seven days, as Arizona and Florida joined Texas with record surges in new infections, a Reuters analysis found. 
Ten states, including Texas, reported weekly new infection increases of more than 50%, according to the analysis of data from The COVID Tracking Project https://covidtracking.com, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
While most states are increasing testing, the number of tests coming back positive is rising. At least four states are averaging double-digit rates in the percentage of tests that are positive for the virus: Arizona at 20%, Florida and Utah both at 11%, and Texas at 10%. By contrast, New York, formerly the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has been reporting positive test rates of around 1%. 
The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday held fast to his claim that the spike in U.S. cases in multiple states was due to testing, not increased spread of the disease. 
“Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!” he tweeted. 
Many of these states are also seeing record hospitalizations - a metric not affected by increased testing. 
The president will speak with students in Phoenix on Tuesday after holding his first campaign rally in months in Oklahoma over the weekend. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to challenge Trump in the Nov. 3 election, called the president’s plans to speak to thousands of supporters in Phoenix “reckless and irresponsible” at a time when the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Arizona is continuing to rise.

The deal strengthens Sanofi’s credentials in a market engaged in a frantic race to find a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus disease that has killed more than 472,000 worldwide. 
The companies said they would expand their partnership to develop a wide range of mRNA vaccines. The mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, an area of Translate Bio expertise, instructs human cells to make specific proteins that produce an immune response to a disease. 
The deal will give Sanofi about 7.2% of Translate Bio and exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and sell infectious disease vaccines using the U.S. company’s technology. 
Sanofi expects its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate to enter clinical trials by the end of the year and, if successful, gain regulatory approval in the second half of 2021. 
The group is also working on another COVID-19 vaccine with Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), targeting approval in the first half of next year. 
Translate Bio, meanwhile, will receive an upfront payment of $425 million, comprising $300 million in cash and a common stock investment of $125 million through a private placement at $25.59 per share - a 57.6% premium to Monday’s closing price of $16.24. 
The U.S. biotech specialist will also be eligible for further potential milestone and other payments of up to $1.9 billion, the companies said. 
The deal makes Sanofi its fourth-largest shareholder, Refinitiv data shows. 
Sanofi last month sold most of its 20.6% stake in U.S. partner Regeneron (REGN.O) for more than $11 billion and said it would use the money for innovation and general growth, with financial sources telling Reuters they expected the group to engage in a series of smaller deals rather than a large acquisition.

Representatives of EU states and the European Parliament cited “adverse circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic”, a statement from the Council of EU states said. 
The rules would allow market participants to choose where they want to clear their listed derivatives trades, pitting clearers like the London Stock Exchange’s (LSE.L) LCH, Deutsche Boerse’s (DB1Gn.DE) Eurex, and ICE (ICE.N) against each other. 
The rules, part of the EU’s MiFID II securities law, were due to come into force on July 4 and will now be delayed a year until July 4, 2021. 
They were controversial in the making, with lawmakers’ concerns over the potential impact on financial stability disputed by proponents of greater competition in markets. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority said on June 11 that market disruption from COVID-19 could increase operational risks by limiting the capacity of clearers to assess access requests and manage the migration of transactions. 
Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said it backed ESMA’s stance. 
Clearing houses ensure a securities transaction is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust.

World number one Novak Djokovic confirmed he had contracted COVID-19 on Tuesday, becoming the fourth player infected during the Balkan series, which featured heaving crowds and players partying without social distancing. 
“There were a fair few learnings that have come out of that (Adria Tour),” TA’s Chief Operating Officer Tom Larner said. 
“And whilst, certainly the whole event was actually really well-intentioned in terms of raising money for charity, the execution was clearly not great, as were the processes in place.” 
The U.S. Open is the next Grand Slam on the calendar, to be held as scheduled from Aug. 31 in New York, with no crowds and under strict biosecurity protocols. 
Australia, with 7,500 infections and 103 deaths, has been relatively successful in containing COVID-19 but fears of a second wave are growing with several clusters breaking out across Melbourne, the Australian Open’s home city. 
Professional tennis returns in Australia this weekend with the A$450,000 ($311,000) UTR Pro Series and TA are taking no chances. The series will be held at closed venues and players interaction will be limited, measures that could be in place at Melbourne Park in January if necessary. 
“I think it will be great preparation for us and the playing group,” Larner said of planning for the series. 
“We obviously knew, as the government indicated, that there’s a risk of the virus flaring up again in Australia. 
“We’ve been working with our chief medical officer Carolyn Broderick in the development of our biosecurity plan ... how we keep players safe and how we ensure there’s minimal cross-over or interaction.” 
Social restrictions have eased in Australia but Victoria has reimposed some after the COVID-19 spike in Melbourne. 
Sports events in Victoria remain closed to the public but other states with lower infection rates are allowed to have crowds of up to 20,000 attend venues. 
Larner said Australian Open organisers had no scenario planning which involved moving the Grand Slam or other warmup events to other parts of the country to reduce COVID-19 risks or give fans access to tennis. 
He added that organisers were confident they could allow fans to safely attend the Australian Open even without COVID-19 being eradicated in Melbourne so long as their movement and spacing could be controlled effectively. 
On the players’ side TA have had positive feedback, Larner said. 
“With some doubt around the back end of the season, we’ve had a lot of players talk to us about coming out to Australia early in December or even November to actually go through whatever quarantining is required at that point of time,” he said. 
“What we’ll see, hopefully, is actually really strong player fields leading into the Australian Open.”

The Cup of Nations is set for Cameroon from Jan 9-Feb 6 but appears increasingly under threat as time begins to run out. Qualifying is still far from complete and national team football on the continent is not due to resume before October in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
CAF’s executive committee will meet in an online conference on Tuesday to decide what to do, and also set out a possible process for completing this season’s two continental club competitions. 
FIFA’s decision on Thursday to cancel September’s window for national team matches in all regions, except Europe and South America, has left CAF with fewer dates to try and complete the competition’s qualifying campaign and the finalise the field for the 24-team tournament. 
There are still four rounds of qualifiers to play and although they could yet be scheduled for October and November, that would mean having to postpone the start of the group phase of 2022 World Cup qualifiers. 
There is also the squeeze that hosting the Cup of Nations next January would place on domestic competition, with the 2020-21 season in most of Africa’s major leagues set to start late as they seek to first complete current campaigns which have been suspended by the pandemic. Most African leagues are halted mid-season to make space for the Cup of Nations. 
“The Cup of Nations could be pushed back by 12 months,” a senior official told Reuters, asking not to be identified, although general secretary Abdelmounaim Bah told reporters last week the best option remained its current dates. 
CREATIVE PLAN 
The African Champions League and African Confederation Cup were suspended at the semi-final stage and CAF will have to come up with a creative plan to finish the competitions with borders mostly shut, flights suspended and football stopped across the continent because of the pandemic. 
CAF must also decide whether to cancel this year’s African Nations Championship, which was due to be played in Cameroon in April. It is the tournament hosted every two years for quasi national teams made up of home based players only. 
A decision must also be made on the African women’s championship, scheduled for November but with qualification also far from complete. 
But in this case, a postponement looks an easy decision to make because CAF have yet to find a venue for the tournament after Congo withdrew as hosts in July last year.

The discovery of virus genome presence so early in Spain, if confirmed, would imply the disease may have appeared much earlier than the scientific community thought. 
The University of Barcelona team, who had been testing waste water since mid-April this year to identify potential new outbreaks, decided to also run tests on older samples. 
They first found the virus was present in Barcelona on Jan. 15, 2020, 41 days before the first case was officially reported there. 
Then they ran tests on samples taken between January 2018 and December 2019 and found the presence of the virus genome in one of them, collected on March 12, 2019. 
“The levels of SARS-CoV-2 were low but were positive,” research leader Albert Bosch was quoted as saying by the university. 
The research has been submitted for a peer review. 
Dr Joan Ramon Villalbi of the Spanish Society for Public Health and Sanitary Administration told Reuters it was still early to draw definitive conclusions. 
“When it’s just one result, you always want more data, more studies, more samples to confirm it and rule out a laboratory error or a methodological problem,” he said. 
There was the potential for a false positive due to the virus’ similarities with other respiratory infections. 
“But it’s definitely interesting, it’s suggestive,” Villalbi said. 
Bosch, who is president of the Spanish Society of Virologists, said that an early detection even in January could have improved the response to the pandemic. Instead, patients were probably misdiagnosed with common flu, contributing to community transmission before measures were taken. 
Prof. Gertjan Medema of the KWR Water Research Institute in the Netherlands, whose team began using a coronavirus test on waste water in February, suggested the Barcelona group needs to repeat the tests to confirm it is really the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The only other drug the medical group recommends for COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial is remdesivir, the intravenous antiviral medication made by Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O). 
The IDSA late on Thursday said its change was based on recent data from a United Kingdom study showing that a low-cost and widely used steroid called dexamethasone reduced death rates by around a third among the most severely ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
The group now suggests dexamethasone, or an equivalent steroid such as methylprednisolone or prednisone, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation (ECMO). The IDSA does not recommend steroids for COVID-19 patients who do not require supplemental oxygen. 
In patients with severe COVID-19, the immune system can overreact, triggering a potentially harmful cascade. Steroids are an older class of drugs used to suppress that inflammatory response, but they can also make it easier for other infections to take hold - and doctors are leery of their use in a hospital setting, or in patients in earlier stages of the illness when they body’s immune response needs to be on high alert. 
The IDSA recommends remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, but supplies of the antiviral drug are tight. The guidelines note that remdesivir appears to offer the most benefit for patients who need oxygen, but are not on a ventilator or ECMO. 
Gilead has not yet set a price for remdesivir, which has been available on a limited basis through company donations, compassionate use requests and clinical trials. 
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review this week suggested a price range for remdesivir of $2,520 to $2,800 per treatment course if dexamethasone becomes a standard treatment for COVID-19. The U.S. price for dexamethasone is around $15 for a 10-day course of treatment.

Renewing its call on Friday for global collaboration against the pandemic, it said $3.4 billion had been contributed for the coalition to date, leaving a funding gap of $27.9 billion. Of that, $13.7 billion was “urgently needed”. 
The WHO is working with a large coalition of drug-development, funding and distribution organisations under what it calls the ACT-Accelerator Hub. 
The initiative is intended to develop and deliver 500 million COVID-19 tests and 245 million courses of new treatment for the disease to low- and middle-income countries by mid-2021, it said in a statement. 
It also hoping 2 billion vaccines doses, including 1 billion to be bought by low- and middle-income countries, will be available by the end of 2021. 
“SIGNIFICANT” INVESTMENT REQUIRED 
The ACT-Accelerator was launched in April to speed up research and development work on medical tools to tackle COVID-19. On Friday, the WHO said the pandemic was still threatening millions of lives and scores of economies, and urgent work and funds were needed. 
“The investment required is significant, but it pales in significance when compared to the cost of COVID-19,” it said. 
“The total cost of the ACT-Accelerator’s work is less than a tenth of what the IMF estimates the global economy is losing every month due to the pandemic. 468,000 thousand people have already lost their lives.” 
As the race to find a vaccine has accelerated, governments including the United States and in Europe, have rushed to agree advance purchases of promising coronavirus immunisation treatments. 
That has raised concerns about the equitable distribution of and access to supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, particularly for lower- and middle-income countries. 
WHO chief scientist Souma Swaminathan said the programme had had “really very constructive” engagement with companies about the involvement of the private sector.

Spikes of cases in several U.S. states including Texas, Arizona and Florida are raising concerns that the United States is relaxing lockdowns too fast and that hospitals may run out of space. Houston has considered turning part of a local stadium complex into excess hospital capacity - but local officials say that’s not currently part of their immediate plans. 
The Texas Medical Center system in Houston was expected to fill its last ICU bed on Thursday, but it has created a COVID “war room” and can handle a 66% surge in additional ICU patients with strategies including reassigning staff, delaying elective procedures, putting beds closer together and using regular beds for emergency use. 
They calculate they will run out of space on July 6 if the current increase in Texas severe cases continues. 
The ICU at nearby Houston Methodist was also nearly full as of Thursday. They are preparing to surge, and said that their experience with coronavirus patients has helped them save beds in the hospital’s ward for the most severe cases. 
“We’re not intubating as many patients, we have lots of drugs like convalescent plasma and remdesivir, and our process of proning patients, (putting them on their stomachs) is allowing us to manage a lot more patients on acute care floors then we were able to do in March and April,” said hospital ICU chief Dr. Faisal Masud. 
In Arizona, adult intensive care beds were 88% occupied statewide as cases continued to surge. 
Arizona’s Governor Doug Ducey said on Thursday that his state has the hospital capacity to handle the influx of patients despite increasing numbers of occupied hospital beds, intensive care beds and ventilators being used. 
“Our hospitals are likely to hit surge capacity very soon,” Ducey said, adding that the state could handle the influx. “Where we are right now and what we expect is manageable.” he said. 
Arizona has the ability to reopen a shuttered hospital and open field hospitals to help handle surges in ill patients. 
In Florida, COVID hospital patients at AdventHealth Systems also are younger than earlier in the pandemic and less likely to need critical care, said Dr. Vincent Hsu, AdventHealth’s infection control officer for Florida. 
“We’re not seeing nearly as sick patients as we had in the first part (of the outbreak),” Hsu said at a news conference. “The patients that are coming in tend to be a little bit younger. And as a result, they don’t tend to utilize the significant ICU resources or the ventilator resources.” 
Ed Jimenez, chief Executive of University of Florida Health’s Shands hospital in Gainesville, said that he could cut the number of patients in his hospital by a third by stopping elective procedures. 
“So we have levers we can pull that slow down the inflow of patients,” Jimenez said.

Britain has started testing an app that matches contacts on a centralised server rather than the decentralised model favoured by Apple and Google where the matches occur on the users’ device. 
A centralised app can potentially give more insight into outbreaks of COVID-19, but offers less privacy than decentralised rivals, the UK programme’s head said earlier this month. 
Company representatives discussing the release of the Apple-Google exposure notification technology to public health authorities said they remained in conversation with Britain’s health service as it evaluated several different approaches.

The vaccine candidate, called BBIBP-CorV, induced high-level neutralising antibodies that can block the virus from infecting cells in monkeys, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, researchers said in a paper published in online by the medical journal Cell on Saturday. 
“These results support the further evaluation of BBIBP-CorV in a clinical trial,” researchers said in the paper.  
BBIBP-CorV, developed by Beijing Institute of Biological Products affiliated to state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), is among five candidates China is testing in humans. 
More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development around the world. Among front runners currently in human trials are being developed by AstraZeneca, Pfizer, BioNtech, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Sanofi and China’s CanSino Biologics. 
As well as appearing safe and able to generate an immune response in animals, BBIBP-CorV did not appear to trigger antibodies that could boost the infection - a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)- the researchers said, although this does not necessarily guarantee ADE won’t occur in human tests. 
Apart from BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm, which has invested 1 billion yuan ($141.40 million) in vaccine projects, is testing in humans another vaccine candidate developed by its Wuhan-based unit. The two shots have been given to more than 2,000 people in clinical trials.

""Department of Pharmaceuticals has approved the lifting of ban on Export of Hydroxychloroquine API as well as formulations,"" India's minister for chemicals and fertilizers, Sadananda Gowda, said here on Twitter. 
Manufacturers, except export-oriented units and those in special economic zones, would still have to supply 20% of their production to the domestic market, Gowda said. 
The country, a leading exporter of generic medicines across the world, banned the export of the drug and its formulations in March as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted supply chains. 
But India eased some of these restrictions in April and shipped 50 million tablets of the drug to the United States that month, Reuters reported. 
Trump’s championing of hydroxychloroquine had initially raised expectations for the treatment, but conflicting reports of its efficacy have added to confusion about the decades-old drug. 
British scientists last week halted a major trial after it found that the drug was “useless” at treating COVID-19 patients. 
A Lancet medical journal study that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was withdrawn a week after it led to major trials being halted. 
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said it will resume its trial of the drug for potential use against the novel coronavirus after those running the study briefly stopped giving it to new patients over health concerns. 
IPCA Laboratories and Cadila Healthcare are two leading Indian manufacturers of the drug. IPCA’s shares were down 1.2%, while Cadila’s stock was up 1% in a broader Mumbai market that was lower on Thursday. [.BO]

It has ballooned in a matter of months as hundreds of products flood the world for people who want to find out whether they’ve already had the virus. 
The problem is, some of them don’t work properly. 
As a result, European authorities aim to tighten regulation of the new sector, to weed out tests that give consistently inaccurate results and crack down on companies that make false claims, three sources familiar with the plans told Reuters. 
Much is on the line, even beyond the potential for fraud. 
Governments and companies are relying on these tests to measure how widely the virus has spread as they rush to get their economies and employees back to work and avoid a second wave of infections, even if they do not prove immunity. 
False results could undermine that effort. 
Many people have also been using kits, also known as serological or blood tests, at home or for personal checks in clinics. 
Since April the number of antibody kits carrying the region’s CE mark of quality doubled to more than 200, according to a list compiled by the EU Commission, the EU executive. 
Some of these kits are unreliable, half a dozen national regulators and industry sources across Europe told Reuters. A dozen tests have been subject to regulators’ warnings for mis-selling, including in Spain and Sweden. 
At least nine of them are no longer allowed to be sold in the United States, according to a Reuters analysis of public data from the Food and Drug Administration, which clamped down on the sector last month. 
The EU Commission is now looking at changing the self-certification regime that allows test-makers to label their products with the CE mark themselves, an EU official and two European regulatory sources told Reuters, declining to be named as the plans have not been made public. 
Among changes being examined, companies could be required to have tests reviewed by independent watchdogs before placing the CE mark on them, the sources said. 
That would mark a significant toughening of the current regime, whereby makers merely self-certify compliance with EU safety rules and supervisors can subsequently penalise them if their claims turn out to be false. 
Guidance setting out minimum performance criteria for tests could also be adopted, the two regulatory sources told Reuters. Under current rules, kits can carry a CE mark regardless of their accuracy. 
When asked about the plans, a spokesman for the Commission, the EU executive, said it was “currently considering the best way forward”. 
“We are assessing a number of different instruments available together with member states to see which action is the most appropriate,” he added. 
‘SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY’ 
Scientists have not yet definitively proven whether or how long COVID-19 survivors are immune to new infections, even if they developed antibodies. 
Nevertheless, many people are willing to pay for the tests - and many don’t come cheap, selling for anything from a few euros to more than 150 euros in some private clinics in Europe. 
It’s a potentially lucrative business: testing about 450 million people in the EU would cost billions of euros based on such prices. 
“People might be spending lots of money for nothing,” said Pauline Constant of BEUC, a European consumer organisation. 
Severin Schwan, CEO of Swiss drug giant Roche (ROG.S) which has its own antibody test, sounded an alarm in late April, when he said some tests on the market were a “disaster”. The World Health Organization also warned that tests on the market were not sufficiently reliable and could not prove immunity. 
Such comments were backed up by a study conducted by the Dutch regulator who found in May that none of 16 reviewed tests were trustworthy. 
“The test results are not reliable. The percentage of false positive and false negative results is too high,” the study concluded, without naming the manufacturers. 
“Those tests are quite meaningless,” said a spokesman for the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate, a part of the health ministry that supervises public health. 
Despite the poor results, clinics and labs in the Netherlands are still allowed to offer these tests. 
INDUSTRY BACKS RULE REVIEW 
Introducing an independent review of products would bring forward an EU reform that had been agreed before the coronavirus crisis but was not due to take effect until 2022. 
In the absence of an EU performance standard for tests, France has already set its own thresholds. About 60 kits have met the country’s requirement of at least 90% of correct positive results, a measure known as sensitivity, and 98% of correct negative results, so-called specificity. 
Under current EU rules, overseen and enforced by national watchdogs, manufacturers must seek authorisation before using the CE mark only for so-called home or self-tests, which are those who can be performed at home without professional advice. 
About a dozen antibody devices have been unlawfully marketed as CE-marked self-tests without prior authorisation, according to the Spanish and Swedish regulators. 
Low performance is not in itself illegal and has been tolerated in Europe in the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis because tests were rare. But companies cannot exaggerate the accuracy of their devices. 
An official at the Swedish regulator said the body had yet to start performance checks, while two pharmaceutical industry sources said such checks were rare in Europe. 
There is however a balance to be struck on regulation, according to industry experts who worry that if new rules are too strict or onerous they could delay the deployment of tests to conduct large-scale epidemiological surveys. 
But greater scrutiny could help improve the tarnished reputation of the sector. 
MedTechEurope, the trading body for medical technology firms including Abbott (ABT.N), Roche (ROG.S) and Siemens Healthineers (SHLG.DE), backed plans to review industry regulations. 
“We support the intention of these plans, and would welcome the opportunity to provide the industry’s input into this debate on how to best ensure only well-performing tests are on the market,” it said.

But with nonessential businesses reopening after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, deflation, a decline in the general price level, is unlikely. Still, the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday suggested the disinflationary trend could persist for a while. 
That together with a struggling labor market could see the Federal Reserve maintaining its very accommodative monetary policy stance for some time while nursing the economy back to health. Officials from the U.S. central bank were wrapping up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. 
“We expect the crisis to result in a sustained slowing in inflation due to a net increase in slack,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities in New York. “The trend in inflation was already too low from the perspective of Fed officials. The latest data help the case for Fed officials to send a dovish signal today.” 
The Labor Department said its consumer price index dipped 0.1% last month after plunging 0.8% in April, which was the largest decline since December 2008. Prices were held down by a 3.5% drop in the cost of gasoline, which followed a 20.6% plunge in April. That offset a 0.7% increase in the cost of food last month. Food prices jumped 1.5% in April. 
Prices for food consumed at home rose 1.0% after surging 2.6% in April. The cost of beef shot up a record 10.8% in May, reflecting shortages as a result of COVID-19 infections at meat processing plants. Consumers also paid more for dairy products, fruits and vegetables. But cereals and bakery products were cheaper last month. 
In the 12 months through May, the CPI edged up 0.1%. That was the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2015 and followed a 0.3% increase in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would be unchanged in May and gain 0.2% year-on-year. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared on Monday that the economy slipped into recession in February. 
The Labor Department said in-store data collection had remained suspended since March 16 because of risks of exposure to COVID-19. The department added that data collection last month was also impacted “by the temporary closing or limited operations of certain types of establishments,” leading to “an increase in the number of prices being considered temporarily unavailable and imputed.” 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed as investor attention shifted to the Fed’s first projections on the economy post-coronavirus outbreak. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
RENTS INCREASE 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI slipped 0.1% in May after decreasing 0.4% in April, the largest drop since the series started in 1957. The so-called core CPI fell in March for the first time since January 2010. 
May marked the first time that the core CPI has dropped for three consecutive months. Underlying inflation was depressed by continued decreases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance and apparel. Airline fares fell 4.9% and used cars and trucks prices dropped 0.4%. 
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation dropped 1.8% last month after record 8.1% plunge in April. 
Those price declines offset a 0.3% increase in owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home. This rent measure gained 0.2% in April, likely reflecting forbearance agreements between landlords and tenants who have lost their jobs or have had their hours cut because of the global pandemic. 
The economy has shed nearly 20 million jobs since March. 
Healthcare costs increased 0.5% in May after a solid 0.4% rise in April. Consumers paid more for household furnishings, new vehicles, alcoholic beverages and education. 
In the 12 months through May, the core CPI rose 1.2%, the smallest gain since March 2011. The core CPI increased 1.4% year-on-year in April. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in April, the smallest advance since December 2010. May’s core PCE price index data will be released at the end of the month. 
“The weakness in the economy should keep downward pressure on inflation over time and we expect softness in the core measures to be reported for upcoming months,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “But we think that we probably have moved past the largest sequential monthly declines in inflation that came shortly after the virus spread.”

But the latest forecast here from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) also predicts that some 33,000 lives would be saved if at least 95% of Americans consistently wear face coverings in public. 
“People need to know that wearing masks can reduce transmission of the virus by as much as 50%, and those who refuse are putting their lives, their families, their friends and their communities at risk,” IHME’s director, Dr. Christopher Murray, said in a statement. 
The new IHME worst-case forecast - 179,106 U.S. lives lost by Oct. 1 - was revised downward from the 201,000 deaths projected on June 15. 
Several states have reported steadily rising case numbers over the past several weeks, “but deaths are not yet rising at the same rate, a trend which could change in the coming weeks,” the researchers said. 
At least 121,500 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, while reported U.S. infections have surpassed 2.37 million, according to a tally by Reuters. 
The revised IHME model, frequently cited by U.S. public health authorities, assumes a re-imposition of rigid social-distancing mandates in states where the daily mortality rates reach exceed eight deaths per 1 million people. 
So far only Texas and Florida, among the states that have been the most aggressive in reopening their economies, have reached this level of resurgence, the researchers said. 
Mask-wearing at current reported levels is included in the model, they said. 
 The projections are a range, with about 180,000 deaths the average between a best-case scenario of 159,497 lives lost and a worst-case scenario of 213,715 fatalities.

Australia has been generally successful in containing the new coronavirus, even if the populous southern state of Victoria on Friday experienced a 10th straight day of double-digit new infections. 
The relaxation of restrictions began in some parts of Australia in early May and the government has pledged to remove the bulk of them by the end of July, although each state and territory is determining its own pace. 
TA said data from its “Book a Court” online system showed a record 32,234 bookings made last month, with traffic doubling from a year earlier among venues that were using the system in May 2019. 
“During the pandemic, we are seeing more people enjoying the social, mental and physical benefits of (tennis) while maintaining strict physical distancing measures,” TA chief executive Craig Tiley said in a statement. 
“As restrictions in most of the country continue to ease over the coming months, we hope to build on these results as we approach our summer.” 
Professional tennis also returns to Australia this weekend with the A$450,000 ($311,000) UTR Pro Series getting underway under strict biosecurity protocols at closed venues in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.

Owners warned the sudden reversals, just weeks after accelerated reopenings, will drive some out of business. 
“You can’t turn a bar into an UberEats,” said Jeff Kaplan, co-owner of Houston’s Axelrad Beer Garden. He said businesses could not stay afloat relying on the new rules that provide to-go sales but not alcohol consumption on the premises. 
Houston officials advised residents to stay home, and Texas ordered doctors to end elective surgeries as new coronavirus cases set records on three consecutive days. Florida reported nearly 9,000 new infections on Friday, also a record high. 
Houston restaurant owner Peter Mitchell said his revenue has been running a third of normal and fell further as virus cases soared in the region. 
“It’ll be a close call as to whether we stay open,” he said. 
“I wish we had tougher restrictions for another month when we did the 25% occupancy (phase),” said Mitchell. He said his business never has exceeded 25% occupancy, but noted that no regulators have ever checked. 
Florida owners also complained that counties and cities in the state had inconsistent operating rules. 
“The level of ambiguity that we’ve run into every step of the way has been really challenging,” said Will Thompson, owner of Miami’s Jaguar Sun. “It comes back to the lack of clarity from officials.” 
Gabriel Orta, whose company runs hotel food and beverage operations in Miami, said rules are inconsistent. “We don’t have the leadership that we need when we go into a catastrophe,” he added. 
Anthony Wegmann, who ran four bars and restaurants in Texas, closed two after a landlord would not grant a reprieve on rent. “There’s no way a business can pay 100% of their bills on 25% of their revenue,” he said. 
Some are willing to accept the loss of business for the public good. “It was a little unexpected,” said Sara Murray, manager of the Cheers Pub in Friendswood, Texas. “In the end we all have to do what we have to do to keep everyone safe.

It was in the central Chinese city, the home of China’s first Grand Slam champion Li Na, that the novel coronavirus first emerged before spreading to the rest of the world, forcing the suspension of professional tennis in early March. 
Wuhan has accounted for the majority of China’s coronavirus deaths to date and the city was subject to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world for 76 days. 
“To go through that, to overcome that, I think it’s huge,” the tournament’s co-director Brenda Perry told Reuters from her home in Auckland. 
“It’s huge symbolism and I think very inspiring for everybody there. 
“At the moment that’s one of the first to experience the closest to being back to normal that we see around the world. It’s a very hopeful story for not just Wuhan but for China, for the world, of overcoming a huge challenge.” 
After a cluster of new cases of the virus in May sparked fears of a second spike, Wuhan tested 9.9 million people out of a population of 11 million. 
“I feel that Wuhan did some incredible job on recovery,” Perry said. 
“I don’t think we hear much about that. Not as much as the fact that COVID-19 started in Wuhan. And they have almost everything back to normal, whether it’s transport or restaurants or cinemas, people going back to work in the offices or their industries.” 
Perry said she had been in touch with the local organising team on a daily basis as they prepare to start the tournament on Oct. 19, pending government approval and confirmation that players will be able to travel. 
“I’ve never heard from Wuhan, ‘we can’t do this’,” she said, adding that a final call on the event was expected by early August. 
“In many ways Wuhan is fortunate that the tournament is toward the end of the calendar and it’s got the maximum time for recovery.” 
‘ZERO HESITATION’ 
There are many roadblocks still and Perry concedes that convincing players to sign up will be a tall order. 
The current top three in the rankings - Ash Barty, Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova - were in the 2019 field of the event. 
Perry appreciates that athletes will have health concerns but she hopes to use her background as a former professional and a player representative on the WTA board to help convince them to play. 
“It’s going to be very important that we communicate to the players,” she said. 
“(If it’s unsafe) I’ll be the first one to go ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be going there’. 
“I have zero hesitation right now about going to Wuhan ... I believe it’s one of the safest cities to go to anywhere in the world because it’s probably the most tested city in the world.” 
Because of the financial impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on sport, Wuhan, like all of the WTA’s Premier 5 events, will see a 32% cut in prize money. 
The Wuhan Open is currently committed to having no fans 13,500 of them turned out for the 2019 final and negotiations with sponsors are expected to be tricky. 
“It’s a very different conversation now and we are looking at trying to be innovative as to what we can offer,” Perry said. 
“One of the things could be being associated with such a positive comeback. I think that will hopefully be a story of interest for our sponsors to be associated with.”

Mohammad Hasnain, Shadab Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Hafeez and Wahab Riaz, however, must return a second negative result before they can join the main squad of 20 players who will leave for England on Sunday. 
“These players were asymptomatic, which means their chances of regaining complete fitness are higher and brighter than most,” PCB chief executive Wasim Khan said in a statement. 
“As soon as these players test negative twice through the PCB testing process they will be flown to England to join the squad.” 
Kashif Bhatti, Haris Rauf, Haider Ali and Imran Khan have tested positive again. 
Pakistan are scheduled to play three test matches and three T20 internationals behind closed doors in August-September, although the exact dates and venues have not been announced yet. 
After reaching Manchester on Sunday, the players will undergo COVID-19 tests before moving to Worcestershire for a 14-day isolation period, the PCB said. 
Test captain Azhar Ali and limited-overs skippers Babar Azam will be in the first batch of players, accompanied by head coach Misbah-ul-Haq. 
Fast bowling coach Waqar Younis will travel to England from Australia, while Twenty20 specialist Shoaib Malik has been allowed to join late after meeting his family in India. 
“With the test series being played first in August, Misbah is satisfied with the group of players that are travelling on Sunday as the focus will be on red-ball preparation,” the PCB CEO added. (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by Hugh Lawson)"

Health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara said while there was no target number for downloads, “we want to make as many people as possible to use this app”. 
Apps such as this may be able to halt an epidemic if usage reaches 60% of the population, according to an Oxford University study. 
Yuki Furuse, a professor at Kyoto University, said there’s debate about whether usage has to be that high to be effective, but “the more people use the app, the more it would be effective for the outbreak response.” 
Japan lifted a state of emergency in late May. It has weathered the epidemic better than most developed countries, with almost 18,000 infections and 969 deaths. 
The app, named COCOA for Contact-Confirming Application, was designed by Microsoft Corp and is available for Apple Inc’s iPhone and devices using Google’s Android software. 
It uses Bluetooth signals to detect contact with nearby users lasting 15 minutes or more. If a user later tests positive for the virus, their contacts can be traced and notified through the programme. 
Numerous countries have rolled out contact-tracing apps, including Australia, Malaysia, Britain, India, Germany and Italy. 
Singapore was among the first with its TraceTogether app launched in March, but privacy concerns hampered its uptake, prompting a switch to wearable devices. 
The new coronavirus, which was first detected in China in late 2019, has infected more than 9.62 million people globally and 488,467 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The footwear maker’s shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading. 
The wholesale business, through which Nike sells merchandise to other retailers, came to a halt amid the health crisis. That led to a 50% fall in shipments, increased inventory and higher costs due to order cancellations. 
As a result, gross margin fell 820 basis points in the fourth quarter, when company-owned stores and other retailers were closed for nearly eight weeks. 
However, Nike’s investments in its digital platform over the years helped it record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear and sneakers from the comfort of their homes. 
Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts the company is now accelerating focus on its online presence, and expects its overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. Online sales accounted for 30% of total revenue in the quarter. 
“COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound,” Donahoe said. 
In China, where the virus was first detected, all of Nike’s stores are now open. Revenue fell 3% in the Greater China region, while they plunged nearly 47% in North America. 
Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali said the Nike brand is still strong and China sales number is an indicator of what to expect in western markets and the United States as things normalize.

The government reallocated remdesivir to states with increasing cases, White House task force coordinator Deborah Birx said during a briefing on Friday. 
HHS said on its website that the doses will ship starting Monday and extinguish the full amount of Gilead’s donation of 120,647 treatment courses. It said it would continue to work with Gilead to determine how the company’s anticipated inventory of 2 million doses by year’s end will be allocated. 
California will receive 464 cases of 40 vials each, Texas will receive 448 cases of 40 vials, Florida will receive 360 cases of 40 vials and Arizona will receive 356 cases of 40 vials, according to the website. 
Gilead donated the courses after the treatment received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month. 
New York, which was one of the hardest hit states initially, was allocated 2,714 cases in total.

COVID-19 antibody tests not backed by solid data 
Studies assessing the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests had major shortcomings, an analysis released on Thursday found, indicating that existing research does not prove the tests can confirm with certainty whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus. Cochrane, a British-based journal that reviews research evidence, looked at 54 studies that sought to measure the reliability of the antibody blood tests. The studies were often small, did not use the most reliable methods, and their results were often incomplete, the analysis found. The analyzed studies looked at nearly 16,000 blood samples, 89% of which had a high risk of bias because patients were unlikely to match the general population. The review identified data from 25 commercial COVID-19 tests, a fraction of the roughly 300 such tests that exist. The review did not include tests offered by Roche or Abbott Laboratories, which were approved by regulators after the analysis began. (reut.rs/2CAXSf1; bit.ly/2YyTxlb) 
Pregnant women have greater risk for severe COVID-19 
Pregnant women face an increased risk of severe coronavirus infections, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released on Thursday showed. Pregnant women with COVID-19 are 50% more likely to need intensive care and 70% more likely to be put on mechanical ventilators than non-pregnant women, although pregnant women did not have a higher risk of death, CDC researchers reported in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black pregnant women appear to be disproportionately affected by the coronavirus infection during pregnancy, the study also found. Earlier in the pandemic, researchers in China and Britain reported no extra risk for pregnant women. But last month, a large study in Sweden found pregnant women infected with the virus were more than five times as likely to need intensive care and four times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation. The CDC study did not include data on how COVID-19 affects the outcomes of pregnancies. (reut.rs/38aqHe3; bit.ly/2CKVF0P) 
Coronavirus traces found in Spanish sewage from March 2019 
Spanish researchers have found traces of the novel coronavirus in Barcelona wastewater collected in March 2019, nine months before COVID-19 was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. University of Barcelona virologists led by Albert Bosch had been monitoring wastewater since April of this year. When they decided to test older samples, they said they found genetic material from the virus in one sample from March 12, 2019. The presence of the virus genome so early in Spain, if confirmed, would indicate the pathogen appeared much earlier than previously thought. In their not-yet-peer-reviewed paper posted on Friday on medRxiv, the researchers also said they found the virus in Barcelona wastewater from Jan. 15 of this year, 41 days before the first case was officially reported there. Joan Ramon Villalbi of the Spanish Society for Public Health and Sanitary Administration said it was still early to draw definitive conclusions based on these findings. ""When it's just one result, you always want more data, more studies, more samples to confirm it and rule out a laboratory error or a methodological problem,"" he said. (reut.rs/2Zb8sBb; bit.ly/382ZNot) 
Flu vaccine use in elderly may be linked to community coronavirus mortality 
COVID-19 death rates may be lower in communities where large proportions of elderly residents received flu vaccines, based on data from more than 2,000 counties around the United States. Researchers found that a 10% increase in vaccination coverage among people older than 65 was associated on average with a 28% decrease in the COVID-19 death rate in a given county. It is possible that social, economic and health factors contributed to lower coronavirus mortality in counties where more seniors got flu vaccines, the researchers said. Their findings were based on data reported by counties, not by individuals. Still, the researchers said, ""The significant public health implications of this possibility point to an urgent need for studying the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 mortality at the individual level, to investigate both the epidemiology and any underlying biological mechanism."" On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said flu vaccination during the pandemic is very important to reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and ease burdens on the healthcare system.

Bring sick kids for medical care during lockdown, doctors say 
With lockdown orders in place, parents may hesitate to take sick children to the doctor. But research by pediatricians in Britain concluded that if medical care is delayed - particularly when a child appears seriously ill - ""the unintended consequences of the lockdown will do more harm and claim more children's lives than COVID-19."" Among nearly 2,500 pediatricians surveyed for the study published on Thursday in Archives of Disease in Childhood, one in three said they had dealt with medical emergencies in children who probably would have sought medical care before becoming so ill were it not for the pandemic. Children with diabetes were most often involved, but also those with life threatening blood infections and cancer, survey responses indicated. (bit.ly/3i4CSNY)

It was in the central Chinese city, the home of China’s first Grand Slam champion Li Na, that the novel coronavirus first emerged before spreading to the rest of the world, forcing the suspension of professional tennis in early March. 
Wuhan has accounted for the majority of China’s coronavirus deaths to date and the city was subject to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world for 76 days. 
“To go through that, to overcome that, I think it’s huge,” the tournament’s co-director Brenda Perry told Reuters from her home in Auckland. 
“It’s huge symbolism and I think very inspiring for everybody there. 
“At the moment that’s one of the first to experience the closest to being back to normal that we see around the world. It’s a very hopeful story for not just Wuhan but for China, for the world, of overcoming a huge challenge.” 
After a cluster of new cases of the virus in May sparked fears of a second spike, Wuhan tested 9.9 million people out of a population of 11 million. 
“I feel that Wuhan did some incredible job on recovery,” Perry said. 
“I don’t think we hear much about that. Not as much as the fact that COVID-19 started in Wuhan. And they have almost everything back to normal, whether it’s transport or restaurants or cinemas, people going back to work in the offices or their industries.” 
Perry said she had been in touch with the local organising team on a daily basis as they prepare to start the tournament on Oct. 19, pending government approval and confirmation that players will be able to travel. 
“I’ve never heard from Wuhan, ‘we can’t do this’,” she said, adding that a final call on the event was expected by early August. 
“In many ways Wuhan is fortunate that the tournament is towards the end of the calendar and it’s got the maximum time for recovery.” 
‘ZERO HESITATION’ 
There are many roadblocks still and Perry concedes that convincing players to sign up will be a tall order. 
The current top three in the rankings - Ash Barty, Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova - were in the 2019 field of the event. 
Perry appreciates that athletes will have health concerns but she hopes to use her background as a former professional and a player representative on the WTA board to help convince them to play. 
“It’s going to be very important that we communicate to the players,” she said. 
“(If it’s unsafe) I’ll be the first one to go ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be going there’. 
“I have zero hesitation right now about going to Wuhan ... I believe it’s one of the safest cities to go to anywhere in the world because it’s probably the most tested city in the world.” 
Because of the financial impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on sport, Wuhan, like all of the WTA’s Premier 5 events, will see a 32% cut in prize money. 
The Wuhan Open is currently committed to having no fans 13,500 of them turned out for the 2019 final and negotiations with sponsors are expected to be tricky. 
“It’s a very different conversation now and we are looking at trying to be innovative as to what we can offer,” Perry said. 
“One of the things could be being associated with such a positive comeback. I think that will hopefully be a story of interest for our sponsors to be associated with.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Nick Mulvenney and Toby Davis)"

Airbnb has a degree of cushioning. It scrambled to raise capital once the pandemic hit, including $2 billion in debt. All the same, it’s easy to see why the company would cut jobs to such a severe degree. While lockdowns are beginning to lift, it could be a long time until travel resumes in earnest, let alone until enough travellers are comfortable that Airbnb sees pre-pandemic booking levels. The layoffs might help Airbnb survive until that point without having to ask for more money."

If 1,000 people use the system, 100 people may still get inaccurate results. So while this shows promise and it could indicate the kinds of solutions we’ll have in the future, it may take some time before something like this is ready for real-world use.
“We feel this platform will be integral to protecting our healthcare workers, first responders and communities as we adjust to life in the COVID-19 era,” said Ali Rezai, RNI executive chair.
The platform is currently being tested by more than 600 healthcare professionals and first responders, and RNI is working with partners like Thomas Jefferson University and Vanderbilt University to scale the test to include more than 10,000 participants. 
The study isn’t the only attempt to use the rings to predict COVID-19 infections. Researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) are also exploring how Oura Ring might be used to detect the virus in emergency medical workers.
“We are hopeful that Oura’s technology will advance how people identify and understand our body’s most nuanced physiological signals and warning signs, as they relate to infectious diseases like COVID-19,” Oura Health CEO Harpreet Rai said in a statement."

While critics say the centralized approach raises privacy concerns, NHSX CEO Matthew Gould told Reuters that the group “put privacy right at the heart” of the app. He explained that the app doesn’t know who users are, where they are or who they’ve been near. Britain’s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham pointed out that the centralized approach will allow the UK to gather more insights into the virus, something a decentralized approach might limit.

The company saw slumps in hardware sales almost across the board, but it reported a total of $58.3 billion in revenue -- just edging out its performance this time last year.
“Despite COVID-19’s unprecedented global impact, we’re proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter,” CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. 
Today’s results didn’t come out of the blue. Earlier this year, Apple confirmed to its shareholders that it would not meet its previous revenue guidance of between $63 billion and $67 billion because of a “slower return to normal conditions” than the company had anticipated. Cook noted today that, before the coronavirus had begun to reach massive proportions, Apple was expecting a highly successful quarter with revenue near the top of its guidance.
In this past quarter, Apple has continued with its work as best as possible and pushed forward with new product releases, including updated versions of the iPad Pro and MacBook Air. Those devices were released too late to have a significant impact on these results, though. Despite raking in $4.37 billion from its iPad business and $5.35 billion off Mac sales, the company still fell short of the watermark it set this time last year. Since it accounts for the majority of Apple's business, it's little surprise Apple's iPhone business took the brunt of the damage -- sales fell from $31 billion in the year-ago quarter to $28.9 billion this time. Apple didn't elaborate on the cause of this dramatic dip in its initial release, but soft sales in China and coronavirus-related production delays likely contributed to the situation. 
Despite these sales slumps, Apple did report a few successes in this quarter. The company's services business -- which has quickly become one of Apple's most crucial growth areas -- made all-time high $13.3 billion. Sales in Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories category surged slightly, too, generating $6.3 billion for the company. 
For now at least, Apple seems to be holding everything together quite well, but there's one important thing to remember: This is the last quarter on the books that wasn't completely influenced by the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. (Apple's Q2 started at the beginning of January 2020, before the coronavirus situation began to spiral.) As a result, the big changes we've all had to grapple with will be more fully reflected in the company's next earnings release. For instance, Apple closed all of its stores outside Greater China on March 13th, two weeks before the end of Q2. The effects of that decision will likely have a huge impact on Apple's next batch of financials, as will the new iPhone SE, which seems well-positioned to help Apple gain ground with value-minded consumers. For now, we'll have to see how things play out; Apple will certainly face questions about the future of its supply chains, production capability and new hardware development during its customary earnings call, and we’ll update this story with any notable tidbits."

Now, the banner has been expanded to the “COVID-19 business updates section,” allowing businesses to share significantly more information. A business can post any updates to service, such as if it’s offering dine-in service, curbside pickup, or both. Businesses can also use the banner to inform customers of any safety measures they’re enacting, such as “enforcing social distancing, sanitizing between customers, mandating staff wear masks and/or gloves, providing hand sanitizer or contactless payment, and more.”"

The firm reviews camera footage, checks where people were present and conducts interviews, according to a spokesperson. It also insisted that it immediately alerts all workers if there’s a positive case, and that it was up to employees to disclose if they tested positive.
Critics have already contended that Amazon’s approach isn’t enough, though, and doesn’t meet CDC guidelines despite claims to the contrary. Warehouse footage only covers 24 hours (not the 48 hours needed for CDC tracing) and likely doesn’t include high-contact areas like washrooms. It would also break CDC guidelines if it discouraged staff from revealing positive test results.

As in other countries, the app is meant to complement conventional contract tracing efforts wherein medical professionals reach out to people who may have come in contact with a COVID-19 patient. The software uses Bluetooth LE to record when the user passes someone else who has the app installed on their phone. It also notes how long they've been near one another. Should a user of the app test positive for COVID-19, it will inform anyone they've been in contact with for longer than 15 minutes. Governments worldwide see smartphone contract tracing apps as an essential tool in stopping a potential second wave of COVID-19 cases, but they need widespread adoption to be useful. 
Besides low adoption, other issues may hamper the effectiveness of the app. Not all of Germany's clinics can transmit test results electronically. In those instances, people who test positive for COVID-19 will need to phone a national hotline to sync their apps properly. There's a worry some people may call the hotline to troll people who have the app installed on their phone. At launch, the software also isn't compatible with the contract tracing apps other European governments have deployed in their countries; roaming functionality is something Germany plans to add some time in the next few weeks. 
Still, a lot is riding on the success of the app. According to tracking by Johns Hopkins University, the country has had 188,213 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,814 deaths to date, meaning it has had both fewer cases and deaths than Italy and the UK. But with the government easing travel restrictions and events like IFA coming up, there's a chance for the coronavirus to flare up again."

 (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be following some of the central pages of President Donald Trump's playbook. And the results seem to be heading in an even more catastrophic direction. 
In the past seven days, the World Health Organization reports that Russia has added over 75,000 coronavirus cases, more than double the nearest European nation, the United Kingdom. Even more troubling: The growth rate of the disease was 56%. Moscow has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the country, with only scattered clusters in other major cities like St. Petersburg, and as far as some oil and gas fields in the more remote reaches of Siberia.
In Moscow, the mayor himself has conceded that numbers may be vastly under-counted. Last week, in an interview on Russia 24 television, Sergey Sobyanin said he believes the real Covid-19 count in his city was around 300,000, or more than triple the official government count of 92,676. A new Financial Times study even estimates that death toll may be higher than the official count by as much as 70%. And indeed, residents are largely taking to heart the government's warning to social distance and stay at home. 
""Sometimes I'll be walking around and it seems like it's the middle of the night and somebody just turned the lights on,"" David Grout, a translator, musician, and longtime American resident of Moscow said in a Zoom interview, describing how empty the usually crowded streets are these days. Use of masks is frequent, he said, adding that the city's center ""has its own sort of rules.""
Indeed, in St. Petersburg, Susan Katz, a longtime American citizen married to a Russian, told me that she estimates barely 10% of people on the streets wear masks. Starting on Tuesday, she said, masks will be required in St. Petersburg. There is officially a ban on people going to parks, but only some have yellow tape around them, and the weather has been idyllic as spring began arriving. She has seen few police on the streets enforcing any regulations. 
Which suggests the first page in Putin's playbook. The president is clearly stepping back from what rapidly seems to be turning into the greatest single challenge to his presidency, placing administration of the crisis in the hands of governors and mayors, most of whom owe their job to him in any event. 
Putin himself has largely disappeared from public view, confining his appearances to an occasional broadcast from a windowless room in his residence against a drab backdrop. In part, Putin's seclusion may be attributed to the fact that his minister of construction Vladimir Yakushev, culture minister Olga Lyubimova, and prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, all have come down with the coronavirus. 
On Saturday, Putin who loves vast displays of power and ceremony, told his people they were ""invincible."" These words were meant to have been spoken at a very different venue--the lavish May 9 celebration of Victory Day, the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II that was to have featured a parade through Red Square with Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping at his side. Canceled. Earlier, a nationwide referendum for a constitutional change that would effectively have bestowed on him presidency for life was postponed indefinitely. And, perhaps most troubling, his approval rating has plunged to 59% -- the lowest in 20 years, according to the independent Levada Center.
While officially, the government is doing all the right things to stem the vast economic impact of the coronavirus, these measures are not taking hold on large stretches of the population that are most seriously impacted. ""Putin not only doesn't control the situation, but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,"" Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British think tank Chatham House told The Guardian newspaper. ""He cannot adjust ... I think partly Putin's lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position."" 
The government has, nominally, taken the right measures. At the end of January, Russia closed its land borders with China, the entry of all foreign nationals was banned on March 18, and on March 30 it closed all borders with the outside world. On April 16, Putin introduced an economic stimulus plan to provide aid businesses in the form of interest free loans and employee payments, adding to an announcement from Mistushin a month earlier of a 300 billion rubles stimulus (about $4 billion). On April 1, the Prime Minister also revealed 1.4 trillion rubles (barely $19 billion) in total economic aid. The fact is that plunging oil prices and western sanctions have been wreaking havoc on the Russian economy even as Covid-19 began arriving.
But this help has not filtered down to many economic sectors, leading to potentially catastrophic results. Grout said local websites have reported cases of people being mugged on the street for groceries. Still, the shops are full and there are no real shortages. The question is how long people, out of work and sheltering, will be able to afford shopping.
""Russia has experienced a delayed beginning to the epidemic and is now seeing that increase in cases,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme told me. ""Russia has also increased its testing both in the urban areas and outside and the increased numbers may reflect partly that, but there's also been an increase in deaths which means the disease is clearly having an impact."" Then he added that Russia ""can learn some of the lessons that have been learned at great cost in Asia, in North America and in Western Europe."" 
The big question is whether Putin can learn and, more importantly, apply these lessons. He's already talked three times with Xi Jinping, leader of China where only the most draconian measures resulted in a dramatic turnaround in that nation's Covid-19 spread. Moreover, is Putin in any sense prepared to take such measures in a country where he clearly has little of Xi's ability simply to crack down on a people who may already be becoming restless. 
Last week, in a telephone call, Trump promised Putin to deliver a supply of ventilators, observing that Russia has had a ""hard time"" with the disease
On Monday, in a nationwide address, Putin took another page out of Trump's playbook and, though cases are continuing to mount nationwide at more than double the pace of any other nation in Europe, said that beginning on Tuesday, ""the national period of non-working days will be over for all sectors of the economy."" Still, he said regions or municipalities could keep the regulations in place if necessary. 
The fact is that both leaders could learn quite a lot from each other as the disease progresses through its various, pernicious stages. What is equally clear from both is that a hands-off approach or ducking reality and the accompanying hard choices can only lead to catastrophic results -- medically and politically."

The agreement comes after a protracted period of negotiation among the various constituencies -- including actors, directors and crews -- and relies on extensive testing, temperature checks, cleaning measures and physical distancing when possible. The parties also acknowledge that revisions might be necessary going forward.
Certain activities, such as writing and casting, are still encouraged to be conducted virtually whenever possible. At the same time, other parts of production -- including live studio audiences -- are being discouraged, and must be conducted with restrictions like social-distancing measures when used.
Actors and other performers, it's noted, are ""most vulnerable because they cannot wear PPE when cameras are rolling, and frequently will not be able to engage in physical distancing."" That will require greater testing frequency for them and those with whom they are in close contact.
There are some activities, such as makeup and fight scenes, where stronger safeguards aren't possible, the report acknowledges.
The plans have been submitted to officials in New York and California. But movie and TV production takes place all over the world, including Europe Canada and New Zealand, where work on the next ""Avatar"" movies is already scheduled to resume after a quarantine period.
The guidelines rely on the ability to respond appropriately if personnel contract the virus, and educating those on movie and TV sets, with a designated compliance officer. Efforts will also be made to ""assess health/wellness of all personnel prior to entry onto set.""
There are still plenty of questions regarding how all this will work practically, and significantly, how much it's going to cost. As Variety noted, the report's initial draft didn't specifically address how the expense of ""conducting extensive testing, cleaning and safety monitoring will be covered, and who will pay for it.""
The guidelines specify that personal protective equipment be worn, and provided ""to all cast and crew at no cost.""
The plan was produced by the Industry-Wide Labor Management Safety Committee Task Force, which was formed specifically for that purpose, with input from epidemiologists and sanitation experts."

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book ""Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos."" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable event on Monday: ""I'm taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah. Couple of weeks ago, I started taking it. Cause I think it's good, I've heard a lot of good stories.""
This admission about his use of hydroxychloroquine makes Trump's previous musings about using disinfectant to treat the coronavirus look sage. The President can call on the best scientists and doctors in the world for medical advice, and he comes up with this? Trump's own FDA in late April warned of the dangers of taking hydroxychloroquine outside of a hospital or a clinical study setting ""due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" 
Even Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto warned his viewers not to follow the President's example, saying, ""If you are in a risky population here, and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you."" (Trump swiftly slapped Cavuto down on Twitter.)
The President has made any number of other non-scientific claims about the coronavirus, including that warm weather will take care of the virus (don't count on it, says his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), or that the US had coronavirus ""totally under control,"" (see today's death toll of more than 91,000) or that we are ""very close to a vaccine"" (not likely, medical scientists say).
It's Trump's disregard for science that prompted the leading medical journal The Lancet to publish an unusual editorial over the weekend saying that ""Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics."" 
But he is not the only Trump to play fast and loose with the reality of this contagion: The apple falleth not far from the tree. A day before his father's stunning hydroxychloroquine admission, Eric Trump told Fox News that Democrats are milking the pandemic for political gain and trying to prevent his father from holding campaign rallies. And he predicted that after the presidential election on November 3 the ""coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen."" 
In fact, as the number of dead inches, day by day, toward 100,000, there is widespread agreement among scientists, including Trump's CDC Director, Robert Redfield, that a second wave of the pandemic will likely hit the US later this year. Redfield explained last month, ""There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through...We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time."" 
Not to be outdone, Donald Trump Jr. recently defended remarks he'd made on air before Fox News' large audience in February, when he suggested that ""for Democrats to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness."" He told Axios earlier this month that he was ""entitled to speak with such hyperbole."" 
Meanwhile, a week ago presidential son-in-law, senior adviser and savior of worlds Jared Kushner mused to a Time reporter that he couldn't ""commit one way or the other"" about the possibility of postponing the presidential election (neither he nor the President are legally empowered to do this). 
And at the end of April, Kushner touted to Fox News the ""great success"" of the Trump administration in fighting the coronavirus. Kushner told the network that he hopes the US will be ""really rocking again"" by July. The official death toll for Americans is already the worst in the world. A month and a half out, we're not rocking.
Jared's wife Ivanka, another senior adviser to the President, who is her father, also took one for the team by disregarding federal guidelines on not taking discretionary travel during the pandemic when she traveled from DC to her family golf club in New Jersey in mid-April.
First Lady Melania Trump? She has been strangely absent throughout this crisis despite her ""Be Best"" campaign that is focused on the well-being of American children -- and at a time when many children are living through what might be the most difficult experience of their lives.
Trump has cast the battle with coronavirus as a war and ordinary Americans as ""warriors."" But if the President is the general, he is leading his troops into battle armed with misinformation. Presumably, he is trying to control the narrative as he charges on toward the election -- and by doing so he appears more concerned with winning the election battle rather than beating the coronavirus. 
What an unbearable sadness for Americans to have such incompetence at the helm during the worst crisis in eight decades."

Instacart will expand its COVID-19 sick pay to include more gig workers as part of an agreement with the attorney general for Washington, DC. Under the agreement, the company is also launching a telemedicine pilot in the DC area to remotely diagnose shoppers who believe they may have contracted the disease, and provide childcare assistance pay to eligible workers while schools are closed.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing
In March, Instacart announced that employees who were quarantined or tested positive for COVID-19 would receive 14 days of sick pay, meant to encourage them to stay home rather than spreading the disease further. But getting that pay has proven difficult for shoppers who have often been blocked from the benefit either by the unavailability of tests or confusion around which agencies are authorized to recommend quarantine.
In May, a Verge investigation found that Instacarts sick pay was difficult to access in practice, with little clear logic as to when claims were granted or denied. Out of eight shoppers who spoke to us, only three successfully received the benefit, often because of unique efforts on their part. 
Under the new policy, anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 by their health care provider would be eligible for sick pay even if they have not received a positive test. Instacart will also allow shoppers to actively seek a diagnosis through a new telemedicine system, administered through Doctor on Demand. Instacart also pledged to provide sick pay to shoppers who live in the same residence as someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, seeing them as particularly at risk of contracting the disease.
The new policy will still require documentation whether of a quarantine order or a positive diagnosis and the agreement does not contain any provisions for improving how the company processes those requests. Still, DC Attorney General Ken Racine said the new measures were vital to preventing further spread of the ongoing pandemic.
We thank Instacart for doing the right thing, said Racine. During this pandemic, grocery delivery workers are risking their health to connect District residents to essential goods. Instacarts new policy will ensure that workers who are sick can stay home and seek care, and it helps protect their colleagues, consumers, and the public during this crisis. 
While the agreement was obtained through legal channels, theres been no allegation that Instacart acted illegally, and the agreement does not contain any admission of wrongdoing.
Instacart president Nilam Ganenthiran put the agreement in sunnier terms. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our team has been singularly focused on supporting the health and safety of our shopper community, he said in a statement. Were proud to partner with Attorney General Racine to expand our offerings and continue supporting our valued shopper community."

[extreme Stefon voice]: This story has everything: A high-speed super-yacht, a secret disaster strike force, a Google co-founder, and strawberry ice cream. 
The Daily Beasts Mark Harris has a wild story about Global Support and Development (GSD), a disaster charity founded by Sergey Brin thats being run by his former bodyguards. The story opens detailing how GSD provided disaster relief in the form of medical care and road-clearing crews after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas last year.
For the past five years, GSD has been quietly using high-tech systems to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance during high-profile disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These range from drones and super-yachts to a gigantic new airship that the outfit apparently hopes will make it easier to get aid supplies into disaster zones. 
And just as Google famously treatsor, pre-COVID-19 lockdown, treatedemployees to catered lunches, free gyms, and on-site massages, some of GSDs humanitarian workers have enjoyed strawberry ice cream and freshly laundered clothes on board Brins super-yacht during disaster deployments. 
The organization got its start in 2015 after Cyclone Pam pounded Vanuatu. Brins $80 million yacht, the Dragonfly, was sailing nearby with a doctor and paramedics on board, and the crew decided to spring into action. 
Making landfall at remote islands north of Vanuatus capital Port Vila, the Dragonflys team reportedly moved 62 metric tons of fresh water ashore, treated over 250 patients, facilitated three medical evacuations, and built shelters in multiple villages. 
The Daily Beast notes Brins philanthropy is similar to other attempted acts of benevolence from Silicon Valley billionaires (see: Musk, Elon and Gates, Bill) seeking to make a big impact. GSD even says its been involved with COVID-19 relief efforts, setting up drive-thru testing centers in California and provided supplies to eight US states. 
About half of the people working for GSD have military backgrounds. And not everyone is thrilled with the idea of a disaster rescue force made up of former military personnel, however well-meaning it may be: 
...[T]he use of ex-military personnel for humanitarian and conservation work is also controversial, according to Rosaleen Duffy, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Sheffield. They can arrive in complex situations with little understanding of the local context. They bring with them modes of thinking and acting, such as seeing certain groups of people as the enemy to battle against.
Whatever Brins motivation, this is a captivating story with great details about a billionaires mostly low-profile ventures into philanthropy, and his fascination with airships. Strongly recommend making time to check out the full story at The Daily Beast."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every facet of our lives, so it’s only natural that it would impact more than one of Apple’s product announcements at yesterday’s WWDC. Whether it’s the Apple Watch’s handwashing feature or the new face mask options for Memoji, the pandemic’s presence was repeatedly felt during Apple’s presentation. And let’s not forget, its entire prerecorded streaming format was driven by the pandemic in the first place.
In some cases, Apple’s announcements seemed to come in direct response to the pandemic, but others, like bicycle directions for Maps, were almost certainly in development prior to COVID-19. They just happen to be releasing at a time they’re needed most.
Apple has already made at least one change in response to the pandemic. Last month, with iOS 13.5, the company made it easier to unlock your Face ID-equipped phone if you’re wearing a mask. This is also the same iOS update that included support for Apple’s and Google’s contact-tracing API. 
Here are the biggest ways the COVID-19 pandemic was on display at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference:

 watchOS 7 can sense when you’re washing your hands and remind you to keep washing if you stop early.

 
The Apple Watch’s handwashing feature (obviously)
Let’s start with the obvious one: the Apple Watch is being updated to encourage you to wash your hands properly. We’ve seen similar features added to Samsung and Wear OS smartwatches, but Apple is claiming that its Watch is the first to automatically detect when you’re washing your hands. 
It does this by analyzing your hand motion using machine learning and listening to confirm the sound of running water. Then, it’ll display a countdown timer and alert you when you’ve washed your hands for the recommended amount of time. If you try to stop early, it’ll prompt you to carry on.

 Face coverings are just one of the new Memoji options.

 
Memoji face coverings
As COVID-19 spread around the world, face masks quickly emerged as a simple yet effective way of reducing transmission. Now, as countries are reckoning with how to allow businesses to open up post COVID-19, many are requiring people to wear face masks. They’re now required on many domestic flights in the US as well as in some theater chains. 
So it makes sense that Apple would add them as a Memoji customization option. During its WWDC presentation, the company showed off a Memoji wearing a green medical face mask, a color you can customize, according to the release notes for iOS 14.

 Cycling directions in Apple Maps give you information about how busy a route is.

 
Apple Maps cycling directions
Cycling directions aren’t something you build at the last minute, but they’ve been missing from Apple Maps for so long (Google Maps added them in 2010) that it’s still a wonderful coincidence they’d launch during the pandemic, just as interest in cycling is booming. Social distancing rules are difficult to maintain on public transport, so cycling is being promoted by cities as a healthier, more environmentally friendly alternative for getting around. The amount of time Apple spent on the feature during its presentation shows how important cycling has suddenly become.
With iOS 14, Apple Maps is getting updated with cycling directions for New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai, and Beijing. You’ll see elevation changes along your route, and the app can suggest times when you might be better off walking your bike up and down some stairs rather than cycling the long way round. A screenshot of the functionality shown by Apple shows that the app can give you a choice between faster and less busy routes.

 App Clips were advertised as a quicker way to rent shared e-scooters, among other things.

 
App Clips for micromobility sharing and more
Micromobility sharing services are another way to avoid public transport, and with iOS 14, Apple has introduced a feature that should make it easier to rent shared vehicles like e-scooters regardless of what brand you stumble upon. App Clips are a means of getting a small portion of an app onto your phone in seconds without having to go through the normal process of downloading it from the App Store. At WWDC, Apple specifically demoed it being used to unlock and rent an e-scooter.
App Clips are a big feature that Apple envisions being used for everything from paying for parking to ordering coffee in a shop without having to interact closely with other humans. It looks like a feature that Apple was going to introduce regardless of the pandemic, especially after Google’s Instant Apps for Android launched in 2017. But as companies like Starbucks turn to mobile ordering systems to help with social distancing and contactless payments, App Clips could help with many more aspects of our post-coronavirus lives.

 Messages is getting updated with better support for groups.

 
Messages and FaceTime improvements
It’s no secret that the pandemic has made messaging and video communications apps more important than ever, and we’ve already seen multiple companies introduce new features in response. WhatsApp and Google Duo have increased the maximum number of participants you can have in a call, Google has made its Meet videoconferencing service free for anyone with a Google account, and Zoom has become a household name. 
In a similar vein, Apple’s services are receiving a series of updates that should make them more effective communication tools, which will be especially helpful during the pandemic. Messages, for example, is getting better support for group chats in iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur. You’ll be able to respond to specific messages in a chat and call people out by name — two features that are critical for facilitating communications with large groups. iOS 14’s new picture-in-picture options will also make it easier to multitask while on FaceTime calls. While on a call, if you swipe up to go to your home screen, the call will minimize to a small picture-in-picture mode and continue playing, even when you open another app.

 Tim Cook took to the stage in an empty auditorium to begin yesterday’s presentation.

 
The presentation as a whole
Of course, the online-only format of the presentation was probably the single biggest way the pandemic was on display at WWDC. Rather than opting for an onstage demonstration in the style that the company has been using for decades, COVID-19 forced Apple to reinvent its approach, with individual presenters describing and demonstrating its software across various locations.
At the end of the presentation, Apple took a moment to detail its commitment to health and safety during filming. Face coverings were worn by everyone on set aside from the on-camera presenter, social distancing measures were observed, and Apple says that when multiple presenters were featured, they were isolated from one another.
It was a refreshing change for a company that’s used the same approach for its demonstrations for years, dating back to the time of its late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. To me, it felt like a change for the better. The whole presentation was slick and densely packed with information, even if a little atmosphere may have been lost due to the lack of a live audience. 
It was a refreshing change of pace, and I’d like to see at least parts of this style stick around even when it’s safe for Apple to do public presentations again."

The AstraZeneca vaccine is considered the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development to obtain licensure and become an official vaccine against the disease, according to the World Health Organization. 
The British drugmaker is already carrying out large-scale, mid-stage human trials of the vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Oxford University. 
Elcio Franco, Brazil’s No.2 public health official, said in a press conference that the country will initially produce some 30 million doses of the vaccine, half by December and half by January of next year. 
Franco said Brazil is paying for the vaccine but is aware of the risk, in case the vaccine does not pass all necessary licensure requirements or another vaccine obtains approval faster. 
The vaccine will be produced by Brazil’s Fundação Osvaldo Cruz, also known as Fiocruz, the country’s leading public health organization, Franco said. 
Brazil is the world’s second most affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 1.2 million confirmed cases as of Friday and more than 55,000 deaths. 
Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for this response to the pandemic. He has dismissed the severity of the disease and has shown indifference to the rising death toll while also pushing treatment using an unproven anti-malaria drug.

The PGA Tour said in a statement that Day, who was originally slated to play as part of a threesome, would tee off alone from the 10th hole as a precautionary measure. 
Day, who has competed in all three PGA Tour events since the tour’s resumption following a three-month break due to the pandemic, missed the cut at the Charles Schwab Challenge and RBC Heritage. 
The Australian, who opened with rounds of 67 and 69, was at four-under-par overall after 36 rounds, nine shots behind leader Phil Mickelson. 
Nick Watney last week became the first Tour player to test positive, and Cameron Champ did so at a pre-tournament screening this week. 
World number four Brooks Koepka and Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell withdrew from the Travelers as a precaution after their caddies tested positive. The two golfers tested negative. 
World number five Webb Simpson opted out after a family member tested positive, while Koepka’s brother Chase withdrew as he played a practice round with Brooks and McDowell. 
Denny McCarthy, the third golfer on the Tour to return a positive test, withdrew on Friday, while Bud Cauley, who played alongside McCarthy in the opening round, dropped out as a precautionary measure. 
“All follow-up tests as a result of potential contact with McCarthy were negative,” the PGA Tour added.

Florida on Saturday morning reported 9,585 new infections in the last 24 hours, a record for a second day, while Arizona recorded 3,591 new cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, matching its prior record on June 23. 
The United States recorded more than 45,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the largest single-day increase of the pandemic, according to a Reuters tally. More than 2.5 million Americans now have tested positive. 
The surge in cases has been most pronounced in southern and western states like Florida and Texas, which are now taking steps to reinstate restrictions on businesses, threatening a hoped-for economic recovery and jobs. 
The mayor of Galena Park, a community of 10,000 people east of Houston, said she was heeding a warning from Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who on Friday raised the public threat level to its most severe, a sign people should shelter at home. 
“It is crucial to continue to practice good hygiene, stay home as much as possible, avoid unnecessary trips, gatherings, and wear a face-covering at all times when you leave your home,” Mayor Esmeralda Moya said in a statement late on Friday. 
Galena Park’s curfew will run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily. 
In a reversal of his early moves to relax restrictions, Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday ordered bars across the state to close and required restaurants to limit indoor seating capacity to 50%. Florida, another state that reopened its economy relatively quickly, told bar owners in the state to immediately stop serving alcohol on their premises. 
Earlier this week New York joined New Jersey and Connecticut in imposing a 14-day mandatory quarantines on travelers from states with high infection rates.

United withdrew their annual financial targets in May after losing about 23 million pounds ($28 million) in quarterly revenue due to the season being temporarily suspended because of the coronavirus crisis. 
The Premier League restarted this month but fans have been barred from attending games, and Solskjaer said United, who also have 429 million pounds in debt, would adopt a cautious approach to spending. 
“We’ll have to take a big look at things ourselves to see how hard we’ve been hit,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final match at Norwich City. 
“It’s not for me to say we are going to have X amount because I don’t really know. We are a financially strong club, but we are also probably being hit more than anybody else.” 
United are fifth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, with seven games left to play. 
With second-placed Manchester City facing a European ban for breaching UEFA financial rules, fifth place should guarantee qualification for the lucrative Champions League, unless City win an appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 
City will discover the fate of their appeal next month, while United could also qualify for Europe’s elite club competition by winning the Europa League this season. 
“Let’s see how quickly we can get our fans back into the stadium,” Solskjaer added. 
“There’s still a lot of uncertainty and these three or four months, every businessman in the world, every footballer in the world, I think everyone is still unsure what the effect will be.”

There has been speculation that IAG, which also owns British Airways, could look to walk away from the acquisition of Spanish carrier Air Europa, announced last November, or try to negotiate a lower price. 
Luis Gallego, CEO of Iberia and due to take over as IAG chairman in September, said in an interview with El Pais newspaper published on Sunday that the deal still made sense but the environment was much more difficult. 
“We continue to see the strategic value (of the acquisition). The problem is that we are in a moment of crisis in the aeronautical industry,” Gallego said.

In February and March, a massive outbreak among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus made South Korea the scene of the first large outbreak outside of China. 
At least 5,213 of the country’s total 12,484 cases have been linked to the church outbreak, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). 
Church founder Lee Man-hee had internally advised recovered members to donate their plasma, which is badly needed for coronavirus research, Shincheonji media coordinator Kim Young-eun told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Many of recovered church members wanted to donate to express thanks to the government and medical staff, she said. 
The city of Daegu - where most of the church infections were centred - filed a civil lawsuit against the church on Monday, seeking 100 billion won ($82.75 million) in damages. 
Daegu authorities had previously filed a complaint against the church accusing it of not submitting a full list of members and facilities, and not cooperating with city health efforts. 
Shincheonji says it fully complied with government efforts. 
The National Institute of Health said 185 people have so far come forward to donate plasma as of Monday and said they were in talks with Shincheonji for donations. 
South Korea health officials have said that in the absence of other treatments or vaccines, plasma therapy may be a way to lower the death rate, especially in critical patients. 
At least 17 South Koreans have received the experimental therapy, which involves using plasma from recovered patients with antibodies to the virus, enabling the body to defend against the disease. 
South Korea has reported 281 deaths from COVID-19. 
Health authorities said they were testing 176 people who came into contact with crew members on a Russian fishing vessel docked at Busan after 16 aboard the vessel were tested positive.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 (Reuters) - Malaysian palm oil futures bounced back on Tuesday as crude prices rose, but gains were limited by fears that the surge in demand and exports would eventually lose steam if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections. 
The benchmark palm oil contract for September delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange settled up 21 ringgit, or 0.85%, at 2,466 ringgit ($577.38) a tonne, after falling as much as 1% earlier in the day. 
Crude oil prices rose after a volatile session sparked by confusion over the status of the U.S.-China trade deal. Stronger crude futures make palm a more attractive option for biodiesel feedstock. 
Earlier, markets were spooked by surprise comments from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro that a hard-won U.S-China trade deal was “over”, although U.S. President Donald Trump later assured that the pact was intact. 
Malaysia’s palm oil exports for June 1-20 jumped between 55.3% and 57% from a month earlier, according to data from cargo surveyors, after the easing of coronavirus curbs and an export duty exemption. 
However, the market lacks follow-up buying from destinations such as China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Europe to sustain the exceptionally strong exports, said Anilkumar Bagani, research head of Mumbai-based vegetable oil broker Sunvin Group. 
The Malaysian Palm Oil Council on Monday said exports were likely to increase further in the second half of the year, but a leading analyst cautioned that global consumption of the edible oil would fall for the first time on record. 
Dalian’s most-active soyoil contract fell 0.62%, while its palm oil contract was down 1.01%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade dropped 0.34%. 
Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market. ($1 = 4.2710 ringgit)

“The organisation of the Belgrade leg was catastrophic, the stands were so full that fans were virtually sitting on top of each other. He staged this event with the best of intentions but it turns out it was a big mistake.” 
While the players hugged at the net, played basketball, posed for pictures and attended news conferences together, Djokovic also organised nights out in Belgrade and pictures and videos of him dancing with the players made it to social media. 
The players, however, did not break any government protocols in Serbia or Croatia with both countries easing lockdown measures weeks before the event. 
But it highlighted the risks of athletes from different countries being in close proximity to one another, which could be a concern for the men’s ATP and women’s WTA Tour when they resume the professional circuit in August after five months. 
The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has also announced plans for the U.S. Open Grand Slam to be held as scheduled from Aug. 31 in New York and governing bodies are expected to have strict protocols is place. 
“We have to be careful because we also have to be conscious that even with extreme measures, you could actually end up having some players testing positive,” ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi told the New York Times. 
BUBBLE 
During the U.S. Open, players and guests must wear masks when onsite unless practising or competing and testing will be conducted before travelling to the United States and at least once per week along with daily temperature checks. 
Top players, including Djokovic, have in recent times expressed their displeasure at the stringent measures, something that the ATP and the WTA are also expected to incorporate at their tournaments. 
Gaudenzi said he hoped players will be more receptive to restrictions following the Adria Tour fiasco. 
Stacey Allaster, the new U.S. Open tournament director, said organisers had to take a “leap of faith” regarding players’ willingness to follow the protocols. 
“If you think about it, we really designed this tournament around a bubble,” said Brian Hainline, the chief medical officer for the NCAA. 
“If someone becomes infected, that’s a possibility, if they go out and they put themselves at a behaviour where their behaviour is risky, they’re really taking on a responsibility of saying what I’m doing is not that important to my fellow players.” 
Armenulic, however, believes it will take the sport at least a year to go back to where it was before the pandemic and professional circuit should not resume before next year’s Australian Open. 
“Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality that we are still learning to cope and live with,” Djokovic, a 17-times Grand Slam singles champion, said. 
“I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. 
“I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm. We were wrong and it was too soon.”

Testing to find the virus before patients spread it further is key to controlling the pandemic, especially as lockdowns lift. The Arizona delays - in testing and results reporting - are similar to problems seen earlier in the epidemic, and some labs across the country are facing shortages of supplies, an industry group said. 
In Arizona, Roche Holding recently told Sonora Quest lab, a joint venture between Phoenix-based Banner Health and Quest Diagnostics, that a new instrument it had hoped to get in June would not be delivered until August, said Sonora Chief Operating Officer Sonya Engle. 
“The testing demand has increased significantly,” said Engle, whose lab is responsible for approximately 80% of Arizona COVID-19 tests. “We have reached record highs each day in the past couple weeks.” 
On Friday, she said, the lab received a record 12,000 test orders, double its capacity. It is aiming to ramp up to 17,000 a day but is still working on a deal with a new supplier to make that possible. 
Roche said in response to a request from Reuters that it has been ramping up production since March and is committed to delivering as many tests as possible to the most affected areas, including Arizona. 
“At the height of this global pandemic, demand for diagnostic tests and the instruments to conduct them continues to outstrip supply,” the company said on Tuesday in a statement. 
Last week the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, which represents clinical lab workers and researchers, wrote to Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, urging her to “use the authority of the federal government to obtain and allocate these vital supplies.” 
In a May survey of 100 labs, 50% said they continued to have difficulty getting the swabs, reagents or test kits they needed, according to the letter, which has not been published previously. 
The White House referred questions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which did not immediately respond. 
Arizona, Florida and Texas are all experiencing record surges in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis. Arizona reported 17,000 new cases last week, a 90% increase, with 20% of tests coming back positive. 
The major suppliers to U.S. labs, including Roche and Abbott, sell both lab equipment and proprietary chemicals called reagent kits that are specific to their equipment. When reagent runs low, labs generally cannot switch suppliers. 
In recent days, some free testing sites in Arizona have had to turn patients away because of rising demand, according to local media reports. The Arizona Republic reported that some people had waited as long as 13 hours at one site in Phoenix on Saturday. 
Engle said patients have waited five to six days for results, up from two to three days in May.

The northeastern state suspended its work on its bid last month, citing a need to focus on its response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Despite the suspension, Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) President Coates said authorities recognised the Games’ potential to heal the economy, which is in its biggest downturn since the 1930s. 
“There is already a need for jobs and growth in the Queensland economy arising from the impact of COVID-19,” Coates said in quotes published by The Australian newspaper late on Tuesday. 
Coates said local, state and federal government recognised the potential for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games as a “critical part of the state and nation’s economic recovery in the short term”.

Coates said the AOC stood ready to resume dialogue with the International Olympic Committee once the Queensland state and federal governments gave the green light.

Liverpool, who could potentially seal their first English league crown in 30 years against City next Thursday, are awaiting a decision from a safety advisory group on the venue. 
“Honestly, I would prefer it is at Manchester, otherwise it would be really difficult to organise it,” Klopp told reporters ahead of Wednesday’s league clash against Crystal Palace. 
Authorities could shift the game to a neutral venue due to concerns Liverpool fans might congregate outside the stadium to celebrate their success. 
“I don’t know how it would be but it would not be in Liverpool so it would mean we both have to go somewhere where we both need a hotel. That is the only issue,” Klopp added. 
“Apart from that we play where they send us to but I would prefer it in Manchester ... I’ll wait until the final information is confirmed whether it is Manchester or not. It would be a challenge for both clubs.”

But a resurgence in confirmed coronavirus cases across the country threatens the nascent signs of improvement evident in Tuesday’s economic data. Many states have reported record daily increases in COVID-19 infections, which health experts have blamed on local governments reopening their economies too soon. The economy has stabilized as businesses reopened after closing in mid-March to control the spread of the respiratory illness. 
New home sales jumped 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. Sales dropped 5.2% in April to a pace of 580,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14.7% of housing market sales, rising 2.9% to a pace of 640,000 in May. 
New home sales are drawn from permits. Sales surged 12.7% from a year ago in May. The report followed on the heels of data last week showing home purchase applications at an 11-year high in mid-June and building permits rebounding strongly in May. 
The broader economy slipped into recession in February, leaving nearly 20 million people unemployed as of May. 
In a separate report on Tuesday, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 46.8 in June from 37 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in private sector output. 
The survey’s services sector flash Purchasing Managers Index rose to a reading of 46.7 from 37.5 in May. The contraction in factory activity also ebbed this month, with the flash manufacturing PMI climbing to 49.6 from 39.8 in May. 
The improving trend was also echoed in other PMI surveys around the globe. The IHS Markit’s euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index recovered to 47.5 from May’s 31.9. 
Stocks on Wall Street extended gains on the data. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
UNEMPLOYMENT HURDLE 
The market for new homes is being supported by historic low interest rates and a preference among buyers for single-family homes away from city centers as companies allow employees more flexibility to work from home amid the coronavirus crisis. 
But with record unemployment and companies freezing hiring to deal with weak demand and keep costs under control, a sharp rebound in the housing market is unlikely. 
Last month’s increase in new home sales did little to offset a plunge in sales of existing home in April and May, leaving intact economists’ expectations for a record tumble in residential investment in the second quarter. Homebuilding also rebounded moderately in May after slumping in April. 
Last month, new home sales shot up 45.5% in the Northeast and advanced 29% in the West. They rose 15.2% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, but fell 6.4% in the Midwest. 
The median new house price rose 1.7% to $317,900 in May from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range. New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for about 15% of sales. 
There were 318,000 new homes on the market in May, down from 325,000 in April. At May’s sales pace it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.7 months in April. Nearly two-thirds of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

“We know COVID-19 has not gone away. We implore you to take responsible actions practice appropriate social distancing, wear a mask or face covering anytime you leave your home,” the Texas Children’s Hospital said in a statement, without specifying how many coronavirus patients they admitted. 
Texas reported over 5,000 new infections on Monday, a single-day record for the state. It has also seen COVID-19 hospitalizations hit record highs for 11 days in a row. 
Arizona and Nevada reported record increases in new cases on Tuesday after recording all-time highs last week, according to a Reuters tally. 
The United States recorded a 25% increase in new cases of COVID-19 in the week ended June 21, compared to the previous seven days, as Arizona and Florida joined Texas with record surges in new infections, a Reuters analysis found. 
Ten states, including Texas, reported weekly new infection increases of more than 50%, according to the analysis of data from The COVID Tracking Project https://covidtracking.com, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
While most states are increasing testing, the number of tests coming back positive is rising. At least four states are averaging double-digit rates in the percentage of tests that are positive for the virus: Arizona at 20%, Florida and Utah both at 11%, and Texas at 10%. By contrast, New York, formerly the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has been reporting positive test rates of around 1%. 
The World Health Organization considers positivity rates above 5% to be especially concerning.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday held fast to his claim that the spike in U.S. cases in multiple states was due to testing, not increased spread of the disease. 
“Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!” he tweeted. 
Many of these states are also seeing record hospitalizations - a metric not affected by increased testing. 
The president will speak with students in Phoenix on Tuesday after holding his first campaign rally in months in Oklahoma over the weekend. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to challenge Trump in the Nov. 3 election, called the president’s plans to speak to thousands of supporters in Phoenix “reckless and irresponsible” at a time when the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Arizona is continuing to rise.

Fakhar Zaman, Imran Khan, Kashif Bhatti, Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Rizwan and Wahab Riaz tested positive along with team masseur Malang Ali. 
The PCB on Monday confirmed Haider Ali, Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan had tested positive for the virus. 
“Like Haider, Haris and Shadab, none of the seven players and masseur had reported any prior symptoms of COVID-19 until they underwent first round of testing on Monday ahead of the side’s departure for Manchester,” the PCB said in a statement. 
“The PCB medical panel is already in contact with these players and the masseur, who have been instructed to observe strict quarantine at their homes for their and their families’ wellbeing.” 
Pakistan’s test and limited-overs squads are set to tour England for three tests and three Twenty20 internationals. They were due to fly out later this month before going into quarantine ahead of the first test starting on July 30. 
England director of cricket Ashley Giles said the tour was expected to go ahead. 
“At the moment I don’t think the series is in doubt. We’re far enough away from the start of the test series to not worry about that too much at the moment,” Giles told reporters on Tuesday. 
“There are some more test results coming out later from the rest of the group, so we’ll see what that says. But we’re still hopeful that the Pakistan team will be arriving in the country fairly soon.” 
The rate of new coronavirus cases has been rising fast in the country of 207 million people but Prime Minister Imran Khan a former Pakistan cricket captain has ruled out a nationwide lockdown. 
“The situation in Pakistan is not great at the moment and our thoughts go out to the whole country. Clearly it’s important that we get those guys in this country and we get on with that series,” Giles added. 
England are returning from the coronavirus shutdown with three tests against West Indies next month with the first scheduled to begin in Southampton on July 8 without spectators.

Analysts said there was no specific new development that pushed the pound higher, but with European equities steadying after earlier falls and some calm returning to markets, sterling was able to claw its way upwards. 
The British currency was last up 0.3% at $1.2454 against a dollar broadly flat on the session. Before a sharp drop on Wednesday, the pound had traded around $1.254. 
Against the euro, sterling increased 0.3% to 90.28 pence. 
While the pound is roughly at the same level versus the dollar as in early May, against the euro it has fallen heavily and remains close to three-month lows of 90.775 pence. 
Many analysts think several forces are lined up against the pound, which is vulnerable when broad risk sentiment among investors declines and traders want to own a currency they consider to be safer. 
“Negatives seem to be piling up for GBP as the UK may (a) face a second virus outbreak right as it attempts to re-establish normality, and (b) get caught in U.S. protectionist fire,” ING analysts said in a research note. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled an easing of lockdown restrictions in England, but many health experts are warning of the risk of a second wave of infections. 
Concerns whether Britain can get a deal on its future relationship with the European Union also weighed. 
The pound extended losses when the EU’s chief negotiator said on Wednesday a deal was possible, but Britain needs to give clear signals it is ready to work towards one. 
Positioning data shows that while net sterling bets remain short, they have fallen from their extreme levels seen earlier this year, mostly as a result of a recovery in global markets.

The virus was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread around the world, prompting countries across Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa to step in, many limiting free movement, free speech, public assembly and other civic rights. 
“Authoritarian regimes, not surprisingly, are using the crisis to silence critics and tighten their political grip,” wrote some 500 signatories, including more than 60 former leaders, in an open letter organised by the Stockholm-based Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). 
“Even some democratically elected governments are fighting the pandemic by amassing emergency powers that restrict human rights and enhance state surveillance without regard to legal constraints (or) parliamentary oversight.” 
More than 80 countries have enacted emergency measures, according to the U.S.-based International Center for Non-Profit Law, ranging from curfews and fines for those who breach the rules to extra surveillance, censorship and increased executive powers. 
The overall impact has been a dilution of democratic norms, which has implications for political freedom as well as the ability of governments to handle the crisis and future health emergencies, said IDEA’s secretary-general. 
Among the countries he cited as having introduced authoritarian measures or having fallen short on accountability were the Philippines, Hungary, El Salvador and Turkey. 
“There are legitimate reasons to invoke emergency powers. However, it is always problematic when a government uses emergency powers to clamp down on independent media and other fundamental rights,” said Kevin Casas-Zamora, also a former vice-president and government minister in Costa Rica. 
“We want to draw attention to the plight of democracy in the midst of this crisis. It’s not protecting democracy for its own sake; it’s that democracy has an inherent value in dealing with this pandemic and preparing for the next one.” 
The outbreak has already led to the postponement or cancellation of 66 elections worldwide, a third of them national polls, according to IDEA. Nearly 50 countries have imposed some form of restriction on press freedom, 21 of them democracies. 
For the signatories, including Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former president of Brazil, and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, a fundamental concern is that citizens begin to accept more authoritarian behaviour. 
“Democracy is under threat, and people who care about it must summon the will, the discipline, and the solidarity to defend it. At stake are the freedom, health, and dignity of people everywhere,” they wrote."

Safe form of ultraviolet light kills airborne coronavirus 
Ceiling fixtures emitting a safe form of ultraviolet light called far-UVC would be very efficient at killing airborne coronaviruses, according to a study by researchers at Columbia University. ""A very low exposure to far-UVC light killed well over 99.9% of the exposed virus,"" lead researcher Dr. David Brenner told Reuters. The researchers put coronavirus particles into little droplets and floated them in the air in front of far-UVC lights, then collected the viruses and tested them to see how many were still active. The study, published on Wednesday in Science Reports, used coronaviruses that cause common colds. ""But in our subsequent ongoing studies we have found that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is killed in just the same way by far-UVC light,"" Brenner said. The idea would be to install overhead far-UVC lights in public locations, where they would be ""continuously killing microbes, including the COVID-19 virus - and so limiting the spread of the virus,"" Brenner said, adding that far-UVC manufacturers are already ramping up production. ""We don't see far-UVC light as an alternative to masks and social distancing,"" Brenner said. ""We see it as a new extra weapon that we can use in the battle against COVID-19.""

Cells that help blood to clot “over-activated” by the coronavirus 
The effect of the new coronavirus on platelets in the blood may help explain the excessive blood clotting that has led to serious complications and strokes in some COVID-19 patients. It is the job of platelets to recognize wounds and prevent bleeding by forming clots. They also recruit immune cells and generate inflammation. On Tuesday, researchers reported in the journal Blood that the new coronavirus drastically changes platelet gene expression and function. The inflammatory proteins generated by the virus cause platelets to become ""hyperreactive"" and form clots more easily and more often, coauthor Robert Campbell of the University of Utah told Reuters. The effect was correlated with patient illness severity, his team found. In a separate not-yet-peer-reviewed study, researchers found that platelets in 20% of COVID-19 patients contain molecules with the genetic code of the coronavirus. It is not clear yet whether the virus actually targets the platelets, or if the platelets contain the full virus, said study coauthor Eric Boilard of Universitaire de Québec. ""What was very obvious was the impressive level of platelet activation in COVID-19,"" Boilard said. The findings may open up new avenues to treat clot related complications in COVID-19.

Antibodies might not be sole proof of prior coronavirus infection 
Antibodies to the novel coronavirus should not be considered the only evidence that someone has recovered from COVID-19, researchers say. They studied nine confirmed coronavirus patients from seven families, along with eight of their household members who later became ill with COVID-19 symptoms. The original patients all developed antibodies to the virus, as shown by blood tests after they recovered. The relatives who got sick, however, had negative antibody tests, but six of the eight had other immune cells in their blood that suggested they had been infected. For up to 80 days after their symptoms began, they had T cells - a key component of the immune system - that could recognize and target the coronavirus. ""T cell responses may be more sensitive indicators of SARS-Co-V-2 exposure than antibodies,"" the researchers said on Monday in a not-yet-peer-reviewed paper. ""Our results indicate that epidemiological data relying only on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may lead to a substantial underestimation of prior exposure to the virus."" (bit.ly/2Yt2Frl) 
Details of dexamethasone study showing reduced death risk released 
Last week's announcement that the cheap and widely used steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced deaths in severely ill COVID-19 patients generated both excitement and skepticism, because the British researchers announced the result without publishing full details. On Monday, they posted their data online, in advance of full peer-review. They compared 2,104 coronavirus patients who received dexamethasone with 4,321 patients who did not. Overall, 21.6% of patients who got dexamethasone and 24.6% of those who got standard care died within 28 days. But the effect on mortality rates varied depending on how sick patients were when they entered the study. Dexamethasone reduced the death rate by one-third in patients who needed a ventilator to help them breath (from 40.7% to 29.0%) and by one-fifth in patients receiving supportive oxygen without an invasive ventilator (from 25.0% to 21.5%). The steroid did not reduce deaths in patients not receiving respiratory support. The World Health Organization has said dexamethasone should be reserved for serious COVID-19 cases in which it has been shown to provide benefits. (bit.ly/2Yuc7L9; reut.rs/2BFVm6H)

Tourists to Hawaii will be exempted from the quarantine rule upon arrival from different states if they carry a valid coronavirus test result prior to the visit, Governor David Ige said late on Wednesday. 
“Beginning August 1, we will be implementing pre-travel testing program for travellers to Hawaii as an alternative for 14-day mandatory quarantine,” Ige said in a briefing. 
The current 14-day mandatory quarantine for everyone traveling into the state began in March, with the governor later extending it until the end of June. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the DOJ gave its support to a lawsuit challenging the state’s coronavirus measures, saying visitors are being denied rights granted to most island residents. The lawsuit was filed by Nevada and California residents who own property in Hawaii. 
Tourism is a big part of Hawaii’s economy - more than 10.4 million visitors came to the islands last year, supporting some 216,000 jobs in a population of around 1.4 million, according to the state tourism authority. 
The state at one point considered sweeping use of GPS-enabled ankle bracelets or smartphone tracking apps to enforce stay-at-home orders given to arriving air passengers. 
However, that plan was put on the back burner after the Hawaii attorney general’s office raised concerns. 
The United States has recorded about 2.4 million cases of coronavirus infections as of early Thursday, with nearly 122,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
Hawaii has had over 830 cases of infection and 17 deaths from the outbreak. The state’s average of one death per 100,000 people is among the lowest in the United States.

A resurgence in confirmed coronavirus cases across the country, linked to the reopening of businesses, is also dimming the outlook. Roughly 29 million people were collecting unemployment checks at the end of May. 
The Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy’s health, is unlikely to show a big improvement, more than a month after many businesses resumed operation after closing in mid-March in an effort slow the spread of the respiratory illness. 
Companies are hiring, but others are cutting jobs at nearly the same pace. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
“There were some businesses that tried to maintain their workforce, waiting to see what would happen as businesses reopened,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “Even as the economy is picking up they are not seeing a lot of demand and are deciding that they don’t need that many workers.” 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits likely totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.3 million for the week ended June 20, down from 1.508 million in the prior week, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in late March, but the pace of decline has slowed and they are still more than double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
From manufacturing to transportation, retail and leisure and hospitality industries companies are restructuring to adapt to a vastly changed landscape, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies. State and local governments, whose budgets have been squeezed by the COVID-19 fight, are also cutting jobs. 
Rising coronavirus infections in many parts of the country, including California, Texas and Florida, are likely to hurt employment as some people stay away from restaurants and other consumer-facing establishments, even if businesses are not shut down again. 
“It’s looking like a bumpy ride,” said Josh Wright, chief economist at Wrightside Advisors in New York. 
In a busy calendar for economic data, other reports out Thursday are expected to show a big rebound in orders for big-ticket goods in May and to confirm the U.S. economy shrank at a 5% annualized rate in the first quarter, the biggest contraction since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. 
When second-quarter output is reported next month, the pace of contraction could exceed 30%. 
STALLED PROGRESS 
The jobless claims report on Thursday is also expected to show a modest change in the unemployment rolls. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid likely dipped to 19.968 million in the week ending June 13 from 20.544 million in the prior week, according to the Reuters survey. 
These so-called continued claims are reported with a one-week lag. Continuing claims have dropped from a record 24.912 million in early May, with economists crediting the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, giving businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. 
Progress, however, appears to have waned. The continuing claims data will cover the week that the government surveyed households for June’s unemployment rate. 
The measurement of the jobless rate has been biased down since March by people incorrectly misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.” 
The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the employment report, is working with the Census Bureau to correct this problem in upcoming reports. 
Without the misclassification problem, the unemployment rate would have been 16.3% in May instead of 13.3% and would have peaked at about 19.7% in April. 
“At least so far, hiring firms are barely overcoming the firing firms,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. “We may not see a major decline in the June unemployment rate. Indeed, if BLS finally corrects its misclassification problem, we could actually see the rate rise from the May published rate.”

Economists also say continuing claims have probably stalled because some people who have returned to work have been rehired on a part-time basis. That would allow them to continue receiving benefits while still being on company payrolls. 
The government has expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include the self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including through lost employment, reduced hours and wages. 
Part-time workers accounted for two-fifths of the 2.5 million increase in employment in May.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 2.3% last month as demand rose across the board, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders dropped 6.5% in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders advancing 1.0% in May. Core capital goods orders fell 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in May.

The reopening of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park that was earlier scheduled for July 17 will be delayed until Disneyland receives an approval from state officials, the company said. 
In late January, the pandemic started battering businesses across Disney’s global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland. 
Last month, the company estimated that global lockdown measures aimed at tamping down the spread of the contagion slashed its profit by $1.4 billion, mostly from its shuttered theme parks. 
The coronavirus-ravaged U.S. economy has begun to reopen but there is little clarity either on the pace and durability of the recovery, with new cases in the country continuing to rise. 
Last week, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it is temporarily shutting some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina. 
Disney had also come under fire earlier as unions representing 17,000 workers at its Disneyland Resort in California expressed concerns to the state’s governor about not being convinced that the theme park will be safe enough to reopen by the company’s target date. 
California witnessed its largest ever spike in confirmed new cases on Tuesday, with an additional 7,149 infections taking the state total to 190,222.

The report issued by the Government Accountability Office on Thursday marked the first review of the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and made recommendations to lawmakers how to improve the fight to come out crisis. 
Some of its harshest criticism was reserved for the Small Business Administration (SBA), which oversees a $670 billion emergency loan programme to help companies survive the pandemic, and the lack of a plan from the Department of Transportation to improve the aviation sector’s response to outbreaks. 
Detailing its findings on the coronavirus testing data, the GAO said the data that was collected at times included antibody tests that detect prior infections, and sometimes included counts on the number of samples tested, which could include multiple tests for one person. 
“The absence of complete and consistent COVID-19 testing data reported through May 31, 2020, has made it more difficult to track and know the infection rate, mitigate the effect of infections, and inform decisions on reopening communities,” the watchdog said. 
It said the United States is also missing a national aviation-preparedness plan for infectious diseases. 
“While the Department of Transportation agreed that a plan is needed, as of May 2020, no such plan had been developed,” the watchdog said. It said the Transportation Department has maintained that other U.S. agencies should take the lead in planning for outbreaks. 
As part of its recommendations to U.S. lawmakers, the watchdog said it is urging them to take legislative action to require the Transportation Department to work with others to develop a national plan. 
It criticised the SBA for failing to give detailed descriptions of loans made in its data, and not outlining plans to review loans worth less than $2 million. 
“We encountered the most difficulty trying to obtain information from the Small Business Administration (SBA),” said the watchdog,. “SBA to date has failed to provide information critical to our review.” 
The SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The level of transparency around U.S. government spending to fight the pandemic has been a contentious issue between various watchdogs and government agencies. 
According to the watchdog, the U.S. government has set aside $2.6 trillion worth of spending to fight the pandemic, but spending so far is unknown as all agencies are not required to report their expenditures until July 2020.

The plan, backed by 98% of the shareholder capital that cast a vote at the online meeting, will see Berlin take a 20% stake in Lufthansa and two board seats. 
Shares in the company, which employs around 138,000 people, closed 7.1% higher, having risen strongly earlier after top shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele dropped objections to the deal. 
Also on Thursday, European Union regulators approved Lufthansa’s 6 billion euro recapitalisation, part of the bailout deal, subject to a ban on dividends, share buybacks and some acquisitions until state support is repaid. 
The approvals will come as a relief to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who could ill afford another high-profile business collapse following the failure of payments firm Wirecard. 
But tough decisions lie ahead, with Lufthansa working on a restructuring plan in which up to 22,000 jobs could be at risk - although CEO Carsten Spohr told Bild newspaper that hours and wages could be reduced by a fifth instead of axing a fifth of jobs. 
Lufthansa has been brought to its knees by COVID-19 and what promises to be a protracted travel slump, and like many rivals, sought state help to stay afloat. Even after Thursday’s gains, its shares are down almost 40% this year. 
Concerned a government stake would make it harder for Lufthansa to make tough restructuring decisions, Thiele had instead proposed an indirect government holding in the airline via Germany’s KfW development bank. 
That sparked fears the bailout would fail and Lufthansa would have to seek protection from creditors within days. 
Thiele, who recently increased his stake in Lufthansa to 15.5%, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine daily that “differences remain with government representatives.” 
But he said he could not have voted for insolvency, adding he would continue to seek to influence the company’s development, though he declined to say how. 
The 79-year-old brakes billionaire said it was in the interests of Lufthansa employees that management quickly negotiate restructuring with unions. 
Lufthansa struck a deal overnight with the UFO union representing German cabin crew that is set to reap more than 500 million euros in savings, including steps to stop pay rises, cut working hours, and a cap on pension contributions. 
More talks are scheduled on Friday with services union Verdi. 
Spohr said the government did not plan to get involved in the operations of the airline.

The findings are the first detailed look at a range of neurological complications of COVID-19, the researchers said, and underline a need for larger studies to find the mechanisms behind them and assist the search for treatments. 
“This (is) an important snapshot of the brain-related complications of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients. It is critically important that we continue to collect this information to really understand this virus fully,” said Sarah Pett, a University College London professor who co-led the work. 
The study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal on Thursday, looked in detail at 125 cases from across the UK. Co-lead researcher Benedict Michael, from Liverpool University, said it was important to note that it focused on severe cases. 
Data was collected between April 2 and April 26 - when the disease was spreading exponentially in the UK. 
The most common brain complication seen was stroke, which was reported in 77 of 125 patients. Of these, most were in patients over 60, and most were caused by a blood clot in the brain, known as an ischaemic stroke. 
The study also found that 39 of the 125 patients showed signs of confusion or changes in behaviour reflecting an altered mental state. Of these, nine had unspecified brain dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, and seven had inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis. 
Michael said the findings were an important early step towards defining COVID-19’s effect on the brain. “We now need detailed studies to understand the possible biological mechanisms ... so we can explore potential treatments,” he said.

There will be no spectators, no sponsors or VIP guests wandering the paddock and limited social interaction even between team mates. 
Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies reckons the biggest challenge, for his mechanics at least, could be having to wear face masks at all times in the heat and tight confines of the garage. 
“We have been starting to get used to it all of us now, because it’s becoming part of our normal life,” the Frenchman told reporters in a video call ahead of the July 5 opener to discuss the ‘new normal’ and safety protocols. 
“Here at Ferrari it’s compulsory, so we wear it (the mask) at all times in the factory... but it’s one thing to wear it in the office environment, another to wear it when it would be 40 degrees at the racetrack.” 
Ferrari will try to schedule regular breaks for breathing exercises. 
Formula One will have three races on successive weekends to get the season started, with two at Spielberg’s Red Bull Ring before moving on to Hungary. Others will then follow in quick succession. 
Teams are limited to 80 people each, with everyone having to register a negative COVID-19 test less than four days before arriving in Austria. 
Testing will then be conducted every five days, rather than the two initially mooted. 
“The Formula One paddock will be a bubble,” said Mekies. “But inside... you will have an individual bubble for each team with pretty much no or minimum interaction between a bubble or a team and another. 
“So you will not see, as we all like and as you used to see, people from a team having a casual chat with people from another team. 
“Inside the team bubble, which is inside the F1 bubble, we will also do more bubbles,” added the Frenchman. 
“So you will have probably the car 16 (Charles Leclerc) bubble and the car 5 (Sebastian Vettel) bubble and inside them probably engineers and mechanics and so forth.” 
The separation means anyone who tests positive will have had limited contact with others, with tested stand-ins ready to be slotted in if needed. 
Team members will also either spend their time at the track or hotel, with no going out.

By Liz Hampton and Jennifer Hiller 
HOUSTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies slammed the brakes on returning staff to their Houston offices as COVID-19 cases soared and top hospitals warned they could soon run out of beds for the most severely ill patients. 
Texas officials imposed restrictions as new cases in the state topped 5,000 on three consecutive days as of Thursday. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds were 97% full at Houston’s Texas Medical Center, which said it may soon move to increase ICU capacity assignments, officials said. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced a phased reopening of shops, bars and amusement parks from May 1, and businesses have rolled out their own office restarts. But on Wednesday, he warned of a “massive outbreak” and urged people to stay at home. 
Many energy firms qualify as essential, and therefore are free to staff normally, but the surge in illness and hospitalizations has prompted large employers to delay or halt openings. 
Halliburton Co, the second-largest U.S. oilfield service company by revenue, delayed for two weeks a second phase of its return-to-work plan, and power producer Calpine pushed back the start of returning non-essential workers to offices until August from July 6, representatives for the two companies said. 
Chevron also has delayed its reopening plans for further evaluation, said spokesman Sean Comey. About 5% of its Houston office staff and about 2% of its San Ramon, California, workforce are in their offices now, he said. 
Midcoast Energy, a natural gas pipeline company, reopened on June 1 but sent Houston employees home three weeks later after two tested positive for the virus, said a person familiar with the matter. President Robert Bond did not respond to requests for comment. 
Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips returned some white-collar workers to their campuses in May or this month. Exxon will remain below 50% capacity at its Houston-area facility, a spokesman said. Conoco is prepared to change its return-to-office plan if needed, a spokesman said. 
Phillips 66 said the vast majority of its staff had returned and would remain working from their offices. 
“We are a critical infrastructure industry and have an ongoing obligation to continue operating,” spokesman Joe Gannon said, noting that the company follows Centers for Disease Control and government advisories.

Airlines such as Australia’s Qantas (QAN.AX), Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines are looking to defer plane deliveries from Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) and this means postponed demand for cobalt and nickel alloys used in jet turbine blades. 
(GRAPHIC: Cobalt demand from aerospace - here) 
But this is only part of the story. 
“The harsh high temperature and pressure environments of the jet engine necessitates regular replacement of turbine blades,” said CRU analyst George Heppel. “But planes are grounded, turbine blades aren’t being used and don’t need replacing.” 
Heppel expects cobalt demand for aerospace rotating parts to total 4,442 tonnes this year, a drop of 18% from 2019 and the lowest since 2011. Overall, he forecasts a 6,300 tonne surplus this year and global consumption at 131,800 tonnes. 
(GRAPHIC: Cobalt market balance - here) 
Prices of cobalt metal, at around $30,000 a tonne, are down more than 15% since early February and are the lowest since last August. As surpluses become more visible lower levels are expected. 
(GRAPHIC: Cobalt prices - here) 
Roskill analyst Ying Lu said recent price convergence between higher grade cobalt metal used for alloys and standard grade was a signal of weak demand from the aerospace sector. She expects a relatively balanced market this year compared with a 10,000 tonne surplus last year. 
    “The pandemic has affected demand and supply. Cobalt mined from (Democratic Republic of) Congo is typically exported for refining through Durban in South Africa, where there was lockdown (to halt the spread of the new coronavirus), which created logistical disruptions.” 
Cobalt from the DRC comes in the form of hydroxide, which is turned into chemicals for the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles. Much of it goes to China, which dominates the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries. 
Falling sales of electric vehicles in China, including by Tesla (TSLA.O) and BYD (002594.SZ) (1211.HK) earlier this year and in the second half of last year, have also weakened cobalt consumption. 
However, demand from the electric vehicle sector, which represents 20% of global demand, is expected to recover at a faster pace than from aerospace due to government incentives to promote clean air initiatives.

Spikes of cases in several U.S. states including Texas, Arizona and Florida are raising concerns that the United States is relaxing lockdowns too fast and that hospitals may run out of space. Houston has considered turning part of a local stadium complex into excess hospital capacity - but local officials say that’s not currently part of their immediate plans. 
The Texas Medical Center system in Houston was expected to fill its last ICU bed on Thursday, but it has created a COVID “war room” and can handle a 66% surge in additional ICU patients with strategies including reassigning staff, delaying elective procedures, putting beds closer together and using regular beds for emergency use. 
They calculate they will run out of space on July 6 if the current increase in Texas severe cases continues. 
The ICU at nearby Houston Methodist was also nearly full as of Thursday. They are preparing to surge, and said that their experience with coronavirus patients has helped them save beds in the hospital’s ward for the most severe cases. 
“We’re not intubating as many patients, we have lots of drugs like convalescent plasma and remdesivir, and our process of proning patients, (putting them on their stomachs) is allowing us to manage a lot more patients on acute care floors then we were able to do in March and April,” said hospital ICU chief Dr. Faisal Masud. 
In Arizona, adult intensive care beds were 88% occupied statewide as cases continued to surge. 
Arizona’s Governor Doug Ducey said on Thursday that his state has the hospital capacity to handle the influx of patients despite increasing numbers of occupied hospital beds, intensive care beds and ventilators being used. 
“Our hospitals are likely to hit surge capacity very soon,” Ducey said, adding that the state could handle the influx. “Where we are right now and what we expect is manageable.” he said. 
Arizona has the ability to reopen a shuttered hospital and open field hospitals to help handle surges in ill patients. 
In Florida, COVID hospital patients at AdventHealth Systems also are younger than earlier in the pandemic and less likely to need critical care, said Dr. Vincent Hsu, AdventHealth’s infection control officer for Florida. 
“We’re not seeing nearly as sick patients as we had in the first part (of the outbreak),” Hsu said at a news conference. “The patients that are coming in tend to be a little bit younger. And as a result, they don’t tend to utilize the significant ICU resources or the ventilator resources.” 
Ed Jimenez, chief Executive of University of Florida Health’s Shands hospital in Gainesville, said that he could cut the number of patients in his hospital by a third by stopping elective procedures. 
“So we have levers we can pull that slow down the inflow of patients,” Jimenez said.

Utah Royals forward Christen Press and Portland Thorns midfielder Tobin Heath, who played with Rapinoe on last year’s World Cup-wininng U.S. squad, both cited the virus as their reason for skipping the event that begins on Saturday. 
“It is deeply painful not to be able to play the game I love, and to watch the broader effects of the global pandemic on our league, sports and our world,” Press said in a statement. 
“Regrettably, given the uncertainty created by COVID-19, I must elect not to participate in this tournament.” 
Heath said the risks associated with the virus outweighed her desire to return to competition. 
“Although I want to be on the field with my teammates doing what I love because of the uncertainty and risks created by COVID-19, I have chosen not to participate in the NWSL Challenge Cup,” said Heath. 
It was previously reported that Rapinoe, who plays for the OL Reign in Tacoma, Washington, would skip the event but it was confirmed on Tuesday in her team’s news release to announce its squad. A reason for her decision was not given. 
“Megan let us know that she has decided not play in the tournament,” said OL Reign Chief Executive Bill Predmore. “Like all NWSL players, she was given the option to participate ... but we understand and respect her decision.” 
The NWSL, which is the top U.S. women’s soccer league, was originally scheduled to kick off its 2020 season in mid-April but was delayed because of the coronavirus. 
The Utah tournament, which would see players subject to testing throughout, would make the NWSL the first team-sport league in the United States to resume competition since live action ground to a halt in mid-March. 
The Orlando Pride said this week they decided to withdraw from the event after players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19.

Barca needed a late goal from substitute Ivan Rakitic to see off a determined Athletic side and although they picked up a third win in four matches since the season re-started, they again failed to sparkle. 
“When teams offer you little space you have to be very precise and agile and we have been lacking that since we returned,” Setien told a virtual news conference. 
“It’s not been easy and we are missing something overall, a bit of spark. Our opponents have a lot to do with this because they are sticking together and leaving hardly any space and we’re finding it hard to open them up. 
“But I think we’ll start to find it easier the more the season goes on.” 
Barca thrashed Real Mallorca 4-0 on their return after the long break but looked rusty in last week’s 2-0 victory over struggling Leganes and on Friday were held 0-0 at Sevilla, allowing Real Madrid to go top of the league on Sunday. 
The win over Athletic took Barca three points ahead of Madrid but Zinedine Zidane’s side will go back to the top of the table with victory over Real Mallorca on Wednesday. 
Setien was not pleased with how his side started against Athletic but praised youngsters Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati for helping to open their opponents up when they came off the bench. 
“We were more relaxed in the second half and played much better. Ansu and Riqui gave us dynamism and allowed us to have longer periods of possession,” Setien said.

Borrowers are adjusting earnings as if the crisis had never happened, known as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and coronavirus (Ebitdac), or “earnings before coronavirus.” 
“Companies may be keeping earnings artificially high in order to avoid a financial covenant breach. It could delay a restructuring that perhaps should be happening earlier,” said Jane Gray, head of European research at Covenant Review. 
Ebitda is a key measure of performance and business valuation. Loosening documentation over the past few years has gifted borrowers a great level of flexibility to adjust their earnings via numerous exclusions and add-backs. It has become common practice to estimate generous cost savings and synergies on buyouts to lower leverage and make deals acceptable to regulators and investors. 
However, a growing number of lawyers and investors argue that adding back coronavirus-related costs is controversial and not appropriate due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. 
“The language in documentation allows such flexibility and borrowers are interpreting it in a way that is favourable for them. But is it a correct interpretation? It is controversial,” a leveraged loan lawyer said. 
FAIRY TALE 
German beauty retailer Douglas, which has 2,400 stores across Europe, is one such company to make coronavirus adjustments. 
Last month, the leveraged loan borrower added 15m back to earnings for its second quarter results ended 31 March, to take account of what it termed, “staff and rent related idle costs in connection with our closed stores.” 
Douglas’ reported Ebitda was a 1m loss in the second quarter, compared with adjusted Ebitdac of a 23m profit. 
The 15m add-back also pushed leverage down by around 0.3 times, according to fintech data provider 9fin. 
Changing the numbers to take account of coronavirus is seen as controversial as no one knows how long the pandemic it will last and how it will play out. 
“When it comes to coronavirus, it’s a different scenario. Companies are estimating based on a hypothetical situation, and no one knows how it will turn out,” said Sabrina Fox, executive adviser at European Leveraged Finance Association (ELFA). 
“Ebitdac is just a fairy tale and using it in covenant calculations would be like living in a world of imagination.” 
In addition, the ELFA whose members include Allianz Global Investors and Janus Henderson Investors urged loan borrowers and high-yield issuers not to use Ebitdac as a calculation metric to incur additional debt. 
“We discourage companies from stripping off the effects of the pandemic only to wind up with more leverage,” said Fox. 
“It is by no means guaranteed that Ebitdac reflects forward-looking operating trends, and as such it should not be relied on as a calculation metric for any purpose under debt documents.” 
GETTING CREATIVE 
Apart from earnings adjustments, some borrowers have taken another approach to covenant calculations by using 2019 historical figures, instead of 2020 figures in a bid to avoid breaches. 
US ticket and concert company Live Nation made amendments in April with existing lenders that allowed the firm to use 2019 earnings to calculate the consolidated net leverage ratio covenant for the fourth quarter of 2020 through to the second quarter of 2021, according to the firm’s result announcement. 
US luggage maker Samsonite also amended loan terms so that it could use 2019 Ebitda figures in covenant calculations from the end of September 2021 until end of March 2022. 
“It’s really the same thing,” said Gray at Covenant Review. “Using last year’s figures is simply a way of justifying the quantification of the adjustment they are making. They are seeking to ‘normalise’ Ebitda as if Covid had not happened.” 
The key reason for existing lenders or institutional investors to support those amendments is to limit the amount of defaulted loans in their portfolio, taking a view that the pandemic will be a short-term matter, bankers and investors said. 
“It’s a sticking plaster solution,” a loan banker said. 
However, no-one knows how long such flexibility could last and when lenders’ patience will dry up. 
“I don’t think anyone has a clue on any of it. It’s all being done under the illusion that the world will return to normal in a couple months. By now that should be an obvious lie.” said an investor in the US. “Somebody is wrong.”

In addition to onsite and pharmacy testing, CVS also will offer symptom screenings, flu vaccines and other immunizations and add-on services like contact tracing for employees exposed to the virus. 
The unexpected surge in COVID-19 in states in the South and West has increased demand for testing workers on a regular basis, such as every two weeks or every month, said Troy Brennan, chief medical officer of the company, which operates pharmacies, a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service and the Aetna insurance plan. 
“The general perception is that there is not going to be a sustained lull over the course of the summer, and in fact it looks like it is building somewhat, and that is changing people’s views,” Brennan said. 
More than 20 states including Florida, Arizona, and Texas, have reported an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks. 
The United States has had about a quarter of the global total in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
States hard hit early in the pandemic, such as New York and New Jersey, have experienced dramatic declines in cases. But many states that reopened before achieving safety metrics or are not requiring mask wearing are seeing record increases. Overall U.S. cases rose 25% last week with 10 states reporting a greater than 50% rise in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis. 
Wall Street firm Jefferies forecast there will be 400 million to 700 million tests during the current COVID-19 outbreak, representing billions of dollars for test suppliers and makers, as well as lab companies. 
Other companies such as Labcorp Holdings and Quest Diagnostics Inc have also created testing services for corporations. Quest is working with Delta Air Lines. 
But CVS, with its PBM services and insurance business, serves some of the largest U.S. companies with hundreds of thousands of employees. 
The new service, dubbed Return Ready, is open to all companies, not just current customers. 
CVS declined to provide details about companies that have already signed up, but said they are in discussions with media companies, financials services, sports leagues and the public sector. 
ANTIBODY TESTING NOT INCLUDED 
Return Ready is aimed at large employers or smaller ones who self-insure, meaning they pay for employee healthcare costs rather than insurers - and instead pay CVS to manage the tests and other services. 
CVS declined to provide pricing for the program. Diagnostic tests can cost more than $100 each. 
While the U.S. government has required health insurers to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing, that is largely restricted to “medically necessary” testing for those with symptoms and does not cover these back-to-work programs. 
CVS is not offering tests that detect coronavirus antibodies to show prior infection. 
Earlier this year, antibody tests were seen as key to getting the United States back to work, while in Europe some countries have considered related “immunity passports.” But it is not yet known whether the presence of those antibodies confers some level of immunity against future infection or how long any immunity might last. 
Healthcare consulting firm Willis Towers Watson does not advise employers to use antibody tests because of the uncertainty about what they indicate, health management practice leader Jeff Levin-Scherz said in a recent interview. 
Even regular diagnostic testing offers no guarantees. If everyone is tested and the tests are completely accurate, workers can still become infected a day after they test negative, he said. 
“You still couldn’t assume that your workplace is a bubble and no COVID would come in,” Levin-Scherz said.

People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 100,704 from 100,943 on Friday. 
There were 1,539 people in intensive care on Saturday, slightly down from 1,578 on Friday and maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 79,914 were declared recovered against 78,249 a day earlier.

(Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered at Michigan’s state Capitol in Lansing on Thursday to protest Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s request to extend the state of emergency to combat COVID-19, an appeal Republican lawmakers there have opposed. 
The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters and allies of President Donald Trump organized thousands of people for “Operation Gridlock,” jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer’s strict stay-at-home order. 
That was one of the country’s first major anti-lockdown rallies, and helped sparked a wave of similar events nationwide. 
The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump’s re-election promoted protests in electoral battleground states, such as Michigan. 
Many people at Thursday’s protest, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump signs, appeared to be ignoring state social-distancing guidelines as they clustered together within 6 feet of each other. Few people wore masks. 
“Governor Whitmer, and our state legislature, it’s over with. Open this state,” Mike Detmer, a Republican U.S. congressional candidate running for the state’s 8th district spot held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin, told the crowd. “Let’s get businesses back open again. Let’s make sure there are jobs to go back to.” 
Other speakers at the “American Patriot Rally,” which had different organizers than the mid-April protest, questioned the deadliness of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. They also said Whitmer’s stay-at-home order violated constitutional rights, and urged people to open their businesses on May 1 in disregard of her order. 
As the event began around 9 a.m. under steady rainfall, some protesters chanted “USA” and “lock her up,” referring to Whitmer, a Democrat, but alluding to a refrain often chanted at 2016 Trump rallies directed at Hillary Clinton. 
‘FREEDOM OF SPEECH’ 
State authorities have warned that protesters could be ticketed for violating social-distancing rules. The mayor of Lansing, Andy Schor, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was “disappointed” protesters would put themselves and others at risk, but recognized that Whitmer’s order still allowed people to “exercise their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.” 
Whitmer has acknowledged that her order was the strictest in the country. Protesters, many from more rural, Trump-leaning parts of Michigan, have argued it has crippled the economy statewide even as the majority of deaths from the virus are centered on the southeastern Detroit metro area. 
Many states, including Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Carolina and Ohio, have already moved to restart parts of their economies following weeks of mandatory lockdowns that have thrown nearly one in six American workers out of their jobs. 
Organizers of the mid-April protest in Michigan took credit when Whitmer later in April rolled back some of the most controversial elements of her order, such as bans on people traveling to their other properties. 
State legislative approval of Whitmer’s state of emergency declaration, which gives her special executive powers, is set to expire after Thursday. 
She has asked for a 28-day extension, though Republican lawmakers in control of the statehouse who want to see a faster economic opening have signaled they could reject her request. 
Regardless, Whitmer’s stay-at-home order is set to continue through May 15, though she has said she could loosen restrictions as health experts determine new cases of COVID-19 are being successfully controlled. 
On Wednesday, she said the construction industry could get back to work starting May 7. 
Public health authorities warn that increasing human interactions now without appropriate safety measures may spark a fresh surge of infections.

In a three-page letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, the DOJ said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution required churches and other houses of worship be given equal treatment under the law, even when a health emergency has been declared. 
“Simply put, there is no pandemic exception to the U.S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband wrote in the letter. 
A spokesman for Newsom could not be reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon. 
California has one of the strictest stay-at-home orders still in place in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The governor’s four-stage plan allows each of California’s 58 counties to gradually open based on the number of tests, cases, hospitalizations and deaths, among other factors. 
Newsom this week eased restrictions for some counties, making it easier for them to move toward reopening retail stores and restaurants for sit-down dining. He said the state was in discussions with major sports leagues about resuming play.. 
The governor also said some workers may begin returning to offices where working from home was not practical, including the entertainment industry in a list of businesses exempted from restrictions. 
“California has not shown why interactions in offices and studios of the entertainment industry, and in-person operations to facilitate nonessential ecommerce, are included on the list as being allowed with social distancing where telework is not practical, while gatherings with social distancing for purposes of religious worship are forbidden, regardless of whether remote worship is practical or not,” the DOJ said in its letter to Newsom.

Immune system’s T cells play a role in attacking the coronavirus 
While the immune system's B cells make antibodies that block the novel coronavirus, its T cells provide another line of attack, according to new research. Researchers found that T cells from recovered patients can target the virus. That is promising news for vaccine developers because it is ""consistent with normal, good, antiviral immunity,"" Shane Crotty, from the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, told Reuters. ""The types of immune responses targeted by many candidate vaccines are now shown to be the types of immune responses seen in COVID-19 cases that successfully recovered from the disease."" Furthermore, some people who never had COVID-19 nonetheless had T cells that could attack the virus, Crotty's team reported on Thursday in the journal Cell. This suggests that past exposure to other coronaviruses (such as those that cause the common cold) had somehow primed their T cells to recognize and attack this new coronavirus. That might influence their susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, he said, either preventing them from getting infected or from developing severe disease. (bit.ly/36bRpSD) 
Coronavirus affects adults and children differently 
Children appear to have much lower rates of infection with the new coronavirus than adults, but most reports on COVID-19 in youngsters have focused only on small groups. A team of Chinese researchers has analyzed data from 24 earlier studies involving a total of nearly 2,600 children with COVID-19, enabling them to shed light on ways in which the virus acts differently in pediatric patients. They reported on Sunday in the Journal of Medical Virology that the most common laboratory test abnormality observed in adults was a low level of immune cells called lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). This condition, known as lymphopenia, developed in up to 80% of adults but in less than 10% of children. On the other hand, children - particularly infants - were more likely to have elevated levels of cardiac enzymes that indicate heart injury. They also found additional differences. The rates of severe illness and critical illness in adults were 14% and 5%, respectively (according to earlier reports). That compared with 4.4% and 0.9% in children. Fever occurred in up to 99% of adults but in 43% of children; cough in up to 82% of adults but 43% of children. Shortness of breath and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were rare in children, but digestive tract symptoms like diarrhea were more common in kids than in grownups. (bit.ly/3dXpTLf) 
Coronavirus can infect patients taking hydroxychloroquine 
Taking hydroxychloroquine for other medical conditions might not protect against the new coronavirus, French doctors say. The drug had nearly become a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 in many hospitals, even though randomized trials have not yet confirmed its value. But people around the world use decades-old hydroxychloroquine to treat malaria as well as inflammatory conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and researchers are seeing occasional cases of coronavirus infection in these patients despite long-term use of the drug. A report on Sunday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy describes two such patients, one with rheumatoid arthritis and the other with a condition called mixed connectivitis. The authors say they also know of at least three other patients in Italy who became sick with COVID-19 despite taking hydroxychloroquine for chronic arthritis. ""Patients actually taking long-term hydroxychloroquine are potentially immunosuppressed patients since they are living with chronic inflammatory diseases and thus do not represent the general population exposed to COVID-19,"" the French doctors acknowledge. ""However, these observational data are not in favor of a universal protective effect of hydroxychloroquine."" (bit.ly/3cDC7bH) 
New barcoding technique can help process 100,000 screening tests per day 
A big challenge in preventing the spread of the new coronavirus is to identify and quarantine infected people who do not have symptoms. Laboratory workers can test blood samples from thousands of patients per day, still not enough to efficiently screen heavily populated areas. Now researchers at the OSU James Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, Ohio say they have a way to screen over 100,000 samples per day. Their system, dubbed REMBRANDT, makes copies of the virus and introduces two barcodes that simplify patient identification. Barcoding of samples for screening is not new, but the OSU method takes a unique biochemical approach, aiming for a single barcoding and virus-copying step. ""Barcodes on products in the supermarket, and molecular barcodes for REMBRANDT work the same way,"" investigator Richard Fishel told Reuters. ""In this case, each patient has a unique combination of letters that allows for their simplified identification. With ten Next Generation sequencing machines, REMBRANDT can test every Ohio resident for COVID-19 infection every 10 days - an important step in contact tracing and reducing the spread of infection."" His team's report, published on Sunday on the preprint server bioRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed. ""Our next step,"" Fishel said, ""will be to collaborate with hospitals and public health departments to clinically validate REMBRANDT and make it available to a wider audience."" (bit.ly/2Ax26mT)

England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam has become a favourite on social media during the pandemic due to his colourful turn of phrase, including his insistence on Saturday that the public must not “tear the pants” out of new, slightly looser guidelines. 
Asked at a daily news conference whether people in authority should set an example and obey the rules, he willingly addressed the issue in contrast to his boss and the country’s chief scientific officer, who did not comment on the matter at a previous briefing. 
“Thank you for the question and I’m quite happy to answer it,” he said. 
“In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion, they are for the benefit of all and in my opinion they apply to all.” 
Cummings, the campaigner who helped deliver the 2016 Brexit referendum win and Boris Johnson’s 2019 election landslide, has been fighting to keep his job this week after his long road trip at the height of the lockdown provoked outrage across Britain. 
Cummings has refused to apologise for the trip, involving a 400 km (250 mile) trip to his parents’ property in northern England and another trip to a local castle that he said he took to test his eyes and driving ability after falling ill. 
The local police force said he may have breached lockdown rules with the shorter drive but said they would take no further action. Johnson has said he accepts the explanation and believes the matter is now closed.

The Pacific Business Group on Health, whose members include Boeing, Salesforce, Tesla, and Walmart, said in a letter addressed to congressional leaders this week that it feared that further consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to higher costs. 
Physician practices’ revenues have plummeted across the United States since shutdowns were imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as patients stay home except for emergencies. 
Even before the pandemic, well-funded hospital systems were taking over smaller doctors groups and hospitals to increase market share. 
PBGH said it fears these larger players will be even better positioned to buy struggling practices coming out of the crisis, raising healthcare prices for employers. The group asked for a year-long M&amp;A ban for any healthcare provider receiving any of the $170 billion government relief approved for the industry. 
“Anti-competitive practices are increasingly concerning to large employers. What we’re seeing happening right now is the collapse of independent primary care,” Elizabeth Mitchell, chief executive officer of PBGH, told Reuters.Politicians and regulators have already been scrutinizing mergers in the hospital industry. 
The Federal Trade Commission moved to block a merger between two Pennsylvania hospitals in February, on the grounds that consolidation would mean the systems would have fewer incentives to keep costs down.

Threats of spreading COVID-19 have occurred from coast to coast, raising questions about whether states will move to criminalize the weaponization of the novel coronavirus, the way more than half of U.S. states made undisclosed HIV exposure a crime when the AIDS crisis erupted in the 1980s. 
A Michigan man wiped his nose and face on the shirt of a store employee who was trying to enforce a mask-wearing requirement. The 68-year-old man was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery and, if convicted, faces three months behind bars and a $500 fine. 
In St. Petersburg, Florida, a man coughed and spit on police and threatened to spread the virus as they responded to domestic violence calls to his home. He faces up to five years in prison on federal charges of perpetrating a biological weapons hoax after his test results came back negative. 
A San Antonio, Texas, man claimed in a Facebook post that he paid someone to spread coronavirus at grocery stores. While his threat was deemed false, he too was arrested and charged with a biological weapons hoax. He claimed he was trying to deter people from visiting stores in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, federal prosecutors in Texas said. 
New Jersey is among the first states to consider making it a crime to issue a “credible threat to infect another with COVID-19 or similar infectious disease that triggered public emergency,” said a spokesman for the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Advocates for HIV-positive people said states drafting such laws should be careful not to make them so broad that they punish poor and minority communities, as studies show HIV criminalization has, according to the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law. 
Over the last four decades, at least 26 states passed laws to criminalize HIV exposure. Crimes range from biting to donating blood, and in most cases no HIV infection is required for a person to be charged with “criminal transmission of HIV.” 
Several studies have found HIV criminalization laws targeted minorities, said Brad Sears, associate dean of Public Interest Law at UCLA Law School. Those laws were created in response to a negative stereotype of “a predatory gay or bisexual man,” he said. 
Criminalization of COVID-19, on the other hand, is not gaining immediate momentum because it primarily affects the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, Sears said. 
But, he said, as the pandemic is increasingly concentrated in poor Americans and people of color, that could change states’ appetites for criminalization efforts. 
“That could increase the risk that state legislatures pass criminal laws to kind of scapegoat the very people who need to be protected,” Sears said. 
In New Jersey, Republican Senator Kristin Corrado’s bill to punish anyone convicted of threatening to spread COVID-19 with up to 10 years behind bars and a $150,000 fine was before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee this week. 
“To those who think it is cheeky to pull a sick prank like this - you will suffer the consequences of your poor decisions,” Corrado said in a statement. 
“These threats will not be taken lightly, and those found guilty will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.”

The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy’s health, will follow news last Friday of a surprise 2.5 million increase in nonfarm payrolls in May. It could reinforce views that the labor market has weathered the worst of the turbulence. 
The Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday it would provide years of extraordinary support for the economy, with policymakers projecting a 9.3% unemployment rate at year end. The unemployment rate has jumped from 3.5% in February and was at 13.3% in May. 
“The steady retreat in claims is a positive development, but the labor market has suffered a traumatic blow and a full recovery will be measured in years, not weeks or months,” said 
Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “The figures don’t capture the full extent of the blow dealt to workers during this unique crisis.” 
New applications for state unemployment benefits likely totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.55 million for the week ended June 6, down from 1.877 million the prior week, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would pull initial claims further away from a record 6.867 million in late March. 
But claims for jobless benefits would still be more than double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
Many businesses have reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. However, claims remain elevated amid jobs cuts outside the consumer sector, among industries that were not initially hit by the shutdown. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday there would an “extended period” during which it would be “difficult for many people to find work.” 
DISTORTED PICTURE 
Initial claims are recorded when a person submits a first application for unemployment benefits. Once approved they become continuing claims and are reported with a one-week lag. 
The report on Thursday is expected to show continuing claims slipped to 20 million in the week ending May 30 from 21.487 million in the prior week. Continuing claims have eased from a record high of 24.912 million in early May. 
That decline has been attributed to the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, that offers businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee salaries. 
“We are seeing the labor market high on PPP money,” said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “Once it runs out we might see a significant increase in layoffs again.” 
Economists caution that neither initial nor continuing claims give an accurate picture.

The government has expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include gig workers, the self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the pandemic. These workers do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance and must file claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. 
Though PUA are filed weekly, they are not included in the initial and continuing claims count. Roughly 36 states are processing PUA claims. Economists recommend focusing on benefit recipients for all programs, which totaled 30 million in the week ending May 16. 
“The labor market will continue to be under duress as businesses adapt to an economy running well below capacity, resulting in elevated layoffs,” said Alex Lin, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research in New York.

The new trial found no serious side effects or heart problems from use of hydroxychloroquine. 
Vocal support from Trump kicked off a heated debate and raised expectations for the decades-old drug that could be a cheap and widely available tool in fighting the pandemic that has infected more than 6.4 million people and killed over 382,000 worldwide 
In the first major study comparing hydroxychloroquine to a placebo to gauge its effect against the new coronavirus, University of Minnesota researchers tested 821 people who had recently been exposed to the virus or lived in a high-risk household. 
It found 11.8% of subjects given hydroxychloroquine developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19, compared with 14.3%who got a placebo. That difference was not statistically significant, meaning the drug was no better than placebo. 
“Our data is pretty clear that for post exposure, this does not really work,” said Dr. David Boulware, the trial’s lead researcher and an infectious disease physician at the University of Minnesota. 
Several trials of the drug have been stopped over concerns about its safety for treating COVID-19 patients raised by health regulators and previous less rigorous studies and. 
“I think both sides - one side who is saying ‘this is a dangerous drug’ and the other side that says ‘this works’ - neither is correct,” said Boulware. 
The results were expected to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine” with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Hydroxychloroquine - which has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties - inhibited the virus in laboratory experiments. But these type of human trials are needed to definitively demonstrate whether the drug’s benefits, if any, outweigh the risks when compared with a placebo. 
Proponents of the drug as a COVID-19 treatment argue it may need to be administered at an earlier stage in the disease to be effective. Others have suggested that it needs to be used in combination with the mineral zinc, which can help boost the immune system. 
More than 20% of the trial subjects also took zinc, which had no significant effect. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautioned in late April against the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with heart disease due to an increased risk of dangerous cardiac rhythm problems. 
Boulware said his trial had fewer participants than initially planned because of difficulty enrolling new subjects after the FDA’s warning. 
On Tuesday, the British medical journal the Lancet said it had concerns about data behind an influential article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients, a conclusion that undercut scientific interest in the medicine. [nL1N2DF1W1] 
Boulware was one of the signatories of an open letter from doctors that called attention to potential problems with that study. 
Some European governments banned hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, and U.S. hospitals have significantly cut back its use. [nL8N2D92TE] [nL1N2DB16J] 
In the University of Minnesota trial, 40% of the those who took hydroxychloroquine reported less serious side effects like nausea and abdominal discomfort versus 17% in the placebo group. 
Results of another University of Minnesota placebo-controlled trial testing hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment rather than to prevent infection is expected soon.

Severe cases of COVID-19 are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system, known as a cytokine storm, and researchers are investigating whether drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation of symptoms. 
Izana Bioscience’s Namilumab, a monoclonal antibody already in late-stage tests to treat rheumatoid arthritis and an inflammatory disease called ankylosing spondylitis, is the first of four candidates in the CATALYST trial. 
It targets a cytokine called GM-CSF, which in uncontrolled levels is believed to be a key driver of the excessive and dangerous lung inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients. 
The drug is already being tested as a COVID-19 therapy in Italy. 
The second drug, Infliximab (CT-P13), developed by Slough-based Celltrion Healthcare UK, is an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. It is used to treat eight autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. 
Ben Fisher, trial co-clinical investigator from the University of Birmingham, said: “Emerging evidence is demonstrating a critical role for anti-inflammatory drugs in the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 infection. 
“In the CATALYST study we hope to show with a single dose of these kinds of drugs in hospitalised patients that we are able to delay or prevent the rapid deterioration into intensive care and requirement for invasive ventilation in this critical patient group.” 
Other autoimmune disease drugs that are being tested for their ability to quell the cytokine storm in trials include Regeneron and Sanofi’s Kevzara, Roche’s Actemra as well as Morphosys and GlaxoSmithKline’s otilimab.

Last week proved a marker in that dollar shock as U.S. Federal Reserve data showed falling demand for the emergency liquidity lines it had speedily opened up to the world at the end of March - prompting the Fed’s major central bank peers to reduce the frequency of their operations. 
Emerging markets, at the sharp end of that funding scramble due to outsize government and corporate borrowing in dollars, stand to benefit considerably from the waning tension. 
The space created by the Fed, as well as moves by many emerging central banks to both slash interest rates on a record scale and buy local bonds in unprecedented quantitative easing (QE) manoeuvres, has seen financial conditions ease at last. 
After an historically sharp “sudden stop” in financing in March, when record capital outflows from emerging stocks and bonds of $83 billion were recorded by the Institute for International Finance, there’s since been a bounce. 
So much so, the yield on JP Morgan’s local currency sovereign bond index has dropped more than a full percentage point to an historic low of 4.8% - showing nominal borrowing rates for emerging governments cheaper than they’ve ever been. 
Meanwhile a measure of net policy moves show more easing across the emerging universe than even during the financial crash 12 years ago, further underlining the leeway to loosen conditions without adverse effects. 
This week alone, for example, Hungary’s central bank surprised forecasters with another rate cut on Tuesday, and Mexico and Turkey are likely to follow suit later in the week. 
Emerging market currencies - unlike during other episodes of rapid monetary loosening - continue to hold up remarkably well. 
A paper by the Bank for International Settlements this month remarked how concerns about using QE in inflation-prone and foreign capital dependent emerging markets have so far proved unfounded and instead “provided useful support” in a shock. 
“Market reactions do not suggest that the launch of the new measures gave rise to perceived risks of fiscal dominance or large-scale monetary easing,” the BIS paper said, adding market belief in the time-limited nature of the forays could be seen in how little currencies fell or bond yields rose afterwards. 
TROUBLE AHEAD? 
The resilience and easier funding is a relief, but many experts are worried about what is to come. 
The pandemic is proving hard to tamp down in countries with weaker health systems and more limited finances. Even though far from the poorest, Brazil’s struggle to contain COVID-19 is a case in the point, and it’s now second only to the United States in both cases and deaths. 
Then there’s a growing concern that the legacy of the pandemic will be to accelerate pre-pandemic trends in protectionism and de-globalisation, which the developing world stands to lose from. 
The potential damage to trade growth and diverse supply chains across emerging economies adds to the hit to the poorest nations from any shrinking of gigantic remittance flows. 
The Pew Research Centre, using World Bank, Oxford University and Google data, estimates that this year’s lockdowns will cut global remittance flows by a record 20% this year - or by more than $140 billion. 
Even though the “emerging markets” grouping disguises very different national stories and trends, the asset class as a whole has persistently underperformed developed markets for almost a decade. 
Investment managers reasonably make cases for specific countries or hard currency bonds in EM or for currencies of more fiscally sound or reserve-rich countries with positive real interest rates. JP Morgan’s multi-asset team eyes Mexico, Russia and China in that regard. 
But while easier financing should bring recovery, longer-lasting shifts in the global economy and politics may keep investors wary of emerging markets for some time and ensure they remain laggards for longer.

Representatives of EU states and the European Parliament cited “adverse circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic”, a statement from the Council of EU states said. 
The rules would allow market participants to choose where they want to clear their listed derivatives trades, pitting clearers like the London Stock Exchange’s (LSE.L) LCH, Deutsche Boerse’s (DB1Gn.DE) Eurex, and ICE (ICE.N) against each other. 
The rules, part of the EU’s MiFID II securities law, were due to come into force on July 4 and will now be delayed a year until July 4, 2021. 
They were controversial in the making, with lawmakers’ concerns over the potential impact on financial stability disputed by proponents of greater competition in markets. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority said on June 11 that market disruption from COVID-19 could increase operational risks by limiting the capacity of clearers to assess access requests and manage the migration of transactions. 
Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said it backed ESMA’s stance. 
Clearing houses ensure a securities transaction is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust.

Golfweek, which spoke to Koepka, said the four-times major champion, his caddie and coach all went for additional testing after playing a practice round with Graeme McDowell, who also withdrew after his caddie returned a positive test. 
“I’m going to pull out to protect everybody else. I think it’s the right thing to do,” American Koepka said. “I don’t want to risk anyone’s life if they have respiratory issues or underlying conditions. The only way this Tour can continue is if guys do this sort of thing and be proactive about it.” 
The PGA Tour would not confirm Koepka’s withdrawal from the Travelers Championship but said it will issue a statement later on Wednesday. 
Golfweek said Northern Irishman McDowell’s caddie is isolating in Florida and had not travelled to Connecticut for the tournament. 
The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is the third of five events on the PGA Tour’s revamped schedule which is closed to the public in a bid to help stem the spread of the virus. 
American Nick Watney last week tested positive for the virus, forcing him to withdraw ahead of second-round action in South Carolina.

Both Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s give Canada a triple-A rating. 
Canada would run a much expanded general government deficit of 16.1% of GDP in 2020 and emerge from recession with much higher public debt ratios, Fitch said. 
The ratings agency expects the coronavirus response to raise Canada’s consolidated gross general government debt to 115.1% of GDP in 2020, up from 88.3% of GDP in 2019. 
Ottawa is rolling out more than C$150 billion in direct aid to support the economy. 
“A worse case scenario for Canadians and the economy would have been to not act,” said Finance Minister Bill Morneau in a statement to Reuters. 
Financial market reaction was muted, with the Canadian dollar slightly extending its decline to 1.3617 to the U.S. dollar, or 73.44 U.S. cents, while Canada’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.545%. 
“Canada is still a very strong credit in a relative sense,” said Derek Holt, vice President of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. “Ratings are just not a major market driver in relation to all other influences upon bond markets and such actions often lag developments that markets have already digested.”

To limit the temperature rise to safe levels, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions need to be reduced to net zero by 2050. Shipping and aviation accounted for around 5% of all emissions before the COVID-19 outbreak and are expected to contribute 40% by 2050. 
Climate Action Tracker, a collaboration between German-based Climate Analytics and the New Climate Institute, measures government action against a globally agreed aim to limit warming to safe levels. 
Climate Action Tracker said trade and maritime passenger transport have slowed as lockdowns to spread the novel coronavirus limited movement. The sector’s emissions could drop by 18-35% this year from 2019, it said, but by 2030, shipping emissions’ growth could return to pre-COVID levels. 
The report said the shipping industry was already likely to exeed its own 2030 climate target and its emissions are expected to soar above its 2050 goal. 
The study also said ships powered by liquefied natural gas would not support a transition to zero CO2 emissions and could increase the sector’s climate impact when the full life-cycle, including super-cooling the gas for shipment, is taken into account. 
“There is tremendous potential for the international shipping industry to decarbonise completely and reach zero emissions by 2050, yet there is very little sign of this sector is moving anywhere near fast enough,” Bill Hare at Climate Analytics said. 
As air travel has shrunk because of pandemic lockdowns, aviation CO2 emissions are likely to be 45%-60% lower this year than in 2019, the report said. 
However, emissions are forecast to double or even triple over the 2015-2050 period and this year’s deceline does not alter that trajectory. (Reporting by Nina Chestney; editing by Barbara Lewis)"

The guidance document said “work self-isolation” outside of healthcare settings would be allowed for asymptomatic employees “deemed critical to operations” at local public health workers’ discretion and that employers would be responsible for ensuring they do not put others at risk. 
The province is battling outbreaks that have killed three migrant farmworkers, and has started mass-testing asymptomatic farmworkers. The change could send some of them back to their jobs. 
It was prompted by a cluster of farmworkers who tested positive but were all asymptomatic, said Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams. 
“As we learn more, we change things, we adapt,” he told a briefing in Toronto. 
Experts and officials have said that people who are not showing symptoms can spread the virus. 
Keith Currie, president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, said employers would have to separate positive workers, or if that is not possible, tell them not to work. 
Currie said anyone who did not feel comfortable working would not have to do so, and would be eligible for workers’ compensation. 
Susana Caxaj, a nursing professor and a coordinator of the Migrant Worker Health Expert Working Group, said assuming that asymptomatic workers would not spread the virus was “wishful thinking.” 
Farmworkers often do hard physical labor for long hours. 
“They’re pushing their body to the limit,” she said. “If a person is actually not asymptomatic but pre-symptomatic, we could be putting that person at greater risk.”

Monahan, who was not originally listed on the interview schedule ahead of the Travelers, announced new safety measures and reiterated existing ones. 
“All of us have an extraordinary responsibility to follow those protocols. For any individual that does not, there will be serious repercussions, and I’m not going to get into the specifics of it,” Monahan said from TPC River Highlands, site of this week’s Travelers Championship. 
“But everybody knows and needs to know that our future, our ability to sustain this business and to impact the communities where we play and to create so many jobs is contingent on our ability to follow those protocols.” 
Monahan delivered his remarks a day after a second PGA Tour player in a five-day span tested positive for COVID-19. 
In the three weeks since the PGA Tour returned from its COVID-19 hiatus, Monahan said there have been seven positive results from 2,757 total in-market tournament tests across the main circuit and developmental Korn Ferry Tour. 
“It’s a low number, but every number hurts,” Monahan said. 
Monahan said major champions Brooks Koepka and Graeme McDowell have withdrawn from this week’s event “out of an abundance of caution” after their caddies tested positive. 
World number five Webb Simpson also withdrew after a family member tested positive while Koepka’s younger brother Chase decided to sit out because he played a practice round with Brooks and McDowell. 
Among changes announced by Monahan are further testing, player instructors being added to the testing bubble and an onsite fitness trailer to deter golfers from using outside gyms. 
Monahan said he has confidence in the protocols in place and remains hopeful the PGA Tour’s schedule will not be interrupted.

A record number of new illnesses in Texas this week spurred local officials to impose restrictions as new cases topped 5,000 on two days in a row. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds were 97% full at Houston’s Texas Medical Center, which said it may soon move to surge ICU capacity assignments, officials said. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has led a phased reopening of shops, bars and amusement parks from May 1, and businesses have rolled out their own office restarts. But on Wednesday, he warned of a “massive outbreak” and urged people to stay at home. 
Many energy firms qualify as essential, and therefore are free to staff normally, but the surge in illness and hospitalizations has large employers delaying or halting openings. 
Halliburton Co, the second-largest U.S. oilfield service company by revenue, delayed for two weeks a second-phase of its return-to-work plan, a spokeswoman said. 
Chevron also has delayed its reopening plans for further evaluation, said spokesman Sean Comey. About 5% of its Houston office staff and about 2% of its San Ramon, California, workforce are in their offices now, he said. 
Midcoast Energy, a natural gas pipeline company, reopened on June 1 then sent Houston employees home three weeks later after two tested positive for the virus, according to a person familiar with the matter. President Robert Bond did not reply to requests for comment. 
Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips returned some white-collar workers to their campuses in May or this month. Exxon will remain below 50% capacity at its Houston-area facility, a spokesman said. Conoco is prepared to change its return-to-office plan if needed, a spokesman said.

Clinical trials are underway for more than a dozen potential vaccines, including at least six in China, but Japan’s first human trials are expected to start next month. 
In development of treatments, Russia and India approved Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s (4901.T) Avigan as a COVID-19 therapy, but Japan, whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has touted the drug’s potential and hoped to approve it in May, won’t see a decision until at least July. 
“Due to the decreasing number of coronavirus infections, we believe it will take some time before clinical research is completed,” said Tetsuya Nakamura, who is running a trial of Avigan at Gunma University Hospital in central Japan. 
“It’s a pity that Avigan has been approved overseas but not in Japan.” 
Japan has fared better than most developed nations in tackling the disease that has killed more than 470,000 worldwide. While the epidemic drove Japan’s medical system to the brink of collapse in recent months, serious cases now number about 60 nationwide. 
Some 54 COVID-19 related clinical trials have been launched in Japan, but most are still in the patient recruitment phase, according to trials’ tracking data. 
Interest in Avigan, known generically as favipiravir, soared in March after a Chinese official said it appeared to help patients recover from COVID-19. It is now the subject of at least 25 clinical trials around the world. 
The regulatory delay on Avigan is partly due to the fact that the studies should have been carried out in multiple countries at once, said Dr. Nakamura. But such studies are “enormously expensive.” 
Fujifilm said it is working to complete the clinical trials “as soon as possible.” 
Japanese biotech firm Healios KK (4593.T) said in April it intended to add COVID-19 patients to its experimental lung therapy trial but has not enlisted any as yet. 
“We were careful to size the cohort in light of the low number of patients in Japan, and so are only seeking to enroll around five patients,” CFO Richard Kincaid said. 
With a dearth of domestic patients, Japan may have to rely more on overseas data and results to aid in regulatory approvals. That practice is common “if the quality of data is considered to be good enough,” according to health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara. 
Sahara did not comment on the Russia or Indian approvals of Avigan and whether data from those nations could be used in Japan. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Japan’s primary drug regulator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Testing to find the virus before patients spread it further is key to controlling the pandemic, especially as lockdowns lift. The Arizona delays - in testing and results reporting - are similar to problems seen earlier in the epidemic, and some labs across the country are facing shortages of supplies, an industry group said. 
In Arizona, Roche Holding (ROG.S) recently told Sonora Quest lab, a joint venture between Phoenix-based Banner Health and Quest Diagnostics (DGX.N), that a new instrument it had hoped to get in June would not be delivered until August, said Sonora Chief Operating Officer Sonya Engle. 
“The testing demand has increased significantly,” said Engle, whose lab is responsible for approximately 80% of Arizona COVID-19 tests. “We have reached record highs each day in the past couple weeks.” 
On Friday, she said, the lab received a record 12,000 test orders, double its capacity. It is aiming to ramp up to 17,000 a day but is still working on a deal with a new supplier to make that possible. 
Roche said in response to a request from Reuters that it has been ramping up production since March and is committed to delivering as many tests as possible to the most affected areas, including Arizona. 
“At the height of this global pandemic, demand for diagnostic tests and the instruments to conduct them continues to outstrip supply,” the company said on Tuesday in a statement. 
Last week the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, which represents clinical lab workers and researchers, wrote to Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, urging her to “use the authority of the federal government to obtain and allocate these vital supplies.” 
In a May survey of 100 labs, 50% said they continued to have difficulty getting the swabs, reagents or test kits they needed, according to the letter, which has not been published previously. 
The White House referred questions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which did not immediately respond. 
Arizona, Florida and Texas are all experiencing record surges in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis. Arizona reported 17,000 new cases last week, a 90% increase, with 20% of tests coming back positive. 
The major suppliers to U.S. labs, including Roche and Abbott (ABT.N), sell both lab equipment and proprietary chemicals called reagent kits that are specific to their equipment. When reagent runs low, labs generally cannot switch suppliers. 
In recent days, some free testing sites in Arizona have had to turn patients away because of rising demand, according to local media reports. The Arizona Republic reported that some people had waited as long as 13 hours at one site in Phoenix on Saturday. 
Engle said patients have waited five to six days for results, up from two to three days in May.

In a statement the Croatian Public Health Institute said Plenkovic did not have to self-isolate as the risk of infection was low because he only briefly met Djokovic and was not in a close contact with him. 
Three other players who played in Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region have also tested positive. 
Plenkovic attended the tournament in the northern Adriatic town of Zadar on Saturday, a day before it was cancelled after Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria said he tested positive for the novel coronavirus. 
Croatia’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also tested positive as well as Djokovic’s fitness coach Marco Panichi and Dimitrov’s coach Christian Groh. 
On Monday, Plenkovic tested negative for COVID-19 but calls from opposition politicians for him to self-isolate grew stronger on Tuesday after Djokovic, whom he had met briefly, tested positive. 
Plenkovic, who was on an election campaign trip in the town of Zapresic handshaking and hugging his fans, said he was not worried because his meeting with Djokovic lasted about three minutes and could not be described as a close contact. 
“Under the definition of close contact this was not the close contact and everything is normal,” Plenkovic told reporters. 
A video showed him talking to Djokovic in the closed court and patting his shoulder. 
Plenkovic said opposition politicians wanted him in isolation to avoid the confrontation with him in television debates ahead of the July 5 parliamentary election.

The 27-nation bloc is eager to restart tourism, which has taken a massive hit during the coronavirus pandemic, but fears of second spikes have so far only allowed for partial and patchy reopening of borders with multiple health and security curbs. 
Draft recommendations from the EU’s current presidency Croatia, seen by Reuters, suggest allowing non-EU nationals in from countries with stable or decreasing infections, and those with a “comparable or better epidemiological situation” than Europe. 
That epidemiological criteria is defined as between 16-20 new cases of infection reported over 14 days per 100,000 people. 
Nations would also be assessed for their records on testing, contact-tracing and treatment, reliability of data, and reciprocal travel arrangements for EU residents, according to the document, to be debated by envoys in Brussels on Wednesday. 
Based on the latest update by the bloc's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), here the proposed methodology could rule out travellers from the United States and Mexico, most of South America, South Africa, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, among others. 
The United States, where President Donald Trump banned European visitors at the start of the crisis, has by far the highest number of deaths and cases in the world. [nL4N2AY3AS] 
EU diplomats stressed, however, that the travel criteria could still change and that the recommendations will be non-binding. 
“It seems there is a lot of wishful thinking in these recommendations. They are also causing much controversy. July 1 may slip and many countries may go their own way in any case,” a diplomat said of the proposal by the European Commission. 
The proposal, aimed at promoting a coordinated approach, would cover Europe’s Schengen zone of normally-invisible borders that brings together most EU states as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein. 
A major achievement of post-World War Two European integration, it has suffered a major setback in recent months as countries brought back border controls to contain the virus.

By Shreyashi Sanyal 
June 24 (Reuters) - Stocks in the developing world touched a 16-week high on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous session as investors remained positive about a return to growth with the re-opening of global economies even as COVID-19 cases increased. 
The MSCI’s index for emerging markets stocks rose 0.1%, while its counterpart index for currencies was flat. 
Optimism about the global economy was supported by encouraging manufacturing data from Europe, with France standing out as loosening lockdown measures there led to a slight return to growth. 
“The loosening of lockdown restrictions has helped economies recover from their respective self-induced comas,” said David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 
“But recovery in economic activity comes at a cost and that is why there have been increases in COVID-19 cases in several countries such as China, Germany, India, Brazil and the United States.” 
There was some caution in markets, which have assumed a very high bar for fully shutting down economies again, as gold prices jumped and more money chased the U.S. dollar. 
In emerging market FX, the South African rand slipped 0.4% ahead of a widely anticipated COVID-19 budget speech by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. The budget speech is due at 1300 GMT. 
The special budget, brought forward by the treasury in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 500 billion rand ($29 billion) stimulus package, is expected to show ballooning deficit and debt in Africa’s most industrialized economy. 
“I urge caution in the rand,” Antje Praefcke FX and emerging markets analyst at Commerzbank wrote in a client note. 
“The presentation of the revised emergency budget by Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni is likely to illustrate very clearly today that money is running out left, right and centre.” 
Currencies of countries in eastern and central Europe, including Hungary and the Czech Republic edged lower against the euro. 
The Russian rouble edged lower but held at near two-week highs against the dollar. Stock markets in Russia were closed on Wednesday as President Vladimir Putin declared a public holiday to hold a military parade that was cancelled last month due to the new coronavirus outbreak.

Cheese parent CEC Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday, making it the latest casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic that has crushed entertainment and leisure industries globally. 
The company described the current crisis as the “most challenging” in its history and said it would use the bankruptcy proceedings to continue talks with stakeholders and landlords, as well as restructure its balance sheet. 
CEC listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to the bankruptcy filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. 
U.S. and international franchise partners as well as corporate entities outside the United States are not part of the process, it said. 
Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza locations will continue to re-open as per government guidelines, CEC added. 
As of Wednesday, 266 Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza restaurant and arcade venues were re-opened, with the company expecting to maintain ongoing operations in the locations throughout the Chapter 11 process. 
Irving, Texas-based CEC was taken private by Apollo Global Management in 2014 in a $1.3 billion deal, including debt. 
It has since sought to broaden its appeal beyond children and teenagers, expanding its alcohol offerings for adults. 
Last year, the company terminated its earlier decision to merge with Leo Holdings, a blank check company. 
As of March, CEC and its franchisees operated 612 Chuck E. Cheese and 122 Peter Piper Pizza venues, with locations in 47 U.S. states and 16 foreign countries. 
PJT Partners is serving as a financial adviser, while FTI Consulting is its restructuring adviser, it said.

The 26-year-old American has been crushing balls after adding muscle during the PGA Tour’s three-month break and has been knocking on the door of a win since the restart with top 10 finishes at Colonial and at Harbour Town last week. 
“I think this golf course suits me a little bit better,” he told reporters ahead of the opening round of the Travelers Championship. 
“I can use the length to my advantage on the front nine and there’s a couple of holes on the back nine I can do the same,” he said. 
“I definitely feel like I can let it go a lot more.” 
DeChambeau will benefit from a field that saw major champions Brooks Koepka and Graeme McDowell withdraw on Wednesday after their caddies both tested positive for COVID-19. 
Hard-hitting Cameron Champ withdrew earlier in the week after he became the second PGA Tour golfer to test positive for the virus, and last week’s winner Webb Simpson said he would sit the tournament out after a family member tested positive. 
In response the PGA Tour on Wednesday said stricter safety measures would be put in place. 
The thinning of the still-impressive field could clear the way for DeChambeau, who added 25 pounds during the break and has his sights set on winning his first major title this year. 
“I knew that if I could start working out my body every single day, I’d be better the next day, and other people would be behind,” he said. 
“I thought that if I could do that every single day through quarantine, I’d come back a different person, and I did, and I hope that it’s given me an edge.”

The United States Tennis Association’s announcement comes five days after the national governing body said it was rethinking their decision and that it could have better communicated with wheelchair athletes. 
“The decision was made following multiple virtual meetings with a group of wheelchair athletes and the International Tennis Federation over the last week,” the USTA said in a statement. 
“The 2020 U.S. Open Wheelchair Competition will feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles and quad singles and doubles, with draw sizes similar to past U.S. Opens.” 
Australian Paralympic tennis champion Dylan Alcott, who led the player backlash and had described the exclusion as “disgusting discrimination”, thanked organisers for reversing the decision. 
“I was in tears (when the event was excluded),” the twice U.S. Open champion said on Australia’s Channel Nine. 
“It was just because it was so hard sometimes, growing up with a disability, where able-bodied people decide which restaurant you go in to, which school you go in to, which tennis tournaments you can play. 
“It’s a huge turning point to show how supportive a community can be and from the bottom of my heart, I can’t say thanks enough.” 
The changes at this year’s U.S. Open in New York include no spectators, reducing the number of teams in the men’s and women’s doubles events by half, and the elimination of the mixed doubles and juniors competitions.

Thanks to an aggressive, targeted testing programme and a centralised quarantine system, Vietnam has contained infections numbers to a relatively low 352 cases, most of whom have recovered. There have been no reported deaths. 
“There is no story of rushing to open the doors,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in a statement posted to the government website on Wednesday. 
“Vietnam is not yet ready to welcome back international tourists. Foreign experts, high level workers and investors into Vietnam are welcomed but will be closely monitored.” 
Highly skilled foreign experts such as engineers have been allowed to enter Vietnam on special flights and quarantine at hotels in a bid to keep the economy afloat throughout the global pandemic. Phuc said the frequency of such flights should be increased. 
For over two months, Vietnam has reported no community transmission of the coronavirus. In early June, Vietnam said it was planning to resume flights to some virus-free countries that had registered no cases of coronavirus for 30 days or more. 
Other Southeast Asian countries with slowing infections are considering travel bubble arrangements in the months ahead, such as Malaysia and Thailand, to include countries such as China, South Korea and Japan. 
Thailand has been 31 days without a domestic transmission and will allow entry of some short-term business travellers and medical tourists from next month.

The plan would see 22 of the NBA’s 30 teams play eight seeding games to determine a 16-team playoff field that would follow the traditional post-season format with four best-of-seven series that would crown a champion no later than Oct. 12. 
The NBA was the first North American sports league to suspend its season after one of its players tested positive in mid-March with five weeks left in the 82-game regular season.

The Canadian pot producer said it has cut its selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) workforce by 25% and will lay off 30% of its production staff over the next two quarters. 
A slow roll out of retail stores, the prevalence of illicit markets and burgeoning supply from producers racing to assert dominance have led to steep price declines and unsold pot stacking up. 
Aurora said it expects SG&amp;A expenses to be around C$42 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with C$75.1 million, excluding severance costs, recorded in the third quarter. 
It also expects production asset impairment charges of up to C$60 million in the fourth quarter.

Djokovic was criticised for hosting the tournament amid a pandemic after Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also returned positive tests after playing in the tournament that was held in Serbia and Croatia. 
Following is a list of quotes from the 17-times Grand Slam champion on tennis, the pandemic, vaccines and more: 
Djokovic on testing positive for COVID-19 (June 23): 
“The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as (wife) Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative. 
“I’m extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and that everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days.” 
Djokovic on mandatory coronavirus vaccinations (April 19): 
“Personally I’m opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel. 
“But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I’ll have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.” 
Djokovic on the power of positive emotions (May 6): 
“This is something that is not linked to any form of official way of presenting nutrition and how you should eat and drink. 
“I know some people that, through energetic transformation, through the power of prayer, through the power of gratitude, they managed to turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water. 
“Scientists have proven that in (an) experiment, that molecules in the water react to our emotions to what has been said.” 
Djokovic on the U.S. Open’s strict protocols (June 6): 
“The rules that they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme. We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week. 
“Also, we could bring one person to the club which is really impossible. I mean, you need your coach, then a fitness trainer, then a physiotherapist.” 
Djokovic on staging an exhibition tournament in Serbia amid the pandemic (June 12): 
“We have different circumstances and measures (to other countries) so it’s very difficult to think of international standards (regarding the pandemic). 
“We’ve had better numbers compared to some other countries. Of course, lives have been lost and that’s horrible to see, in the region and worldwide. But life goes on and we as athletes are looking forward to competing. 
“You can also criticise us and say this is maybe dangerous but it’s not up to me to make the calls what is right or wrong health-wise. We are doing what the Serbian government is telling us and hopefully we soon will get back on tour collectively.” 
Djokovic on the prospect of the U.S. Open going ahead and the ATP Tour’s resumption (June 18): 
“Hopefully every single player who is participating, chosen by ranking and who deserves their place at the U.S. Open, will have an equal opportunity to travel there and compete as everybody else. 
“I’m extremely happy and excited to see that all the tournaments, especially Grand Slams, are organising their events. 
“I think that a lot of people were sceptical, especially for the U.S. events considering what the U.S. went through as a country during this pandemic. So a lot of people, including myself, were quite sceptical on whether it would happen or not.”

The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index climbed to 61.6 in June from 52.3 in May, but remains some distance from February’s pre-pandemic reading of 85.2. In April the index dropped to 42.6 in the sharpest month-on-month decline in the survey’s 24-year history. 
The recovery in consumer sentiment mirrors gains in similar indicators for the United States, euro zone and Britain, and suggests the easing of lockdown measures is making consumers feel slightly less negative about the economic outlook, the index compilers said. 
“There was a significant improvement in expectations for household finances a year from now but, again, this needs to be seen in context,” said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Ireland. “Only one in 20 consumers envisages better financial circumstances through the next 12 months whereas one in three expects a deterioration.” 
Ireland in March shut bars, restaurants and non-essential retail outlets and ordered people to stay at home, but has announced plans to accelerate the reopening of its economy as the rate of COVID-19 infections falls. 
Hughes said that fading fears should support stronger spending, but warned that “the cautious tone of responses to 
questions on personal finances suggests a still fearful and, in many instances, financially damaged Irish consumer”.

But a resurgence in confirmed coronavirus cases across the country threatens the nascent signs of improvement evident in Tuesday’s economic data. Many states have reported record daily increases in COVID-19 infections, which health experts have blamed on local governments reopening their economies too soon. The economy has stabilized as businesses reopened after closing in mid-March to control the spread of the respiratory illness. 
“The renewed upsurge in COVID-19 cases across the South and the West poses a clear downside risk over the coming months but, with a second wave of state-wide lockdowns appearing unlikely for now, we are assuming this will act as a modest drag on the economic recovery, rather than resulting in a renewed downturn,” said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. 
New home sales jumped 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. Last month’s increase left sales just shy of their pre-COVID-19 level. 
Sales dropped 5.2% in April to a pace of 580,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14.7% of housing market sales, rising 2.9% to a pace of 640,000 in May. 
New home sales are drawn from building permits. Sales surged 12.7% from a year ago in May. The report followed on the heels of data last week showing home purchase applications at an 11-year high in mid-June and permits rebounding strongly in May. 
The broader economy slipped into recession in February, leaving nearly 20 million people unemployed as of May. 
In a separate report on Tuesday, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 46.8 in June from 37 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in private sector output. 
The improvement was led by an ebb in the manufacturing sector downturn, with the flash Purchasing Managers Index climbing to 49.6 from 39.8 in May. The survey’s services sector flash PMI rose to 46.7 from 37.5 in May. 
Activity is also picking up around the globe. The IHS Markit’s euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index recovered to 47.5 from May’s 31.9. 
Stocks on Wall Street extended gains on the data and hopes of more fiscal stimulus. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
UNEMPLOYMENT HURDLE 
The market for new homes is being supported by historic low interest rates and a preference among buyers for single-family homes away from city centers as companies allow employees more flexibility to work from home amid the coronavirus crisis. 
But with record unemployment and companies freezing hiring to deal with weak demand and keep costs under control, a sharp rebound in the housing market is unlikely. 
“If the overall economy seems to be slowing, the public may not be quite as confident about putting a down payment on an expensive new home,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Many businesses are insolvent and there will be less spending from unemployed Americans as well that could keep this economic recovery in the slow lane for some time.” 
Last month’s increase in new home sales did little to offset a plunge in sales of existing homes in April and May, leaving intact economists’ expectations for a record tumble in residential investment in the second quarter. Homebuilding also rebounded moderately in May after slumping in April. 
Last month, new home sales shot up 45.5% in the Northeast and advanced 29% in the West. They rose 15.2% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, but fell 6.4% in the Midwest. 
The median new house price rose 1.7% to $317,900 in May from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range. 
New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for about 15% of sales. 
There were 318,000 new homes on the market in May, down from 325,000 in April. At May’s sales pace it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.7 months in April. Nearly two-thirds of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The men’s world number one was the fourth player to contract the virus after Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Croatia’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki previously tested positive after playing in the Adria Tour event in the Balkan region. 
The tournament was among many events that have recently been held while professional tennis remains suspended due to the pandemic. 
But there was one key difference about Djokovic’s event. 
While the other tournaments were contested without any fans in attendance and those present adhered to social distancing rules, Djokovic’s Adria Tour attracted a capacity crowd in the Serbian capital, where players interacted, embraced and partied like they did in pre-COVID-19 days. 
“Djokovic shot himself in the foot by organising the Adria Tour,” Radmilo Armenulic, a former Yugoslavia Davis Cup coach, told Reuters by phone. 
“The organisation of the Belgrade leg was catastrophic, the stands were so full that fans were virtually sitting on top of each other. He staged this event with the best of intentions but it turns out it was a big mistake.” 
While the players hugged at the net, played basketball, posed for pictures and attended news conferences together, Djokovic also organised nights out in Belgrade and pictures and videos of him dancing with the players made it to social media. 
The players, however, did not break any government protocols in Serbia or Croatia with both countries easing lockdown measures weeks before the event. 
But it highlighted the risks of athletes from different countries being in close proximity to one another, which could be a concern for the men’s ATP and women’s WTA Tour when they resume the professional circuit in August after five months. 
The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has also announced plans for the U.S. Open Grand Slam to be held as scheduled from Aug. 31 in New York and governing bodies are expected to have strict protocols is place. 
“We have to be careful because we also have to be conscious that even with extreme measures, you could actually end up having some players testing positive,” ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi told the New York Times. 
BUBBLE 
During the U.S. Open, players and guests must wear masks when onsite unless practising or competing and testing will be conducted before travelling to the United States and at least once per week along with daily temperature checks. 
Top players, including Djokovic, have in recent times expressed their displeasure at the stringent measures, something that the ATP and the WTA are also expected to incorporate at their tournaments. 
Gaudenzi said he hoped players will be more receptive to restrictions following the Adria Tour fiasco. 
Stacey Allaster, the new U.S. Open tournament director, said organisers had to take a “leap of faith” regarding players’ willingness to follow the protocols. 
“If you think about it, we really designed this tournament around a bubble,” said Brian Hainline, the chief medical officer for the NCAA. 
“If someone becomes infected, that’s a possibility, if they go out and they put themselves at a behaviour where their behaviour is risky, they’re really taking on a responsibility of saying what I’m doing is not that important to my fellow players.” 
Armenulic, however, believes it will take the sport at least a year to go back to where it was before the pandemic and professional circuit should not resume before next year’s Australian Open. 
“Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality that we are still learning to cope and live with,” Djokovic, a 17-times Grand Slam singles champion, said. 
“I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. 
“I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm. We were wrong and it was too soon.”

Liverpool, who could potentially seal their first English league crown in 30 years against City next Thursday, are awaiting a decision from a safety advisory group on the venue. 
“Honestly, I would prefer it is at Manchester, otherwise it would be really difficult to organise it,” Klopp told reporters ahead of Wednesday’s league clash against Crystal Palace. 
Authorities could shift the game to a neutral venue due to concerns Liverpool fans might congregate outside the stadium to celebrate their success. 
“I don’t know how it would be but it would not be in Liverpool so it would mean we both have to go somewhere where we both need a hotel. That is the only issue,” Klopp added. 
“Apart from that we play where they send us to but I would prefer it in Manchester ... I’ll wait until the final information is confirmed whether it is Manchester or not. It would be a challenge for both clubs.”

Monique Vledder, head of secretariat at the bank’s Global Financing Facility (GFF), told Reuters in an interview the agency was gravely worried about the numbers of children missing vaccinations, women giving birth without medical help and interrupted supplies of life-saving medicines like antibiotics. 
“We’re very concerned about what’s happening - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,” Vledder said as she unveiled the results of a GFF survey, one of the first seeking to assess the impact of COVID-19 on women’s and children’s health. 
“Many of the countries we work in are fragile and so, by definition, already have very challenging situations when it comes to health service delivery. This is making things worse.” 
From late March, the GFF has conducted monthly surveys with local staff in 36 countries to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on essential health services for women, children and adolescents. 
Sharing the survey findings with Reuters, GFF said that of countries reporting, 87% said the pandemic, fears about infection or lockdown measures designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, had led to disruptions to health workforces. 
More than three-quarters of countries also reported disruptions in supplies of key medicines for mothers and babies, such as antibiotics to treat infections and oxytocin, a drug for preventing excessive bleeding after childbirth. 
The number of GFF countries reporting service disruptions nearly doubled from 10 in April to 19 in June, and the number reporting fewer people seeking essential health services jumped to 22 in June from five in April. 
GFF found that in Liberia, for example, fears about COVID-19 were preventing parents from taking their children to health clinics. In Ghana, some pregnant and lactating mothers were opting to postpone antenatal services and routine immunisations for fear of contracting the pandemic disease. 
“We are seeing declining vaccination rates among children. We’re seeing women accessing services less for ante- or post-natal care. We’re seeing a decline in babies being born in health facilities. And we’re also seeing a slide in outpatient services - for treatments for diarrhoea, malaria, fever, pneumonia for example,” Vledder said. 
Rapidly declining access to reproductive health supplies is also a key worry, Vledder added. The GFF estimates that if the situation does not improve as many as 26 million women could lose access to contraception in the 36 countries, leading to nearly 8 million unintended pregnancies.

In its World Economic Outlook update, the IMF projected that GDP in South Africa, the continent’s most advanced economy, would shrink by 8% in 2020, a bigger contraction than the 5.8% forecast in April. 
South Africa’s strict nationwide lockdown, imposed in late March to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, sharply curtailed production across key sectors such as mining and retail, further hobbling an economy already in recession. 
The lockdown remains in place, but some restrictions have been eased to allow key sectors to resume operations. 
For Africa’s top oil exporter Nigeria, the IMF also projected a significant economic contraction, with GDP seen falling 5.4% this year after an earlier forecast for a 3.4% contraction. 
Nigeria faces economic distress not only from the coronavirus outbreak but also from a sharp fall in crude prices. 
Nigeria’s government has said it expects its economy to contract by 3.4% this year. However, last month Nigeria’s finance minister said the economy could shrink by as much as 8.9% in 2020 in a worst-case scenario. 
Meanwhile, the cost of living in Nigeria has risen steadily. Annual inflation rose for the ninth straight month in May, to a two-year high of 12.4%. (Reporting by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo in Johannesburg and Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos Editing by Gareth Jones)"

The Houston-based company said it had secured debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing of $150 million to fund its operations during the restructuring and that it was working with advisers and stakeholders on a range of alternatives. 
The company was created last year when Aubrey McClendon’s American Energy - Permian Basin LLC, a company he founded in 2014 shortly after being ousted from Chesapeake Energy Corp , merged with its parent company in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy. 
McClendon died in 2016 in a fiery one-car crash in Oklahoma. He built Chesapeake from a small wildcatter into one of the world’s biggest natural gas producers before resigning in 2013, after a corporate governance crisis and investor concerns over his heavy spending. 
Chesapeake Energy is itself widely expected to file for bankruptcy under the weight of too much debt and the drop in energy demand and prices. (Reporting by Shradha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)"

American Champ withdrew from the event after testing positive at a pre-tournament screening while world number four Brooks Koepka and Graeme McDowell also withdrew as a precaution when their caddies tested positive. 
McIlroy, who shot a seven-under 63 in the opening round, praised PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan for allowing the tournament to go ahead despite the positive tests. 
“I thought Jay did a wonderful job yesterday, just relaying the information and where the PGA Tour stands and where we’re going forward,” Northern Irishman McIlroy told reporters. 
“You hear one or two positive tests and people are panicking. I saw a couple of calls to shut the tournament down, which is silly from my point of view. 
“There’s been almost 3,000 tests administered and the percentage of positive tests, it’s a quarter of a percent. I think, as a whole, it has been going really well. There’s a couple of loose ends that we needed to tidy up.” 
The Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is the third of five events on the PGA Tour’s revamped schedule. 
It is closed to spectators in a bid to help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Canadian Mackenzie Hughes fired an error free 10-under 60 to take an early first-round lead, three shots clear of McIlroy.

The vials will be enough to hold up to 2 billion doses, if and when one or more of the potential vaccines in development prove effective, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI) said. 
“This supply is part of CEPI’s efforts to rapidly speed up the vaccine development timeline through making progress on manufacturing in parallel with the clinical development of COVID-19 candidate vaccines,” it said in a statement. 
CEPI told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday it had identified pharmaceutical manufacturers with capacity to produce four billion COVID-19 vaccine doses a year. 
Glass vials are a critical component of immunisation programmes. Without them, vaccines cannot be stored or delivered, and patients cannot be vaccinated. 
Drugmakers have already been warning of a potential shortage of vials to bottle future COVID-19 vaccines. 
CEPI, which is backed by 14 governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Britain’s Wellcome Trust, has deployed up to $829 million so far in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine through partnerships with nine drug developers. 
With this deal, Stevanato - which says it produces 10 billion units a year of drug delivery systems, sterile and bulk glass containers, and diagnostic and medical components - will become a key supplier in CEPI’s COVID-19 vaccine plans. 
CEPI says the ultimate goal is to speed up COVID-19 vaccine development to get a successful vaccine within 12 to 18 months.

The results reveal the tricky politics around energy and the environment as lawmakers debate whether the twin economic and health crises sweeping the globe are an opportunity to speed the transition from fossil fuels. 
The poll shows 36% of Americans believe the U.S. Congress should prioritize clean-energy industries and businesses in the next stimulus package, including 53% of Democrats and 18% of Republicans. 
Another 36% believe Congress should prioritize the most productive industries and businesses regardless of environmental impact, including 24% of Democrats and 57% of Republicans, according to the survey. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online from June 22-23 in the United States, and includes responses from 1,115 adults. 
Congressional and White House representatives are in talks on a new stimulus package to be taken up next month. The government passed an initial $2 trillion round in March. 
Some 60 Democratic lawmakers recently called in a letter to colleagues for the new package to include measures “to spur growth in renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency, clean vehicles, clean and efficient infrastructure, clean fuels, and workforce development.” 
Republicans have pushed back arguing stimulus should address economic damage from the pandemic, not advance a clean energy transition. 
Climate change is a central consideration in Europe’s economic recovery after the pandemic. On Tuesday, Germany’s environment minister announced the country will use its upcoming presidency of the European Union to steer the bloc toward a climate-friendly economic recovery. 
Meanwhile, China is running the risk here of slipping on commitments to reduce carbon emissions as it turns to heavy industry and carbon-intensive projects to shore up its coronavirus-stricken economy.

Some insurers have balked at paying out on business interruption claims, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is asking the courts to clarify the wording in policies, which could lead to more claims being valid. 
The FCA’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is braced for a rise in claims as some financial firms are expected to go under in the pandemic. 
The FSCS is working with the FCA, Bank of England and finance ministry to quantify what could come down the line, said FSCS Chief Executive Caroline Rainbird, a banking industry veteran who took up the reins last year. 
“We will look at scenarios, work with regulators and do desk-top exercises to make sure we are prepared,” Rainbird said. 
Credit unions and smaller financial advisers “could be an issue”, along with more complex pension vehicles, she said. “We are keeping an eye on the insurance sector,” she added. 
Rainbird said the body could if needs be raise additional levies through the financial year. An FSCS running out of money would harm public confidence in financial services, she added. 
FCA Chair Charles Randell said last week that the FSCS’s levy on firms used to pay for compensation claims - which he said was already unacceptably high - is likely to increase due to COVID. 
The FSCS had already bumped up its levy by 44 million pounds to 649 million for the 2020/21 financial year to meet claims from 11,600 investors caught in the collapse last year of London Capital &amp; Finance investment firm. 
It has compensated just 159 investors who had switched from shares to holding “mini-bonds” sold by the now defunct LCF. 
This narrow base for compensation is being challenged in the courts, but in the meantime the FSCS is set to start paying out on claims from LCF investors who were mis-advised. 
The FSCS will give a further update on LCF claims on Friday. (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Jan Harvey)"

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.480 million for the week ended June 20, down from 1.540 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
The weekly jobless claims report, the most timely data on the economy’s health, also showed millions continue to collect unemployment checks more than a month after many businesses resumed operating following closures in mid-March in an effort slow the spread of the respiratory illness. 
Companies are hiring, but others are cutting jobs at nearly the same pace. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
“There were some businesses that tried to maintain their workforce, waiting to see what would happen as businesses reopened,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “Even as the economy is picking up they are not seeing a lot of demand and are deciding that they don’t need that many workers.” 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.3 million claims in the latest week. Claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in late March, but the pace of decline has slowed and they are double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
From manufacturing to transportation, retail and leisure and hospitality industries companies are restructuring to adapt to a vastly changed landscape, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies. State and local governments, whose budgets have been squeezed by the COVID-19 fight, are also cutting jobs. 
Rising coronavirus infections in many parts of the country, including California, Texas and Florida, are likely to hurt employment as some people stay away from restaurants and other consumer-facing establishments, even if businesses are not shut down again. 
“It’s looking like a bumpy ride,” said Josh Wright, chief economist at Wrightside Advisors in New York.

EU leaders agreed in April to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help the 27-nation bloc rebound from the pandemic, but the final details have yet to be agreed. 
“We really need to act quickly now if we want the funds to be available on January 1, 2021,” Kukies told an online event. 
It is not possible to “sugar-coat” the severity of the economic crisis being faced by Europe, and things could get worse before they get better, he said. 
But there are signs that the crisis is “bottoming out” with strong credit expansion in Germany, the EU’s largest economy, during the height of the crisis, Kukies added. 
Germany will drive the bloc’s agenda over the next six months and Kukies said that in financial services there was a need for a harmonised approach to anti-money laundering moves. 
“We need a European supervisor for AML,” Kukies said. 
He also wants the EU to move ahead with improving its capital market, such as by digitalising the issuance, trading and settlement of bonds to encourage companies to raise more funds and cut fragmentation in markets.

The company said earlier this week it would again close seven stores in the Houston area after cases rose there. Last week, it announced a round of shuttering in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina. 
Apple has 271 stores in the United States, all of which closed in March as the novel coronavirus spread. The company says it is evaluating whether to open or close each store based on local conditions in each community, with stores sometimes open in one part of a U.S. state but closed in another. 
Many but not all of Apple’s U.S. stores have reopened since March. After the closures slated for Friday, more than 200 will be open.

The pre-season opener, which would have seen the Dallas Cowboys face the Pittsburgh Steelers in Canton, Ohio, on Aug. 6 this year, will now be played on Aug. 5, 2021. 
The 2020 Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony has also been postponed to August 2021, with 28 former players set to be enshrined in two separate ceremonies next year. 
""The health and safety of our Hall of Famers, fans and volunteers who make enshrinement week so special remains our top priority,"" Pro Football Hall of Fame CEO and president David Baker said in a statement here
“The Hall will honor the Centennial Class of 2020 next August, along with what promises to be an equally spectacular Class of 2021, as part of a multi-day celebration of football.” 
The match has been cancelled twice before in 2011 due to the NFL lockout and in 2016 due to poor field conditions. 
Tickets for the game were sold out in 22 minutes, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and fans will be allowed to use the same tickets for the game as well as the ceremony next year or opt for a refund. 
“We believe postponing enshrinement week events in 2020 is the right way to honor our enshrinees and their families properly, along with the other living Gold Jackets who want to come to Canton for this celebration,” Baker added. 
“We also believe next year promises to be the greatest gathering in football ever.” 
In the face of the new coronavirus pandemic, the NFL, which has 32 teams spread across the United States, has pushed ahead with plans to start the season as scheduled on Sept. 10, culminating with the Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida, on Feb. 7.

When McCumber returned on Tuesday from a solo camping trip in North Carolina he figured he had no chance of joining this week’s major-calibre field but then got a call from the PGA Tour about the option of possibly getting to Connecticut. 
“I found out yesterday afternoon that sort of things working out a certain way would possibly get me in,” McCumber said after an opening five-under-par 65. 
“I got the confirmation about 3:00 on that, and the last flight out of Jacksonville was 5:30, so had to pack in about 25 minutes and head to the airport.” 
McCumber took world number five Webb Simpson’s spot in the field after the 2012 U.S. Open champion withdrew out of caution after a family member tested positive for COVID-19. 
The 29-year-old American, who set out early in the fifth group off the 10th tee with world number two Jon Rahm and Chez Reavie, hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation and was solid with his putter with no misses from within 10 feet. 
McCumber responded immediately after a double-bogey at the par-four 12th when he hit his 258-yard approach at the par-five 13th to three feet, setting himself up for an eagle. He then birdied five of his final nine holes. 
“Obviously getting back into some competition and competitive mode after some time off, little adjustments here and there, but it definitely clicked today, and I felt like this round was sort of coming,” he said. 
Next up for McCumber after a late night and whirlwind 24 hours is rest. “I’m going to take a good nap this afternoon, that’s for sure,” he said. 
“We got in late last night, and obviously just emotions, sort of an array of high, low, going from not being in to maybe in and then sort of that not knowing and then knowing and then scrambling to get to the airport.”

The company’s wholesale business, through which it sells merchandise to department stores and footwear retailers, saw a 50% fall in product shipments in the quarter. 
Retailers have suffered due to store closures brought in place by government-led lockdowns, forcing many to limit their business to online operations. 
Nike’s investments in its digital platform over the years helped the company record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear from the comfort of their homes. 
Net loss came in at $790 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with a profit of $989 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Revenue fell 38% to $6.31 billion in the quarter ended May 31. Analysts on average had expected $7.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

By Liz Hampton and Jennifer Hiller 
HOUSTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies slammed the brakes on returning staff to their Houston offices as COVID-19 cases soared and top hospitals warned they could soon run out of beds for the most severely ill patients. 
Texas officials imposed restrictions as new cases in the state topped 5,000 on three consecutive days as of Thursday. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds were 97% full at Houston’s Texas Medical Center, which said it may soon move to increase ICU capacity assignments, officials said. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced a phased reopening of shops, bars and amusement parks from May 1, and businesses have rolled out their own office restarts. But on Wednesday, he warned of a “massive outbreak” and urged people to stay at home. 
Many energy firms qualify as essential, and therefore are free to staff normally, but the surge in illness and hospitalizations has prompted large employers to delay or halt openings. 
Halliburton Co, the second-largest U.S. oilfield service company by revenue, delayed for two weeks a second phase of its return-to-work plan, and power producer Calpine pushed back the start of returning non-essential workers to offices until August from July 6, representatives for the two companies said. 
Chevron also has delayed its reopening plans for further evaluation, said spokesman Sean Comey. About 5% of its Houston office staff and about 2% of its San Ramon, California, workforce are in their offices now, he said. 
Midcoast Energy, a natural gas pipeline company, reopened on June 1 but sent Houston employees home three weeks later after two tested positive for the virus, said a person familiar with the matter. President Robert Bond did not respond to requests for comment. 
Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips returned some white-collar workers to their campuses in May or this month. Exxon will remain below 50% capacity at its Houston-area facility, a spokesman said. Conoco is prepared to change its return-to-office plan if needed, a spokesman said. 
Phillips 66 said the vast majority of its staff had returned and would remain working from their offices. 
“We are a critical infrastructure industry and have an ongoing obligation to continue operating,” spokesman Joe Gannon said, noting that the company follows Centers for Disease Control and government advisories.

Gordon, in his eighth PGA Tour start, fired an eight-under-par 62 to sit three shots clear of Americans Xander Schauffele (68) and Brendan Steele (62) at TPC River Highlands. 
Among those a further shot off the pace were two-times major champion Zach Johnson (64) and world number one Rory McIlroy, who was one under through his first four holes. 
Overnight leader Mackenzie Hughes of Canada went out late and was even par through one hole to remain at 10 under. 
Gordon, who started on the back nine, got off to a flying start as he mixed six birdies and one bogey over his opening eight holes. He added another three birdies on the front nine, including a 24-foot birdie at the par-three eighth. 
“I knew that (the course) was going to be gettable this morning,” said Gordon. “Just tried to come into today with a really positive mindset and aggressive mindset and I was able to do that.” 
Denny McCarthy withdrew from the Travelers Championship ahead of the second round after he became the third PGA Tour player to test positive for COVID-19. 
McCarthy said he felt tired after posting a three-under 67 in the opening round. 
“Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night with additional aches and soreness and sensed something was off,” said McCarthy. “I felt like the only thing to do was get tested at that point before I went to the course.” 
Bud Cauley, who played with McCarthy on Thursday, tested negative twice but withdrew as a precautionary measure, bringing the number of coronavirus-related withdrawals this week to seven.

By Huw Jones 
LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Britain’s financial services compensation body is “keeping an eye” on insurers facing claims from companies whose business has been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, its chief executive told Reuters. 
Some insurers have balked at paying out on business interruption claims, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is asking the courts to clarify the wording in policies, which could lead to more claims being valid. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is braced for a rise in claims as some financial firms go under during the pandemic, and is working with the FCA, Bank of England and finance ministry to quantify that, its Chief Executive Caroline Rainbird said. 
“We will look at scenarios, work with regulators and do desk-top exercises to make sure we are prepared,” Rainbird, a banking industry veteran who took up the reins last year, said. 
Credit unions and smaller financial advisers “could be an issue”, along with more complex pension vehicles, she said. 
Rainbird said the body could if needs be raise additional levies through the financial year. An FSCS running out of money would harm public confidence in financial services, she added. 
The FSCS had already bumped up its levy by 44 million pounds to 649 million for the 2020/21 financial year to meet claims from 11,600 investors caught in the collapse last year of London Capital &amp; Finance investment firm. 
It has compensated just 159 investors who had switched from shares to holding “mini-bonds” sold by the now defunct LCF. This narrow base for compensation is being challenged in the courts. 
Separately on Thursday, the FSCS said it has so far issued 281 decisions on claims and paid 5.1 million pounds ($6.3 million) to investors who received misleading advice from LCF. 
The FSCS said it received an extra 100,000 emails from LCF’s email server in June, which will mean a likely increase in how many investors will be eligible for compensation. 
LCF left investors facing losses of up to 237 million pounds.

The report issued by the Government Accountability Office on Thursday marked the first review of the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and made recommendations to lawmakers how to improve the fight to come out crisis. 
Some of its harshest criticism was reserved for the Small Business Administration (SBA), which oversees a $670 billion emergency loan programme to help companies survive the pandemic, and the lack of a plan from the Department of Transportation to improve the aviation sector’s response to outbreaks. 
Detailing its findings on the coronavirus testing data, the GAO said the data that was collected at times included antibody tests that detect prior infections, and sometimes included counts on the number of samples tested, which could include multiple tests for one person. 
“The absence of complete and consistent COVID-19 testing data reported through May 31, 2020, has made it more difficult to track and know the infection rate, mitigate the effect of infections, and inform decisions on reopening communities,” the watchdog said. 
It said the United States is also missing a national aviation-preparedness plan for infectious diseases. 
“While the Department of Transportation agreed that a plan is needed, as of May 2020, no such plan had been developed,” the watchdog said. It said the Transportation Department has maintained that other U.S. agencies should take the lead in planning for outbreaks. 
As part of its recommendations to U.S. lawmakers, the watchdog said it is urging them to take legislative action to require the Transportation Department to work with others to develop a national plan. 
It criticised the SBA for failing to give detailed descriptions of loans made in its data, and not outlining plans to review loans worth less than $2 million. 
“We encountered the most difficulty trying to obtain information from the Small Business Administration (SBA),” said the watchdog,. “SBA to date has failed to provide information critical to our review.” 
The SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The level of transparency around U.S. government spending to fight the pandemic has been a contentious issue between various watchdogs and government agencies. 
According to the watchdog, the U.S. government has set aside $2.6 trillion worth of spending to fight the pandemic, but spending so far is unknown as all agencies are not required to report their expenditures until July 2020.

The number of successful applicants to Canada’s Global Skills Strategy (GSS) program rose five-fold over its first three years, with more than 23,000 workers approved under the top five tech categories, data provided to Reuters by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) shows. 
More than 2,300 applications for those same top five tech roles were approved from January to March 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 shutdowns that led to border closures and a sharp drop in immigration. The program boasts a two-week processing time. 
Immigration lawyers told Reuters they were broadly in favor of the program, which some described as transparent and consistent, and an example of how Canada has been able to take advantage of Trump’s immigration stance since he entered the White House in 2017. 
“There are employers who have non-U.S. employees in the U.S. who are definitely looking seriously at Canada,” said Kyle Hyndman, a partner with McCrea Immigration Law in Vancouver, who was contacted this week by a “major” company about bringing employees to Canada. 
On Monday, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers from entering the United States on certain visas, which a Trump administration official said would create 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers. 
“The fact that people started contacting me pretty much the next day is perhaps a suggestion that there are going to be more people interested,” Hyndman said. 
U.S. technology companies including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc have in recent years expanded their Canadian operations, although most companies declined to comment on their GSS usage or how Trump’s recent announcement will impact their hiring plans. 
Tobi Lutke, the chief executive officer of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify, was quick to tout the Canada’s attraction following Trump’s immigration move. 
The program “has made it possible to hire top talent beyond our borders,” said Sandeep Anand, senior lead on the global mobility team at Shopify, adding that it has helped relocate employees to Canada. 
The majority of approved applicants to the fast-track visa program were computer programmers and interactive media developers, followed by information systems analysts and consultants, the IRCC data shows. 
Indian citizens accounted for 62.1% of successful applicants to the fast-track program, followed by Chinese citizens. Nearly 1,000 U.S. citizens also have seen their applications approved. 
The GSS data only covers the period up to March of this year, just before broader immigration in Canada fell off a cliff due to border closures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Lawyers, however, don’t expect it to last. 
Betsy Kane, one of the founding partners of Capelle Kane Immigration Lawyers in Ottawa, said the program is going to see a surge of applications.

Liverpool’s 30-year wait for their 19th English top-flight title ended on Thursday after second-placed Manchester City were beaten by Chelsea.

COVID-19 antibody tests not backed by solid data 
Studies assessing the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests had major shortcomings, an analysis released on Thursday found, indicating that existing research does not prove the tests can confirm with certainty whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus. Cochrane, a British-based journal that reviews research evidence, looked at 54 studies that sought to measure the reliability of the antibody blood tests. The studies were often small, did not use the most reliable methods, and their results were often incomplete, the analysis found. The analyzed studies looked at nearly 16,000 blood samples, 89% of which had a high risk of bias because patients were unlikely to match the general population. The review identified data from 25 commercial COVID-19 tests, a fraction of the roughly 300 such tests that exist. The review did not include tests offered by Roche or Abbott Laboratories, which were approved by regulators after the analysis began. (reut.rs/2CAXSf1; bit.ly/2YyTxlb) 
Pregnant women have greater risk for severe COVID-19 
Pregnant women face an increased risk of severe coronavirus infections, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released on Thursday showed. Pregnant women with COVID-19 are 50% more likely to need intensive care and 70% more likely to be put on mechanical ventilators than non-pregnant women, although pregnant women did not have a higher risk of death, CDC researchers reported in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black pregnant women appear to be disproportionately affected by the coronavirus infection during pregnancy, the study also found. Earlier in the pandemic, researchers in China and Britain reported no extra risk for pregnant women. But last month, a large study in Sweden found pregnant women infected with the virus were more than five times as likely to need intensive care and four times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation.

Spanish researchers have found traces of the novel coronavirus in Barcelona wastewater collected in March 2019, nine months before COVID-19 was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. University of Barcelona virologists led by Albert Bosch had been monitoring wastewater since April of this year. When they decided to test older samples, they said they found genetic material from the virus in one sample from March 12, 2019. The presence of the virus genome so early in Spain, if confirmed, would indicate the pathogen appeared much earlier than previously thought. In their not-yet-peer-reviewed paper posted on Friday on medRxiv, the researchers also said they found the virus in Barcelona wastewater from Jan. 15 of this year, 41 days before the first case was officially reported there. Joan Ramon Villalbi of the Spanish Society for Public Health and Sanitary Administration said it was still early to draw definitive conclusions based on these findings. ""When it's just one result, you always want more data, more studies, more samples to confirm it and rule out a laboratory error or a methodological problem,"" he said.

Flu vaccine use in elderly may be linked to community coronavirus mortality 
COVID-19 death rates may be lower in communities where large proportions of elderly residents received flu vaccines, based on data from more than 2,000 counties around the United States. Researchers found that a 10% increase in vaccination coverage among people older than 65 was associated on average with a 28% decrease in the COVID-19 death rate in a given county. It is possible that social, economic and health factors contributed to lower coronavirus mortality in counties where more seniors got flu vaccines, the researchers said. Their findings were based on data reported by counties, not by individuals. Still, the researchers said, ""The significant public health implications of this possibility point to an urgent need for studying the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 mortality at the individual level, to investigate both the epidemiology and any underlying biological mechanism."" On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said flu vaccination during the pandemic is very important to reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and ease burdens on the healthcare system.

Bring sick kids for medical care during lockdown, doctors say 
With lockdown orders in place, parents may hesitate to take sick children to the doctor. But research by pediatricians in Britain concluded that if medical care is delayed - particularly when a child appears seriously ill - ""the unintended consequences of the lockdown will do more harm and claim more children's lives than COVID-19."" Among nearly 2,500 pediatricians surveyed for the study published on Thursday in Archives of Disease in Childhood, one in three said they had dealt with medical emergencies in children who probably would have sought medical care before becoming so ill were it not for the pandemic. Children with diabetes were most often involved, but also those with life threatening blood infections and cancer, survey responses indicated. (bit.ly/3i4CSNY)

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg is due to hold a news conference about “the coronavirus situation and travelling” at 1600 CET (1400 GMT). 
The Nordic country, which is not a member of the European Union but belongs to the passport-free Schengen travel zone, has some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe. 
Most non-residents, including tourists, are currently not allowed into the country. There are exceptions for those who work in sectors deemed crucial, such as agriculture or oil, and those who can prove a family link with Norway. They must undergo a 10-day quarantine. 
Since June 15 citizens and foreign residents of Denmark, Iceland, Finland and the Swedish island of Gotland have been allowed to enter Norway, and without undergoing quarantine. 
People from mainland Sweden are not allowed into the country given the higher number of infections there. 
Norway moved early to impose a lockdown in mid-March and was able to begin lifting restrictions after Easter. The main restriction still in place is a ban on gatherings of more than 200 people. 
Norway, with a population of 5.4 million, had confirmed a total of 8,793 COVID-19 cases, with 249 deaths, as of Thursday.

The number of successful applicants to Canada’s Global Skills Strategy (GSS) programme rose five-fold over its first three years, with more than 23,000 workers approved under the top five tech categories, data provided to Reuters by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) shows. 
More than 2,300 applications for those same top five tech roles were approved from January to March 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 shutdowns that led to border closures and a sharp drop in immigration. The programme boasts a two-week processing time. 
Immigration lawyers told Reuters they were broadly in favour of the programme, which some described as transparent and consistent, and an example of how Canada has been able to take advantage of Trump’s immigration stance since he entered the White House in 2017. 
“There are employers who have non-U.S. employees in the U.S. who are definitely looking seriously at Canada,” said Kyle Hyndman, a partner with McCrea Immigration Law in Vancouver, who was contacted this week by a “major” company about bringing employees to Canada. 
On Monday, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers from entering the United States on certain visas, which a Trump administration official said would create 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers. 
“The fact that people started contacting me pretty much the next day is perhaps a suggestion that there are going to be more people interested,” Hyndman said. 
U.S. technology companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have in recent years expanded their Canadian operations, although most companies declined to comment on their GSS usage or how Trump’s recent announcement will impact their hiring plans. 
Tobi Lutke, the chief executive officer of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify (SHOP.TO), was quick to tout the Canada’s attraction following Trump’s immigration move. 
The programme “has made it possible to hire top talent beyond our borders,” said Sandeep Anand, senior lead on the global mobility team at Shopify, adding that it has helped relocate employees to Canada. 
The majority of approved applicants to the fast-track visa programme were computer programmers and interactive media developers, followed by information systems analysts and consultants, the IRCC data shows. 
Indian citizens accounted for 62.1% of successful applicants to the fast-track programme, followed by Chinese citizens. Nearly 1,000 U.S. citizens also have seen their applications approved. 
The GSS data only covers the period up to March of this year, just before broader immigration in Canada fell off a cliff due to border closures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Lawyers, however, don’t expect it to last. 
Betsy Kane, one of the founding partners of Capelle Kane Immigration Lawyers in Ottawa, said the programme is going to see a surge of applications.

By Erwin Seba and Zachary Ferguson 
HOUSTON/MIAMI, June 26 (Reuters) - Bar and restaurant owners in Texas and Florida were fuming on Friday after state officials abruptly slapped new restrictions on their businesses due to a spike in new COVID-19 cases. 
Owners warned the sudden reversals, just weeks after accelerated reopenings, will drive some out of business. 
“You can’t turn a bar into an UberEats,” said Jeff Kaplan, co-owner of Houston’s Axelrad Beer Garden. He said businesses could not stay afloat relying on the new rules that provide to-go sales but not alcohol consumption on the premises. 
Houston officials advised residents to stay home, and Texas ordered doctors to end elective surgeries as new coronavirus cases set records on three consecutive days. Florida reported nearly 9,000 new infections on Friday, also a record high. 
Houston restaurant owner Peter Mitchell said his revenue has been running a third of normal and fell further as virus cases soared in the region. 
“It’ll be a close call as to whether we stay open,” he said. 
“I wish we had tougher restrictions for another month when we did the 25% occupancy (phase),” said Mitchell. He said his business never has exceeded 25% occupancy, but noted that no regulators have ever checked. 
Florida owners also complained that counties and cities in the state had inconsistent operating rules. 
“The level of ambiguity that we’ve run into every step of the way has been really challenging,” said Will Thompson, owner of Miami’s Jaguar Sun. “It comes back to the lack of clarity from officials.” 
Gabriel Orta, whose company runs hotel food and beverage operations in Miami, said rules are inconsistent. “We don’t have the leadership that we need when we go into a catastrophe,” he added. 
Anthony Wegmann, who ran four bars and restaurants in Texas, closed two after a landlord would not grant a reprieve on rent. “There’s no way a business can pay 100% of their bills on 25% of their revenue,” he said. 
Some are willing to accept the loss of business for the public good. “It was a little unexpected,” said Sara Murray, manager of the Cheers Pub in Friendswood, Texas. “In the end we all have to do what we have to do to keep everyone safe.

“We always have to keep the big picture in mind. Europe wants to become the first greenhouse gas-neutral continent by 2050. This is the most crucial thing that we can do for future generations,” Svenja Schulze said on Tuesday ahead of a meeting of EU environment ministers. 
Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency on July 1 and will chair meetings of EU ministers until the end of the year. 
The climate apex of Germany’s EU presidency was intended to be an EU-China summit in Leipzig in September, where the EU hoped to coax the world’s biggest emitter into raising its emissions-cutting ambitions ahead of a crucial U.N. climate summit in November. 
But the pandemic meant the Leipzig summit is being rescheduled and the U.N. talks have been delayed until November 2021. Meanwhile, the EU faces the challenge of rebuilding its virus-battered economy without compromising its climate commitments. 
The European Commission has said spending from its proposed 750 billion euro ($846.38 billion) coronavirus recovery fund must “do no harm” to the bloc’s green goals. It has earmarked funding for electric vehicles and low-carbon hydrogen fuel - areas also in line for support from Germany’s national stimulus package. 
Schulze called the Commission proposal a “good basis” for the EU’s economic recovery, which she said must be “socially fair and ecologically sound”. 
Schulze said she will prioritise striking a deal to increase the EU’s 2030 climate target to a 50% or 55% emissions reduction against 1990 levels. 
Tough talks lie ahead. Bulgaria said on Tuesday it could not achieve a higher 2030 national climate goal. The Czech Republic said the Commission should assess the individual impact of a new 2030 target on each EU country. Countries including Germany, Denmark, France and the Netherlands all back a 55% target.

Twenty-five U.S. states reported more new cases last week than the previous week, including 10 states that saw weekly new infections rise more than 50%, and 12 states that posted new records, according to the analysis of data from The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
Texas reported one of the largest rises in new cases at 24,000 for the week ended June 21, an increase of 84% from the previous week. The number of COVID-19 tests that came back positive in the state rose to 10%, from 7%. 
New cases in Florida rose 87% last week to almost 22,000, with the state’s positive test rate nearly doubling to 11%. 
Arizona reported 17,000 new cases, a 90% increase, with 20% of tests coming back positive, according to the analysis. 
(GRAPHIC-Where coronavirus cases are rising in the United States, here) 
The governors of all three states have attributed the increases in new cases to more testing, and to younger residents not following social distancing guidelines. Some health experts have criticized these states for reopening too quickly without adequate restrictions, for instance not making it mandatory to wear masks in public. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended states wait for new COVID-19 cases to fall for 14 days before easing social distancing restrictions. 
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are in compliance with that guideline, the analysis showed, down from 17 states the prior week. New York leads with 10 straight weeks of declines, followed by Rhode Island, Illinois and Washington, D.C. 
Nationally, the number of new COVID-19 cases had been falling on a weekly basis through May. Last week’s 25% jump came after a 1% rise in the second week of June and a 3% increase in the first week of June.

United withdrew their annual financial targets in May after losing about 23 million pounds ($28 million) in quarterly revenue due to the season being temporarily suspended because of the coronavirus crisis. 
The Premier League restarted this month but fans have been barred from attending games, and Solskjaer said United, who also have 429 million pounds in debt, would adopt a cautious approach to spending. 
“We’ll have to take a big look at things ourselves to see how hard we’ve been hit,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final match at Norwich City. 
“It’s not for me to say we are going to have X amount because I don’t really know. We are a financially strong club, but we are also probably being hit more than anybody else.” 
United are fifth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, with seven games left to play. 
With second-placed Manchester City facing a European ban for breaching UEFA financial rules, fifth place should guarantee qualification for the lucrative Champions League, unless City win an appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 
City will discover the fate of their appeal next month, while United could also qualify for Europe’s elite club competition by winning the Europa League this season. 
“Let’s see how quickly we can get our fans back into the stadium,” Solskjaer added. 
“There’s still a lot of uncertainty and these three or four months, every businessman in the world, every footballer in the world, I think everyone is still unsure what the effect will be.”

It was in the central Chinese city, the home of China’s first Grand Slam champion Li Na, that the novel coronavirus first emerged before spreading to the rest of the world, forcing the suspension of professional tennis in early March. 
Wuhan has accounted for the majority of China’s coronavirus deaths to date and the city was subject to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world for 76 days. 
“To go through that, to overcome that, I think it’s huge,” the tournament’s co-director Brenda Perry told Reuters from her home in Auckland. 
“It’s huge symbolism and I think very inspiring for everybody there. 
“At the moment that’s one of the first to experience the closest to being back to normal that we see around the world. It’s a very hopeful story for not just Wuhan but for China, for the world, of overcoming a huge challenge.” 
After a cluster of new cases of the virus in May sparked fears of a second spike, Wuhan tested 9.9 million people out of a population of 11 million. 
“I feel that Wuhan did some incredible job on recovery,” Perry said. 
“I don’t think we hear much about that. Not as much as the fact that COVID-19 started in Wuhan. And they have almost everything back to normal, whether it’s transport or restaurants or cinemas, people going back to work in the offices or their industries.” 
Perry said she had been in touch with the local organising team on a daily basis as they prepare to start the tournament on Oct. 19, pending government approval and confirmation that players will be able to travel. 
“I’ve never heard from Wuhan, ‘we can’t do this’,” she said, adding that a final call on the event was expected by early August. 
“In many ways Wuhan is fortunate that the tournament is towards the end of the calendar and it’s got the maximum time for recovery.” 
‘ZERO HESITATION’ 
There are many roadblocks still and Perry concedes that convincing players to sign up will be a tall order. 
The current top three in the rankings - Ash Barty, Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova - were in the 2019 field of the event. 
Perry appreciates that athletes will have health concerns but she hopes to use her background as a former professional and a player representative on the WTA board to help convince them to play. 
“It’s going to be very important that we communicate to the players,” she said. 
“(If it’s unsafe) I’ll be the first one to go ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be going there’. 
“I have zero hesitation right now about going to Wuhan ... I believe it’s one of the safest cities to go to anywhere in the world because it’s probably the most tested city in the world.” 
Because of the financial impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on sport, Wuhan, like all of the WTA’s Premier 5 events, will see a 32% cut in prize money. 
The Wuhan Open is currently committed to having no fans 13,500 of them turned out for the 2019 final and negotiations with sponsors are expected to be tricky. 
“It’s a very different conversation now and we are looking at trying to be innovative as to what we can offer,” Perry said. 
“One of the things could be being associated with such a positive comeback. I think that will hopefully be a story of interest for our sponsors to be associated with.”

“I am really concerned about scenes at Pier Head tonight. I appreciate LFC fans want to celebrate but please, for your own safety, and that of others, go home and celebrate at home,” Anderson said on Twitter. 
“COVID-19 is still a major risk and our city has already lost far too many people to the illness. 
“People are asking why we are not moving the fans on, or taking action to prevent them gathering. Councils simply do not have the power to do this. If you know someone who is there, please message them and ask them to come home.”

What doctors have learned about fighting COVID-19: 
* Patients are at increased risk of blood clots, and blood thinning agents can help. 
* “Proning” - putting patients on their stomachs to relieve pressure on the lungs - can stave off the need for mechanical ventilation. 
* Besides the respiratory system and lungs, the coronavirus can attack many other organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. 
* The most promising treatments so far seem to be the anti-viral remdesivir; dexamethasone, a steroid to treat the body’s inflammatory response to COVID-19; and plasma donated by patients who have antibodies to the disease. 
* More widespread testing and quicker results helps relieve pressure on hospitals. 
* Information-sharing among health professionals worldwide is crucial. 
* Prevention is critical. Doctors are relying on the public to do their part with good hygiene, masks and social distancing. 
Some of the biggest unknowns: 
* Exactly which treatments will work for which patients. 
* How quickly some treatments will gain widespread distribution, especially remdesivir. 
* How long it will take for COVID-19 patients to recover. 
* The long-term effects of the infection. 
“If the best lesson we’ve learned is to turn patients onto their stomachs instead of their backs,” said Valory Wangler, chief medical officer at Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Services, in Gallup, New Mexico, “it means we’re far from a miracle cure.”

The AstraZeneca vaccine is considered the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development to obtain licensure and become an official vaccine against the disease, according to the World Health Organization. 
The British drugmaker is already carrying out large-scale, mid-stage human trials of the vaccine, which was developed by researchers at Oxford University. 
Elcio Franco, Brazil’s No.2 public health official, said in a press conference that the country will initially produce some 30 million doses of the vaccine, half by December and half by January of next year. 
Franco said Brazil is paying for the vaccine but is aware of the risk, in case the vaccine does not pass all necessary licensure requirements or another vaccine obtains approval faster. 
The vaccine will be produced by Brazil’s Fundação Osvaldo Cruz, also known as Fiocruz, the country’s leading public health organization, Franco said. 
Brazil is the world’s second most affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 1.2 million confirmed cases as of Friday and more than 55,000 deaths. 
Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for this response to the pandemic. He has dismissed the severity of the disease and has shown indifference to the rising death toll while also pushing treatment using an unproven anti-malaria drug.

A plasma-derived treatment for COVID-19
Over the weekend, Andrew Dunn reports on the the attempts to make a plasma-derived coronavirus treatment. 
By now you've probably heard about the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which uses part of the donated blood of recovered COVID-19 patients with the hopes of boosting the immune system's response in people actively fighting off the virus. 
Well 10 drugmakers, including Japanese pharma giant Takeda, are looking at a way to standardize that process, making a plasma-based therapy that could come in handy as we face the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic later this year.

The monthly drop in gross domestic product was felt in almost all sectors - from the country’s shuttered restaurants and bars to its building sites and factories - and was the largest since comparable records began in 1997. 
“The sharp contraction in UK Q1 GDP comes as little surprise, but does clearly highlight the magnitude of the challenge facing policymakers,” JP Morgan market strategist Hugh Gimber said. 
In the first three months of the year, GDP contracted by 2.0% from the last three months of 2019, the biggest drop since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008, the Office for National Statistics said. 
The Bank of England said last week that the contraction of the economy in the April-June period could approach 25% and lead to the largest annual decline in more than three centuries. 
British two-year government bond yields GB2YT=RR sank to a record low of -0.045% after the data, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England will ramp up its record 645 billion pounds ($791 billion) of asset purchases next month. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said Britain was now in the midst of a significant recession. 
“We have to support people’s jobs, their incomes, livelihoods at this time, and support businesses so we can get through this period of severe disruption and emerge stronger on the other side,” he said after the GDP data. 
A newspaper said on Tuesday that finance ministry officials have warned Sunak the budget deficit could swell to a record 337 billion pounds this year from just 55 billion pounds forecast in March. 
On Tuesday, Britain’s government extended a costly job support programme for another four months, though businesses will need to pick up more of the tab from August. 
DELAYED LOCKDOWN 
The decline in first-quarter GDP was slightly smaller than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and less than the 3.8% slump suffered by the euro zone in the first quarter. But Britain only started its lockdown on March 23, later than many other euro zone countries. 
COVID-19 has killed more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom, the highest death toll reported in Europe so far. 
Economists said output appeared to have fallen around a fifth after the lockdown came into force. 
Separate data from the British Retail Consortium trade body showed retail spending dropped almost a fifth in April. Barclaycard said consumer spending had dropped more than a third. 
Wednesday’s ONS figures showed household consumption fell by 1.8% in the first quarter, the most since 2008. 
The BoE said last week the economy could rebound if coronavirus restrictions are lifted, pencilling in a 15% recovery after a historic 14% fall in GDP for 2020 as a whole. 
But it warned recovery might be slower, especially if consumers prove cautious about returning to their normal lives, a view shared by many economists. 
“The UK’s economic engine will be much harder to kickstart than it was to stall,” Rabobank economist Stefan Koopman said. 
“Talk of a V-shaped recovery feels like wishful thinking, and we expect prolonged periods of depressed growth across the majority of the economy. A flatter, U-shaped recovery is more likely,” he said.

The meeting also comes two days after the governors announced that they had selected Republican donor Louis DeJoy to be the next postmaster general to replace a retiring Megan Brennan. 
Top of mind for the governors will be the budget shortfall, according to a person knowledgeable about the agenda. 
The service, which was struggling before efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus prompted a widespread economic shutdown, is funded entirely through services and postage and has been hurt by advertisers’ decision to reduce mail during the pandemic. 
The U.S. Congress has authorized the Treasury Department to lend it up to $10 billion as part of a $2.3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. President Donald Trump has threatened to block that aid. 
Since early in his administration, the president has criticized the post office, saying it was poorly run and charges too little to deliver packages. Many of those packages are sent by online retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), whose founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which has been critical of the president. 
Without assistance, the service may run out of money in September, even as Americans increasingly turn to online shopping as the pandemic batters the U.S. economy. The current postmaster general told a congressional committee last month that the new coronavirus alone could mean $13 billion in lost revenue this year. 
The pandemic has also caused a surge of interest in expanding options to vote by mail rather than crowding into polling places, making it more important that funding extends past November for the presidential election. 
The board meeting will also address the post office’s response to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, including employee safety, according to a person knowledgeable about the agenda. 
The disease has killed more than 50 of the service’s 600,000 workers, said James Horwitz, a spokesman for the American Postal Workers Union. A spokesman for the postal service declined to confirm the deaths. COVID-19 has killed more than 75,000 Americans. 
The U.S. Postal Service has been struggling for years as online communication replaces letters, and after a 2006 law required it to pre-fund its employee-pension and retirement health care costs for the next seventy-five years.

Co-director of the intensive care unit at CommonSpirit's Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center, Dr. Zafia Anklesaria, 35, who is seven months pregnant, removes a tracheostomy tube from COVID-19 patient Vicente Arredondo, 65, in the intensive care unit at the hospital where she works, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 18, 2020. ""Yay, you did it, you are officially liberated!"" said Anklesaria to Arredondo after she removed the tube. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson 
It was not until she was back in her office and had removed most of her protective equipment that he made his presence known. 
Anklesaria is seven months pregnant with her first child. The 35-year works as a co-director of the intensive care unit at CommonSpirit’s Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center, a downtown Los Angeles hospital that mostly serves lower-income Hispanic and African-American populations. 
The hospital’s 22-bed COVID-19 intensive care unit has been at or close to capacity since the end of March. Some nurses are pulling 24-hour shifts due to the high volume of patients in critical condition, she said. 
“The socio-economic class that we serve, people tend to live in close quarters, they don’t really have the privilege of good social distancing, and they are tending to get more infected as a result,” Anklesaria said. 
People living in the highest poverty areas of Los Angeles county are dying of COVID-19 at more than twice the rate of those in the wealthiest areas, according to data from the county’s department for public health. 
Anklesaria’s 12-hour shift starts at 7 am. She works four days a week on average in the ICU and another one to two days doing pulmonary consultations with patients. 
After getting an update from the night shift she begins her rounds, donning and doffing her personal protective equipment as she enters and exits patients’ rooms. Nurses check on her regularly, making sure she is hydrated, properly protected and takes breaks to eat. 
“I don’t think I could do this job pregnant without their help,” Anklesaria said. She has been lucky to have an easy pregnancy and the baby has been “really well behaved.” 
“You’ve allowed your mom to do her job very well,” she said to her belly. 
She worries, though, that the baby will hear the stress and frustration in her voice as she goes about her day. 
“So I do try and reassure him when I get time to myself, I look down and say it’s all good, we’ve got this,” she said. 
Still, there are physical limitations: she is slowly finding it harder to stay on her feet for long periods of time and often comes home with backache. 
A WORRIED HUSBAND 
One May morning she had good news - one of the hospital’s first COVID-19 patients, an employee who had spent almost four weeks on the ventilator, was ready to have his tracheostomy tube removed. 
“Yay, you did it, you are officially liberated!” she told 65-year old Vicente Arredondo as she removed the tube. 
When she returned home, exhausted, her husband Aryan Jafari, 30, held back the dog as she dashed to the shower. She initially brought up the possibility of isolating herself from him, but he wouldn’t hear of it. 
He worries about her and the baby, but “he is fortunately understanding of me wanting to and needing to work,” she said. “This is a job we sign up for. If we don’t do it, who’s going to do it?” 
Jafari is an engineer and best convinced by data, so she has sent him studies suggesting pregnant women and babies are not at a greater risk from the coronavirus. She has promised her family if any evidence to the contrary emerges, she will step away from the ICU. 
Anklesaria, who comes from a family of doctors in India, has been in the United States since college. Her parents still live in Kolkata and she worries they won’t be able to come for the birth. 
Due to the virus, she has to go to her prenatal visits alone, though her husband has joined her ultrasound appointments via FaceTime. 
He gives her written questions for her obstetrician to answer: can she do this, can she do that? 
“The answer is always: ‘yes’.”

The liquid is plasma from a recently recovered patient, believed to be rich in virus antibodies and which immunologist Abdullah and his team in the southern city of Basra have been using to treat critical COVID-19 cases since April. 
He now hopes to get health ministry support to use plasma as a generalised treatment before patients’ conditions become life-threatening, but he says he is facing a shortage of donors. 
“Among all recovered patients, only three percent (of eligible donors) volunteer,” he said. “... If half of those recovered patients came, we would have enough (plasma) to treat patients in Basra until the end of the year.” 
While the effectiveness of plasma as a coronavirus treatment remains unclear, the health ministry is allowing it to be gathered at blood banks and used under certain conditions, while the global pharma industry is working to develop antibody-based therapies. 
Abdullah is convinced that plasma helps patients’ weakened immune systems fight the virus and, to compensate for the shortage of donors, is using a plasma exchange machine that injects replacement fluids to increase the yield per patient from the standard 400ml to up to 3000ml. 
Once he has enough volunteers he says he will revert to standard extraction levels but for the time being, and as Iraq’s COVID epidemic continues to spread, Abdullah is sticking to the higher-yield procedure. 
He is hopeful his methods will eventually be vetted and adopted abroad. 
“I encourage people to come and donate. But most people are afraid, I don’t know why,” said donor Basim Jassem, before posing for pictures with his super-sized plasma bag. 
“They take it from (us) and replace it with a replacement fluid. There is nothing special about it.” 
Iraq’s COVID death toll stands at just over 1,250, with more than 34,500 people infected, according to health ministry figures. 
A ministry spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment on this article.

Maria Angela, 56, who has tested positive for COVID-19, is transferred by Dr Jorge Hernandez, 35, and health workers from her home at the riverside community Menino de Deus, onto an ambulance boat as she is taken to hospital, as healthcare workers visit riverside communities to check on residents during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in the municipality of Portel, on Marajo island, Para state, Brazil, June 13, 2020. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino 
Her family, Brazilian acai berry farmers on a tributary of the Amazon River, put her in a small boat with an outboard motor and raced down the winding Acuti Pereira River to the nearest health clinic in the town of Portel. 
Without tests to confirm if she had COVID-19 or sufficient facilities to treat her if she did, officials at that outpost directed them further downriver to the biggest hospital nearby, in the town of Breves. 
Six hours had passed by the time they reached Breves. 
Silva was already dead. 
“To be honest, there are a lot of negative thoughts among us,” said her nephew Felipe Costa Silva, after making the return trip with her coffin in the same boat. “How long is this going to last for? How many people are going to die?” 
As the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil rockets past 1 million cases, more than anywhere outside the United States, the frontlines have shifted increasingly from modern hospitals in major cities to poor, remote corners of this massive country. 
The cities of Belem and Macapa at the mouth of the Amazon River emerged as major coronavirus hotspots in April and May. The virus has since spread deep into surrounding rural areas. 
Reuters spent a week accompanying medical professionals in their battle with the pandemic near Marajo Island, which splits the Amazon in two as it approaches the Atlantic Ocean. 
In isolated settlements built on stilts along the river, most households survive on fishing and harvesting local fruits, earning just a few dollars a day. Social distancing is nearly impossible in wooden shacks built close together. Many lack phones and it can take a day or more to reach health clinics. 
The coronavirus has taken root here, killing scores and infecting hundreds more, public health records show. Reuters saw that severe infections are often identified and treated late, when odds are against the patients. 
Yet public health professionals put on a brave face, making house calls and ferrying patients on hours-long boat trips. 
“It’s quite complicated because of the difficulty of access,” said Alex Glaison, a medic, after treating a patient in their riverside home. “What keeps us going is getting results.” 
Some residents live 36 hours from the town center, turning healthcare into a logistical nightmare, said Nizomar Junior, the municipal health secretary in Portel, a small town just across the river from Marajo Island. 
He leads a sprawling team of medics that routinely travel hours on end, often battling unpredictable currents and fast-approaching weather fronts. 
Maria Luiza Costa, a manioc farmer, is one of those isolated residents. She and her mother had come down with headaches and flu-like symptoms, but their coronavirus cases were not confirmed until medical workers visited their home, tucked far up a tributary. 
Their sickness had kept them from work. Costa said she was scraping by with a monthly subsidy of 600 reais ($116) from the federal government. 
For many residents, the pandemic marks their first contact with the public health system. It is a relief for some, but can bring a gnawing anxiety as treatment means sending relatives far downriver. 
Andreza Lima de Cruz, 25, watched as doctors on a floating ambulance motored away with her father to the hospital in Portel after he tested positive for the coronavirus. 
“We know that arriving there, there’s no certainty that he’ll come back,” Lima said. “I honestly want him to stay here. But we have to think of him as well.”

The clinics had for three weeks wrangled with Vizcarra’s government over a fair rate for care. The haggling began amid reports of overcharging for the sickest patients, who require mechanical ventilators and intensive care. 
The health minister, Victor Zamora, said the agreement was finalized on Wednesday evening after a meeting with representatives of the Association of Private Clinics of Peru. 
“The important thing here is people’s health. We cannot delay treatment,” Zamora told RPP local radio. 
Peru’s coronavirus outbreak is second only to Brazil’s in Latin America, with 264,689 confirmed cases and 8,586 deaths. The pandemic has caused a deep economic crisis in the Andean country and brought its health system to the brink of collapse. 
Centrist President Vizcarra issued the ultimatum to temporarily expropriate private clinics, invoking an article in the Peruvian constitution on the use of private property in case of national public need. 
Minister Zamora said on Thursday that a flat rate of 55,000 soles ($15,580) had been agreed for the care of a COVID-19 patient. The agreement will be signed on Friday, he added. 
The government had previously proposed paying up to $1,003 per day for care, and the clinics were asking around $1,308, according to Health Ministry sources. 
Peru was one of the first in Latin America to impose, in mid-March, a quarantine to try to stop the pandemic, but since May the government has allowed the resumption of productive activity to reactivate the economy.

The NWSL becomes the first major North American league to return after the coronavirus outbreak, with eight of the league’s nine teams traveling to suburban Salt Lake City, Utah, for the competition to be played without spectators. 
“It’s sort of like a beam of light,” Portland Thorns midfielder Rocky Rodriguez said in a team video. “It’s not only going to be a nice environment for the players in the sense that we’re going to be able to play and do what we love but also for the fans.” 
The Thorns lost in the 2019 semi-finals to the Chicago Red Stars, who were defeated by the Courage in the Cary, North Carolina final in October. 
The Courage boast a stacked midfield including championship MVP Debhina and U.S. women’s national team veterans Crystal Dunn and Sam Mewis. 
“We’ve got depth, we’ve got speed, we’ve got ability, we’ve got talent,” coach Paul Riley said. “They’re very mission-driven and I think this is obviously another challenge for them.” 
The Courage play the Thorns before facing the Washington Spirit, who fell just short of last year’s playoffs but boast a strong forward line with Rose Lavelle of the U.S. national team and Ashley Hatch, the squad’s leading scorer last season. 
“It’s different, it’s something I’ve never done before, but we can get games in - any way we can do that, I’m excited to,” Hatch, a graduate of Utah’s Brigham Young University, said in a team video. 
“Any time I get a chance to play in Utah, it’s like a home away from home.” 
The Chicago Red Stars, who lost last season’s championship game 4-0, have a strong defence that includes 2019 U.S. Soccer Player of the Year Julie Ertz and keeper Alyssa Naeher, who helped the U.S. win their record fourth World Cup title in France last year. 
The Orlando Pride were forced to back out of the tournament after players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19 before departing for Utah. 
Utah Royals forward Christen Press and Thorns midfielder Tobin Heath, both U.S. national team veterans, said they would not compete in the tournament over health and safety concerns. Ballon d’Or winner Megan Rapinoe of OL Reign also skips the event, though no reason was given.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, issued guidelines on Wednesday allowing some migrant farm workers back to work as farms battle outbreaks that have killed three people and infected hundreds more. 
Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said protocols that separate COVID-19 positive and negative workers must be stringent, and workers’ health must be considered. 
“People can begin to have symptoms anytime during that incubation period and potentially can get sick fairly fast,” she said. “You need to make sure that you screen them for symptoms and enable them to stop working if they’re not feeling well.” 
Canadian farmers rely on some 60,000 temporary foreign workers predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean. Many live in crowded bunkhouses where the virus can spread quickly. 
Sudeshna Nambiar, chief operating officer of Lakeside Produce, a Leamington, Ontario greenhouse operation, welcomed the new policy. She said each employee is responsible for 23 rows in the greenhouse, allowing for ample distancing. 
Lakeside had 13 infections among workers in the spring, but all have recovered. 
“This is the new normal. This is how we have to operate, with more hygiene and social distancing,” she said. 
Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of British Columbia, said the virus is likely to spread if workers return. 
On Wednesday, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture said workers will not be forced to work. 
“This isn’t a community that has a lot of flexibility in their lives,” said Murthy. “Most individuals are not in a place where they can make a free and fair choice.” (Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by David Gregorio)"

Cochrane, a British-based journal that reviews research evidence to help decision makers adopt better health policies, looked at 54 studies, mostly from Asia, that sought to measure the reliability of tests purporting to show whether somebody has developed antibodies against the new coronavirus. 
The studies were often small, did not use the most reliable methods, and results were often incomplete, Cochrane said in its 310-page report. 
Also, most of those tested had been admitted to hospital, offering no insight into how well the tests could detect antibodies in the majority of people with milder symptoms. 
There is intense interest in these antibody tests, which rely on either a finger prick or a venous blood draw, by people eager to know whether they have had COVID-19 or not. 
There has been speculation that a positive result might mean people have some protection, at least temporarily, against re-infection. Such hopes are unrealistic, said Jon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Birmingham who leads Cochrane’s test evaluation efforts. 
“A lot of people in the UK are very interested and keen to know, but there is no decision they should be making at the moment based on the results of that test,” Deeks told reporters. 
In all, the Cochrane researchers identified data from 25 commercial COVID-19 tests, a fraction of roughly 300 such tests that exist. Their review did not include tests offered by Roche or Abbott Laboratories, which were approved by regulators after the cut-off deadline of April 27. 
Updates of Cochrane’s report plan to include data from both companies’ tests, which are now being sold by the millions in the United States and Europe. 
While the studies reviewed by Cochrane showed the antibody tests were better at detecting COVID-19 antibodies in people two or more weeks after their symptoms started, they did not provide clues as to how well they work in patients further from infection. 
Such gaps undermine the value of tests as tools in so-called “seroprevalence studies”, to determine what percentage of people in a population may have been exposed to the virus. 
“We don’t know how well these tests work beyond five weeks, so that’s our greatest concern,” Deeks said. “In seroprevalence studies, you’re looking beyond that and really we need some data which says, ‘How well do they work at three months, four months, five months.’” 
UNDER SCRUTINY 
Scientific studies’ veracity has been under scrutiny during the pandemic, more so after British medical journal The Lancet issued an apology after publishing a study on health risks from the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients that was retracted by three of its authors. 
Cochrane said that of the 54 studies it looked at that covered nearly 16,000 samples, 89% had a high risk of bias based on how participants were selected, since they were unlikely to match patient populations in clinical practice. 
There were more problems, Cochrane said, including often no mention of whether the samples were anonymized or blinded, potentially leading technicians to repeat tests if they thought they had got the wrong result. 
Some studies withheld results, while others included five or more samples per patient, resulting in inflated sample sizes and results that were falsely precise, Deeks said. 
“For many of the studies, we could never find out how many patients were included in them,” he said. “All we know is how many samples were tested.”

The World Food Programme (WFP) told a briefing in Geneva that the number of people short of essential foodstuffs had risen by 1.4 million in the past six months. 
Food prices had also soared by more than 200% in less than a year due to the freefall in neighbouring Lebanon’s economy and COVID-19 lockdown measures in Syria, WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said. 
After nine years of armed conflict, more than 90% of Syria’s population lives under the $2 per day poverty line and humanitarian needs are growing, Akjemal Magtymova, the World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in Syria, told a separate briefing. 
Fewer than half of Syria’s public hospitals are functional, whi1e half of the medical workforce has fled since the conflict began, she said, with those remaining facing a “pervasive threat of kidnapping and targeted killings”. 
Authorities have reported 248 coronavirus infections, including 9 deaths in government-held areas, while a further 5 cases and one death have been recorded by the Kurdish-led administration in the northeast, WHO figures show. 
 “The official numbers represent a likely underestimate of the true numbers, and that’s not unique to Syria at all,” said Richard Brennan, WHO’s regional emergency director. 
After a slow start, COVID-19 outbreaks in Iraq, Egypt and Turkey accelerated and the same is expected in Syria, he said. 
“What we do know in Syria is you don’t have an explosive outbreak, you can’t cover up, you can’t miss an explosive outbreak. The health facilities are not overwhelmed, so this is why we still have an opportunity to scale up our preparedness to blunt and mitigate the worst of the outbreak,” Brennan said. 
No infections have been reported in the rebel-held northwest, he said. But the heavily-populated region only has one functional laboratory and the risk of the new coronavirus spreading rapidly is high, he added.

For more than 80 years, the British Council has taught English and run libraries, cultural programmes and arts festivals in all corners of the world, becoming an influential “soft-power” extension of UK foreign policy. 
In China, large parts of south Asia, Africa and Latin America, its English courses are seen as a gold standard for achieving the fluency needed to live and work in Britain. 
But the coronavirus pandemic forced the Council to shut more than 200 examination centres and suspend teaching in much of the world, hammering its finances. Exams and class fees constitute around 60% of its 1.25 billion pound ($1.55 billion) annual revenue. 
The Treasury stepped in last week with a 60 million pound loan to tide it over, but with no clarity over how long the pandemic will last the future remains uncertain. 
“The 60 million is an intermediate step in a conversation about the longer-term needs of this organisation,” Ciaran Devane, the Council’s chief executive, told Reuters, adding that the terms of the loan were still being worked out. 
“The one year is survivable for most institutions, including our own. The longer-term answer depends to what degree things shift permanently.” 
Devane said that if the Council could get through this financial year, a longer-term financial settlement, probably involving an extended loan “would be critical”. 
Post-Brexit, as Britain seeks to exert itself as a stand-alone entity in the world, the Council has a significant role to play in promoting cultural values. 
Devane said he saw no lessening of the UK’s cultural standing post-Brexit, and the world’s desire to learn English is insatiable. But the way the British Council operates may have to change, with more online education and distance teaching. 
“The challenge going forward is not just the pandemic, it is how in a world that is more fragmented, where the conversation around values is shifting, how we continue to engage on those issues going forward,” he said."

The authorities announced on Thursday that more than 40 people living at the abandoned buildings in Mondragone, 45 km from Naples, had tested positive for COVID-19, and warned the entire town could be quarantined if the outbreak proves widespread. 
The apartment buildings were sealed off to prevent the spread of infection but footage on RAI state TV from Thursday showed a group of residents defying the order to stay put and marching through the town in protest at what they said was racist discrimination. 
Many of those living at the complex are Bulgarians working as seasonal fruit pickers in the fields around the town. Italian residents on the street chanted “Mondragone is ours” and gathered outside the sealed off are, resulting in both sides shouting abuse at each other, footage showed. 
Soldiers were manning barricades and police checks were in place on Friday around the housing complex, as residents complained they were blocked inside with little information about what was happening. 
At least 3,000 of those living in and around the occupied buildings will be tested for the coronavirus, Vincenzo De Luca, the governor of the Campania region around the town. 
Campania has been only marginally hit by the COVID-19 epidemic whose epicentre is in four northern regions which account for 70% of the roughly 240,000 cases confirmed since the outbreak was discovered at the end of February.

Instead she found herself working an office job to make ends meet. 
The coronavirus has put millions of artists around the world out of work and caused huge financial loss, particularly as some, like Rexx, are not eligible for emergency state help for the self-employed because of a lack of formal contracts. 
“Four months ago we were negotiating a tour in Asia and the release of my debut album,” Rexx, which is a stage name, told Reuters. 
The single was not released and the tour never got off the ground. She now works from home as a freelance assistant to a managing director of a firm in Brussels. 
Everything, including studio recording in Britain, is on hold, said Rexx, who declined to give her real name.   
“I have had to find other ways to make money to pay my bills,” she said while answering corporate emails on a computer screen. 
Still dressed in black and with purple hair, Rexx has returned to office work she sought to leave behind in 2014 when she tried for a career as a singer, inspired by her youth, when she sung on Belgian television aged 10. 
Her desk is far from the drama of her promotional videos where, with feathers in her hair and sparkling eye make-up, she sings both on horseback and in chains in a castle. 
But like her lyrics about the phoenix rising from the ashes, she hopes that with the easing of lockdowns across Europe from July she may be back on stage. 
“I will definitely be sending emails to promoters and bookers to let them know I am available,” she said.

As cases of the new coronavirus climb and Kenyans are told to stay home and avoid human contact, 38-year-old Omondi moves house to house through Kawangware’s maze of narrow lanes. 
Standing at the doorways of the cramped, corrugated houses, she talks about COVID-19, shows residents how to wash hands or don a mask, patiently answering their questions. 
“I know there are risks of contracting the virus, but I don’t feel so scared. I have made a pledge to keep my community safe,” said Omondi, turning to reprimand a group of children crowded around her for not maintaining social distancing rules. 
“You see how small and close together the places where we live are. We have to make sure people understand how they can stop corona from spreading. Here, if one person gets it, everyone can.” 
The mother of three is not a doctor, nurse or medic of any sort - just one of tens of thousands of ordinary African women who, without fanfare, battle the virus in their communities. 
Poorly paid or not at all, these unsung armies of mostly female community health workers have for years doled out advice and health services to families living in remote villages and urban slums who lack formal support. 
Recruited and trained by government and charities - they are found from Kenya to Tanzania, Ethiopia to Malawi, Liberia to South Africa - the women go door to door, dispensing advice on everything from family planning to immunisations. 
Now, as transmission of the new coronavirus spreads, women like Omondi are essential foot soldiers in the war on COVID-19. 
Charities such as Catholic Relief Services, which is supporting coronavirus training for about 5,000 community health volunteers in Kenya, say this workforce is key. 
“Community health volunteers are not given the recognition they deserve, but they are important frontline workers. They have a wide range of knowledge and experience from dealing with cholera outbreaks to malaria prevention,” said Moses Orinda, CRS’s senior project officer in Kenya. 
“For COVID-19, they have the ability to contact trace, provide support to home-based patients and conduct essential prevention and control activities,” Orinda said. 
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION 
The COVID-19 virus has infected close to 10 million people and killed almost half a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. 
Initially the virus multiplied more slowly in Africa than in Asia or Europe, but all 54 nations on the continent are now infected, with more than 330,000 cases and over 8,800 deaths combined, says the African Union’s Centre for Disease Control. 
South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have recorded most cases, but experts say true numbers may be much higher as many nations lack reliable diagnostic or testing capabilities. 
With densely-packed slums, poor access to water, widespread disease and weak health systems, many countries will struggle to control the fast-spreading virus, they add. 
“For now, Africa still only accounts for a small fraction of cases worldwide,” said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa director, earlier this month. 
“But the pace of the spread is quickening. Swift and early action by African countries has helped to keep numbers low, but constant vigilance is needed to stop COVID-19 from overwhelming health facilities.” 
More than half of African countries have witnessed community transmission - cases where patients have no travel history or known contact with infected people - suggesting the virus is moving undetected in the population, says WHO. 
This is not hard to believe. 
Many cities are home to sprawling, overcrowded settlements, housing tens of thousands of people, where the key to containing the spread - hand-washing and social distancing - are a luxury. 
In Kawangware, there is scant access to water or the space for self-isolation. Families of five live in one-room shacks. There is no piped water and households share toilets. 
According to the United Nations, only 14% of Kenyans have the facilities to wash their hands at home with soap and water. 
The warning from WHO is stark: up to 190,000 Africans could die if containment measures such as contact tracing, isolation, personal hygiene and distancing are not improved. 
‘INVISIBLE’ ARMIES 
Already known and respected, community health workers are a perfect first-line response to a pandemic, say health experts. 
Raj Panjabi, of Harvard Medical School and CEO of Last Mile Health, said community health workers showed their value when another deadly virus hit in Liberia. 
“When Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees, informal community providers stepped up to learn the signs and symptoms of Ebola, to team up with nurses and doctors, to go door to door to find the sick and get them into care,” he said. 
“You couldn’t have stopped the epidemic without a ground force of these community members.” 
One of their key jobs is busting myths and slaying stigmas. 
A belief that only whites get the virus or that it can be cured with hot, sweet tea is rampant, while mass testing is elusive due to the stigma a positive result can carry. 
Government health officials say the women have built up trust through years of contact so locals are happy to pay heed. 
“We know that they can pass messages on which sometimes the government cannot. They live in the same communities and have good social standing, so it is much easier for them to do provide information,” said Catherine Mugo, a sub-county community strategy coordinator at Kenya’s ministry of health. 
Mugo isn’t far wrong. 
As Omondi wends through the knot of narrow alleys that make up Kawangware, residents rush out to greet her, children give chase, and women break off from hanging washing for her advice. 
What to do if there is no money for soap? 
Borrowing a bucket, water and bleach, she shows them how to make a safe chlorine solution strong enough to kill the virus. 
Some can’t afford to buy face masks for running errands. Stay home, she orders; send out somebody who does own one. 
“Everlyne is good. She has brought us new information,” said resident Patrick Gitonga. “She has shown us new ways.” 
Health professionals and charity workers say governments need to value this workforce - to give them a living wage as well as the personal protective equipment needed to work safely. 
Omondi, who has been working as a community health volunteer for 10 years without pay and is responsible for 100 households in her neighbourhood, would welcome some recognition. 
“Having a salary or some stipend would be really useful,” said Omondi, whose five-strong family struggles to get by. 
“But you know, most of us are doing this work because we have something in (our) heart that tells us that we cannot let our neighbour suffer.”

A number of sanitary measures including testing all workers every 21 days were agreed with labor prosecutors in Minas Gerais state and with a local court, the authorities said, adding that Vale now had 15 days to draw up the details of a virus mitigation plan. 
Prosecutors will use reports the company has agreed to produce regularly to decide on possible new actions at the complex, where changes in production levels can potentially affect iron ore prices internationally. 
The Itabira complex produced almost 36 million tonnes of iron ore in 2019, according to Vale, out of the company’s total production of roughly 302 million tonnes. 
Vale reopened the mines after a coronavirus-induced lockdown on June 17, without changes in its annual production guidance. But scrutiny over the mines remains, as the death toll in Minas Gerais grows. Brazil has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases globally after the United States. 
Lawmakers were reported to be seeking to reverse the government’s declaration that mining is an “essential industry,” UBS analysts said in a note, citing a report by BNamericas. 
“We think the risk of a Minas Gerais lockdown and, in turn, the risk to Vale’s production guidance remains high,” Andreas Bokkenheuser said in a June 24 note to clients. (Reporting by Sabrina Valle; Editing by Tom Brown)"

“That number is in the correct ballpark,” IMS vice president of corporate communications Alex Damron told Reuters in an email. “Keep in mind, the vast majority of current sales represent Indy 500 ticket renewals, which occurred in the weeks following last year’s race. 
“Over the last few months, as the COVID-19 situation has developed, we have not been actively promoting our ticket sale campaign.” 
Billed as the world’s biggest single day sporting event routinely attracting estimated crowds of between 250,000 to 300,000, the sale of 175,000 tickets in a normal year would be considered worryingly low. However, in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak the number could be frighteningly high. 
Of the sports that have reopened in the wake of the pandemic, most are taking place without spectators. 
The few that have allowed fans have limited the numbers and those under very strict health and safety protocols. 
If IMS allows all those who have purchased tickets into the Brickyard, it would represent the largest gathering anywhere in the U.S. since COVID-19 forced the shutdown of North American sports mid-March. 
Regions across the United States are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. 
More than 36,000 new U.S. cases were recorded on Wednesday, a few hundred shy of the record 36,426 on April 24.

By Lisa Shumaker 
June 28 (Reuters) - Hot and sunny weather in Arizona led to crowds tubing on at least one river this weekend as that state and a dozen others face the worst surge in coronavirus cases since the pandemic started. 
Temperatures were expected to rise to over 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) on Sunday along the Salt River east of Phoenix. On Saturday, dozens of people climbed into inflatable inner tubes with coolers and took to the water to escape the heat. Very few wore masks. 
Texas shuttered tubing and rafting business on Friday and some beaches in Florida are closing again ahead of next weekend’s Fourth of July holiday to try to curb the rising outbreak in those states. 
The surge in COVID-19 cases has been most pronounced in a handful of Southern and Western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively, despite warnings by health officials to wait to see a steady decline in cases. 
For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases rose by more than 40,000, one of the largest surges in the world. In Arizona, cases have risen by 267% so far in June and jumped by a record 3,857 cases on Sunday, the eighth record-breaking increase this month. 
Even in states where cases have been declining for weeks, outbreaks are happening. One bar in East Lansing, Michigan has been linked to more than 76 cases, according to the Ingham County Health Department. That number is likely to rise, officials cautioned. 
Just a day after he sounded a note of optimism about the U.S. response to the pandemic and said the country was in “a much better place,” Vice President Mike Pence canceled events to campaign for Republican President Donald Trump’s re-election in Florida and Arizona due to the outbreak, campaign officials said on Saturday. 
In an interview with CBS, Pence said he was confident that there were enough health care supplies and capacity to deal with the spike in cases. 
He also defended Trump’s refusal to directly ask Americans to wear masks or to wear one in public himself, even as Texas Governor Greg Abbott and others say the widespread use of masks will be critical to be able to reopen the economy. 
“We believe people should wear masks wherever social distancing is not possible, wherever it’s indicated by either state or local authorities,” Pence told CBS. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has criticized the administration’s response to the pandemic that has killed more than 125,000 Americans. She told ABC News on Sunday that mandating the use of masks across the country was long overdue. 
Global coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday according to a Reuters tally, marking a major milestone in the spread of the respiratory disease that has so far killed almost half a million people in seven months.

Just two hours after she went into labour, baby Theo was born weighing just 2lb 4oz (1 kg) at the intensive care unit at Burnley General Hospital’s maternity wing in northern England. 
Father Leon Stubbs, 35, was only allowed to see Kirsty 20 minutes beforehand and after Theo’s birth, they had just an hour together before he had to go home. 
In the weeks following the stressful events in the early hours of April 20, the parents then had to take turns to visit their son as he grew stronger in an incubator. 
It was during this time that a Reuters photographer took a picture of tiny Theo with his limbs outstretched being handed to his mother by a nurse wearing gloves and mask, an image that featured prominently in British newspapers and on online news sites globally. 
It was an absolutely horrendous time, Kirsty, 33, recalled, and due to COVID-19 the family could not see him together. 
But this week, Theo - now weighing in at 6lb 4oz - was finally allowed to go home to meet his older brother, 16-month-old Arlo, for the first time in person. 
“He’s fabulous, he’s done so well,” Kirsty told Reuters as she was leaving the hospital with Theo and Leon. “Amazing, absolutely amazing - I just can’t wait for his brother to see him.” 
As staff who had looked after Theo waved them farewell, a tearful Kirsty paid tribute to what they had done for her. 
“I can’t thank them enough,” she said. “They’re here to sort the babies out but they get you through it as well. I honestly don’t have enough words to thank them, they’re amazing.”

As a mom of three kids, waitressing nights at a local restaurant in Kearney, Nebraska, the 31-year-old did not want to saddle her young family with tons of student debt. 
But then she heard about “Nebraska Promise,” a new University of Nebraska program that covers tuition for families below a certain income level. 
“I don’t think I would have considered it otherwise,” Smets said of her planned business administration degree. “I actually didn’t believe it at first.” 
Stories like Tina Smets are becoming more common in this strange coronavirus era. Facing the prospect of declining enrollment, many colleges are becoming more creative in order to attract and keep potential students. 
“Every senior leadership team is on their whiteboard right now, thinking about eight or nine or 10 different options to help more students be able to enroll,” said Jim Hundrieser, vice president for consulting services at the National Association of College and University Business Officers. 
The University of Nebraska program covers tuition for families earning less than $60,000 a year. The University of Maine is offering in-state pricing for out-of-state students whose colleges have had to shut down. 
Some schools have frozen their tuition rates, including the University of Minnesota, Colorado State and the University of Colorado. Some colleges offer discounts for students hurt by the economic crisis, such as the 30% tuition discount offered by Georgia’s Thomas University for online undergraduate programs. 
The measures are aimed at stemming a fall enrollment decline of up to 20%, according to a survey by consulting firm Simpson Scarborough. More students are considering a gap year, and the number of international students could drop through the floor. 
“Families don’t want to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year just to have their kids stay home all day,” said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research for Savingforcollege.com. 
As a result, many colleges are proving more flexible on admissions and pricing, welcome news for incoming students. Tuition and fees have rocketed more than 25% in the last decade, according to The College Board, leading to a whopping $1.6 trillion in student debt. 
“COLLEGES NEED STUDENTS” 
There are other potential silver linings. For those whose dream college might be just a bit beyond reach, this could be their lucky year. “This is going to be the best year to be admitted off the waiting list,” Kantrowitz said. “Colleges need students, and it will be easier to get in.” 
Currently, 776 colleges report having space available for the upcoming academic year, according to the College Openings Update from the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Last year? Only 422, said Kantrowitz. 
Financial aid will also be affected by the crisis. Original offers for the upcoming academic year as calculated using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)are based on financial data from 2018. 
So if your family’s financial circumstances have changed, you can appeal the award in a bid to secure more aid. 
With some colleges behind the eight-ball because of squeezed budgets, most students can take their time in order to make the right call financially. 
“Out of 4,000 institutions across the country, maybe 400 or 500 require that you make your decision by a certain date,” Hundrieser said. “But the other 3,500 are very understanding with what families are facing and want to help as you consider all your choices.” 
Hundrieser suggests that with many families wary about residential options because of the coronavirus, this might be the perfect year to opt for a low-cost community college close to home. Students could potentially transfer to their dream college later on having racked up credits in the meantime.

Victoria state reported 20 overnight cases, Victoria Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne, taking the state tally to nearly 1,900 after recording 17 on Tuesday and 16 the day before. 
The upswing in new cases in Victoria has sparked fears of a second wave, with 241 cases in the state so far identified as community transmission, an increase of eight from Tuesday. 
Authorities in Victoria, which has become the virus hotspot in Australia, have been trying to contain the spread of the virus in half a dozen suburbs in the largest city of Melbourne hit by a spike in cases. 
The state on the weekend extended its state of emergency for another month and reimposed restrictions on gatherings to stem a spike in coronavirus infections after seeing a sharp rise in daily infections. 
Despite the spike in cases in Victoria, the neighbouring state of New South Wales (NSW) said it would not introduce a hard border closure between the states. 
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, however, urged people in the state to avoid travelling to its southern neighbour. 
After enforcing restrictions early in the coronavirus outbreak compared to most other countries, Australia began to ease its lockdown last month to revive its economy after a significant slowdown in infection rates. 
Australia has so far escaped a high number of casualties from the new coronavirus, with just over 7,500 infections and 103 deaths, aided by strict lockdown measures and social distancing rules.

Federal Judge Renato Borelli ruled in a decision made public on Tuesday that Bolsonaro was subject to a fine of 2,000 reais ($387) a day if he continued to disobey a local ordinance in the federal district meant to slow the pandemic. 
Brazil’s solicitor general, which argues the government’s legal interests, said in a statement that it was studying ways to reverse the decision. 
Brazil has more confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths than anywhere outside the United States. 
On Tuesday, Brazil registered an additional 1,374 deaths from the virus and 39,436 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The novel coronavirus has killed more than 52,000 people in Brazil and infected more than 1.1 million. 
That has made the country a prime location for vaccine trials, which began over the weekend for a candidate developed by Oxford University. Brazil’s interim health minister said on Tuesday that the government would likely sign a deal this week to produce the university’s trial vaccine locally. 
On other fronts, Bolsonaro has openly defied the consensus among public health experts for slowing the outbreak. 
The president has criticized lockdown and social-distancing orders issued by governors and mayors, saying their economic damage is worse than the disease. Echoing U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has also pushed unproven anti-malarial drugs to treat the novel coronavirus. 
But his most visible defiance has been going mask-less at a string of demonstrations in Brasilia, holding babies for photos and shaking hands with supporters. 
Other officials have run afoul of the local mask rule. The country’s former education minister, who resigned last week, was fined 2,000 reais for not wearing a mask on the capital’s central boulevard earlier this month.

(Reuters) - The COVID-19 spike in California’s agricultural breadbasket is so steep that a hospital in Lodi is not accepting some patients who have other illnesses, as infections mount at nearly four times the rate called for in state guidelines for reopening the economy. 
The rapid rise of hospitalizations in San Joaquin County comes as infections from the novel coronavirus continue to soar in California, which on Monday reported a record increase of over 6,000 new cases, according to a Reuters tally. 
Throughout the United States, the virus is moving into rural areas and other places that it had not initially penetrated deeply and renewing its surge in states including Arizona and Texas where restrictions meant to slow its spread were lifted early. 
The rapid rise in San Joaquin County is mostly due to people socializing and visiting restaurants together, said Supervising Public Health Educator Daniel Kim. There are 91 people hospitalized with COVID-19, state records show, up from eight on May 21. Total cases have jumped by 903 in the past two weeks, to 2,400, county records show. 
One hospital, Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, has begun diverting patients to other facilities, Kim said. 
Hospital spokeswoman Lauren Nelson said the emergency room remains open, but non-coronavirus patients who require admission are being moved to other facilities. On Saturday, the hospital said fewer than 30 staff members had tested positive for the virus. 
With Republicans led by President Donald Trump eschewing the use of masks, the county is one of many areas across the United States where it has been difficult to persuade some residents to cover their faces. 
Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom imposed a statewide mask requirement, acting in part because local officials, including those in San Joaquin County and its most populous city, Stockton, declined to do so. The county is one of 11 that might be required to roll back reopening plans amid surges in infections or hospitalizations.

Results from a study showed the steroidal drug reduced death rates by about a third in severely ill, hospitalised COVID-19 patients, University of Oxford scientists said last week, calling it a major breakthrough. 
The results drew scepticism and optimism alike and put the focus on the availability of dexamethasone. It is at the moment mainly used to fight inflammation in other diseases. 
“We would look to ramp up further should there be a need for additional product,” Aspen CEO Saad said, without indicating current production volumes. 
As South Africa’s biggest supplier of drugs, with a 22% market share in sub-Saharan Africa, Aspen makes both the injectable and tablet forms of dexamethasone. 
The South African government asked Aspen to source the drug for overall usage in the domestic market and the African continent to help guard against the risk of scarcity if it is approved for COVID-19 treatments. 
South Africa’s health ministry last week said the government had a stock of 300,000 ampoules of dexamethasone. 
Aspen had asked the government to indicate required volumes across the continent, Saad said. “Once they give us a sense, we can work out the supply,” he added, while saying that Aspen had received orders from WHO, UNICEF and other agencies as well. 
UK’s Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK.L), with a major supply base in the United States, also said that it has seen demand for dexamethasone increase “substantially.” 
“We currently have sufficient ingredients on hand and manufacturing capacity to supply the U.S. market with dexamethasone for at least the near future,” a spokeswoman said. 
But future supply will depend on the amount of demand, availability of raw materials and the need for other essential medicines supplied by Hikma, she added, declining to give further details on production. 
WHO issued a guidance last week saying dexamethasone should be reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients. 
“A prospective meta-analysis is underway, including results of other (smaller) trials. The results will be the basis of any updates to WHO guidance,” spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson said.

The affected slaughterhouses are located in 23 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil’s third largest chicken exporter and producer. 
To date, some 4,957 meat plant workers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, for 25.14% of the state’s total 19,710 cases, the labor prosecutors said. That proportion was as high as 35% at one point, as Brazil became the world’s No. 2 hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic, behind only the United States. 
There are more than 1.1 million people infected and 51,000 deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil. 
Five employees from Rio Grande do Sul’s meatpacking plants and 12 relatives or friends of people working in the industry died due to the disease, the labor prosecutors said. 
Large meat processors like JBS SA and BRF SA operate in the region, and both had plants closed there due to outbreaks. 
The ravaging pandemic has not affected Rio Grande do Sul’s output or exports so far, according to José Eduardo do Santos, executive director at Asgav, the state’s producers association. 
He told Reuters in a recent interview that the state’s chicken exports rose by 64.5% to 281,400 tonnes between January and May, generating $403 million in the period. 
Meatpackers became hotbeds for COVID-19 contagion as employees often work at densely packed workstations in cold, virus-preserving environments. 
The meat industry employs an estimated 65,000 in Rio Grande do Sul, the labor prosecutors said.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Qualcomm expects smartphone shipments to fall 30 percent in the comings months due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company said today, cutting its previous projections for the next quarter.
Thats in addition to the 21 percent reduction in demand for phones that the company noted in the past quarter, which it reported in an earnings release this afternoon. Qualcomm did still manage to beat its Q2 revenue expectations despite that drop in demand, with Q2 revenue of $5.2 billion (compared to the projected $5.02 billion), but net income was down dramatically, dropping 29 percent year-over-year to $468 million. 
Qualcomm says there are three coronavirus-related factors that could impact sales in the coming months:
<ul><li>How the COVID-19 virus, and government policies around the world to prevent its spread, will impact business and consumer confidence</li><li>Demand for new smartphones sold by customers or licensees that use Qualcomm products</li><li>The state of the global wireless supply chain, distribution networks, and workforces </li></ul>The company also also cites other, non-coronavirus-related factors that may impact its revenue in the company quarter, including its licensing dispute with Huawei, network rollouts, and its dependance on a small number of customers and licensees and the premium-tier device segment of the market. 
Despite the expected drop in demand for new devices, Qualcomm is still sticking to its original estimate for 5G devices shipped in 2020, with the company expecting to see 175 million and 225 million 5G phone shipments this year. The nascent 5G market is a big part of Qualcomms business, with the companys modems serving as some of the only viable options for device manufacturers to support the next-generation network to the point where Apple was forced to settle its ongoing disputes with the company in order to get access to those modems for its upcoming 5G iPhones."

General Motors is delaying the upcoming reveal of the new all-electric Hummer truck, which was originally scheduled for May 20th because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker isnt yet offering a replacement date for the launch of the new electric vehicle, but it says that the production schedule isnt currently affected. The new Hummer is due out in late 2021. 
GM announced back in January that it was resurrecting the Hummer as a 1,000-horsepower electric truck under its GMC brand, and it teased it in a Super Bowl ad starring LeBron James. The vehicle line, which became synonymous with the excess of enormous gas-guzzling SUVs, was retired in 2010 as the automakers recovered from the financial crisis. The new EV version will be built at GMs Detroit-Hamtramck factory, which the automaker is retrofitting to make electric and autonomous vehicles. 
The new Hummer EV is just one of a slew of electric vehicles that GM is working on as part of a more than $20 billion push into the space. The company detailed that plan at its first EV Day in March. 
Automakers around the world have delayed events and product launches, shut down factories, and even pivoted to making ventilators and other critical equipment as the novel coronavirus turned into a pandemic. The worlds biggest auto shows have also been canceled or postponed.

 In January, early reports out of China started to hint that people infected with the coronavirus were contagious before they started to show symptoms. That’s unusual for a respiratory virus like this one, and it worried public health experts all over the world: it’s much harder to control the spread of a disease if someone who has it can pass it along before they know they’re sick.
It’s since become clear that, yes, it’s possible for people who don’t feel sick to infect other people. What scientists still don’t know, though, is how often it happens. And that matters for managing the pandemic: if only a few people spread COVID-19 when they’re symptom-free, missing them probably won’t have a big impact on the course of the pandemic. If most people do, though, it’s more important to track them all down. 
For months, there have been regular dust-ups over just how likely it is for people without symptoms to spread COVID-19. The latest quarrel stemmed from vague comments by a World Health Organization expert at a press conference. After the expert suggested that asymptomatic transmission was “very rare,” the organization eventually stated that they just don’t have enough information yet. Getting a clear answer will be hard. It takes careful, meticulous detective work to figure out how often people carry the virus without symptoms and how likely they are to pass it onto others when they feel healthy. 
It takes careful, meticulous detective work

That’s been done a handful of times in the past few months, says Mark Slifka, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University studying viral immunology. But it’s not enough, and we need far more data to settle the debate. 
No symptoms — yet
The confusion started in January when a report in The New England Journal of Medicine said that a German businessman had caught COVID-19 from a colleague visiting from Shanghai. The colleague, the report said, didn’t have any symptoms while she was in Germany. Some experts took that report as the first sign that someone without symptoms (the Shanghai woman) could pass the coronavirus on to someone else (her German colleague). 
It turned out, though, that she did have mild symptoms: she felt a bit feverish and tired, with minor aches, during those meetings. 
The first challenge researchers face around virus spread from people with no symptoms is reflected in the NEJM mistake: it’s hard to tell if someone truly does not have any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they just have very mild symptoms. Some signs of COVID-19 might be easy to brush off, and someone with a slight tickle in their throat might not think that they’re sick. If scientists are trying to find out if someone with a positive test is symptomatic or not, they often rely on that person to say how they feel. Those self-reported symptoms may not be accurate.
If someone truly does not have symptoms, the next step is checking to see if they ever end up developing them. Many studies of COVID-19 cases check in on people just once, when they initially test positive. If those people don’t feel sick, they can sometimes get classified as “asymptomatic.” Many of them, though, eventually end up developing symptoms later on, which scientists classify as “pre-symptomatic.” 
“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’”

“We should not use the term ‘asymptomatic’ unless you come back at least 14 days later and ask that person, ‘Are you still okay?’” Slifka says. 
In order to get good data on the number of people with the coronavirus who really, truly never feel sick, researchers have to track them for at least 14 days. (The latest people usually get sick after exposure to the virus.) Without that long-term information, the data is no good, said Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Saint Andrews, and other researchers in an open letter. 
Infectious or just infected
Once scientists have that long-term data, they can start checking to see how often asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people actually infect others. Studies show that people have high levels of the virus in their throats before they develop symptoms. People who never ended up developing symptoms also had copies of the virus floating around in their noses and throats, one study found, but at lower levels than people who eventually felt sick. 
Those studies show that people without symptoms could, theoretically, pass an infection onto someone else. They have copies of the virus in their nose and throat, and those virus copies could make their way over to another person through droplets of spit or the occasional sneeze. That doesn’t mean, though, that they actually will. The amount of virus in a person’s nose is still just an indirect way to measure how contagious they are, Slifka notes. “It doesn’t mean they’re a good spreader.” 
Someone who doesn’t feel sick probably isn’t coughing or sneezing, for example, says Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response. “One may argue that once symptoms start, and you’re coughing more, and you’re expelling more respiratory droplets, that that may increase your transmission,” he says. 
Information on the amount of virus floating around in people without symptoms and estimates on how many respiratory droplets they produce can be used to estimate how they could spread the virus. Those are just models, though, and they don’t directly answer the question. Finding out, conclusively, if anyone actually caught COVID-19 from someone without symptoms requires detailed tracking and even more testing. 
If a group of people is being tested regularly — like in a sports league, for example — it’s easier to re-create the order in which an infection passed from one person to another and when that happened, Karan says. “If this player became positive on this day, and then played in a game, and these other players became positive on days four and five, you can really trace it,” he says. 
Re-creating events within a household where everyone was only tested once is harder. If two members of a family test positive on the same day, and one has symptoms and the other does not, it’s impossible to know which direction the virus spread. 
researchers also have to exclude all other ways people could have possibly gotten sick

In order to say a person got sick because of someone else who tested positive but didn’t have symptoms, researchers also have to exclude all other ways they could have possibly gotten sick, noted Natalie Dean, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida, on Twitter. That’s hard to do in places with high rates of infection. If the virus is circulating through a community, that person could have picked it up by touching a doorknob in a public place or at the supermarket, for example. 
A few research groups have managed to sort through all the clutter. One such study followed people who contracted the virus while working at a call center in South Korea. During the investigation, some workers had symptoms, some developed symptoms later, and some never developed symptoms. No one who came into contact with the workers when they did not have symptoms ended up catching the virus. Another detailed study that carefully traced the path of infection for 157 people with COVID-19 in Singapore found that only 10 were infected by someone who hadn’t yet developed symptoms. 
No good answers
That early data suggests that, even if they have the virus in their nose, people who don’t have symptoms yet or who never get symptoms spread the coronavirus less frequently than people with symptoms. The studies are small, though, and aren’t enough to say for sure who is or isn’t likely to spread COVID-19. 
They also don’t change what scientists know: some people do spread the coronavirus before they develop symptoms or without developing symptoms at all. Before there’s more evidence, that’s enough for public health experts to recommend that everyone wear masks, even if they feel fine, in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. “We have to play it as conservatively as possible,” Karan says. 
“We have to play it as conservatively as possible.”

The coronavirus is still very new, and scientists still have a lot to learn about it. 
“We’re still figuring this out, we don’t have complete certainty on the exact amount of spread from pre-symptomatic cases, or asymptomatic, or symptomatic,” Karan says. “That’s why, while we’re still learning about the proportion of transmission by these different groupings, that we wear masks in high risk situations very consistently.”
While we’re taking those steps, researchers should keep searching for better data, Slifka says. In areas with low rates of COVID-19, public health officials can do the detailed contact tracing necessary to figure out if someone caught the virus from someone without symptoms. The more testing states and cities do, the more likely they are to find the people who are walking around carrying the virus without any symptoms. 
“We should be monitoring each of the cases, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic and symptomatic, and checking for that secondary attack rate,” Slifka says. “Then we’ll have an answer.”"

 Massive PPE shortages pushed DIY volunteers to get creative On March 20th, as the coronavirus situation in New York City hurtled toward full-blown crisis, Madiha Choksi was packing a taxi with two Flashforge 3D printers and as much filament as she could fit. 
Choksi, a librarian specializing in research and educational technology, had received an urgent email the night before from Pierre Elias, a cardiology fellow at NYP-Columbia University Medical Center. Elias desperately needed to produce more protective gear for hospital workers treating COVID-19 patients. He hoped Choksi, the administrator for Columbia University’s 3D printing lab, might be able to help. 
“The email was very long and really concerning,” Choksi tells The Verge. Normally, she could help. “But I don’t have any printers,” she remembers thinking, “and we were already on day three or four of remote work.”
“The email was very long and really concerning.”

Thankfully, Columbia handed over its printers. “Within hours, they were like, ‘Yeah, of course,’” she says. Choksi got to work in her apartment producing prototype face shields by modifying an open-source design, from a company called Budmen Industries, and 3D printing the plastic visor that holds the shield and rests on the forehead with a piece of foam-like material in between. She used supplies purchased from Staples to slap together about six units she then handed off to Elias a day after receiving the email from the doctor. 
“He took them straight to the hospital and tested them out,” she says, “and he came back and said, ‘Can we have 1,000 more?’”

The US continues to struggle to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, both at a state and federal level. So DIY efforts from academics, hobbyists, manufacturing experts, and professional firms have coalesced around COVID hotspots like New York City to meet the needs of health care workers and others on the front line of the response effort. 
Some of these initiatives are highly organized, involving partnerships across state lines to source materials and make use of industrial-grade manufacturing facilities. Yet almost all began in the living rooms of people with access to a 3D printer and the ingenuity to put together stopgap measures as existing supply lines struggled to keep up.
“In a perfect world, we have coordination across the nation, where we have hotspots and we focus the resources there so the health care workers are protected and patients are protected. And as that dies down, we ship what remains to the next location,” says James Hudspeth, an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University and a COVID response lead at Boston Medical Center.
“The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth.”

That ideal world is far from reality. Face shields, which Hudspeth says are rarely used in standard medical environments outside surgeries and very select procedures, ended up being second in demand only to face masks, which have also been in short supply. “One way people get infected is by touching surfaces and then touching the face or mask. The shield acts as a reminder you shouldn’t touch your eyes and shouldn’t touch your mouth,” Hudspeth explains.
The problem is that shields are only made by a limited number of manufacturers, some domestic but many overseas. And large manufacturers only ship units in batches based on orders from procurement offices of large medical institutions and local and state governments. 
“We have a central supply, and some of the states have the supply. But there isn’t the capacity to dictate where privately produced or purchased stuff is going,” Hudspeth says. “States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.” That’s left doctors, nurses, and health care workers across the nation scrambling to get as much PPE as they can, regardless of where it comes from. 
“States are battling each other for these supplies, and every hospital in the country is doing the same thing.”

A face shield of the DIY variety typically consists of a molded or printed plastic semi-circle visor, sometimes called a bracket, that is attached often by glue to a piece of foam that rests on the forehead. The unit then attaches to a long sheet of transparent plastic film that sits just above the face. 
Everything is held together with a rubber band or a similar elastic device. It’s a simple way to protect someone’s face when interacting with a potentially COVID-positive patient. These shields can be cheaply manufactured, easily sanitized, and then reused. They also aren’t as complicated or bound by regulatory restrictions as, say, respiratory face masks. 
The lack of regulations surrounding face shields have made them an attractive option for manufacturers large and small looking for a way to pitch in. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced in early April that his company would produce tens of millions of face shields for California health care workers, and Apple’s website now features a tutorial for assembling the units.

In the Pacific Northwest, Nike, which has its headquarters just outside Portland, has repurposed materials and manufacturing processes for its running shoes to produce face shields, too. Countless other companies, from Jeff Bezos-funded rocket outfit Blue Origin to Alphabet’s life sciences division Verily, are putting resources toward emergency face shield production. 
The efforts aren’t stopping at just shields but extending to face masks and even ventilators, too. Razer, the gaming accessory maker, even built its own automated face mask production line in Singapore, equipped with vending machines for dispensing them around the city-state. 
It doesn’t hurt that out of all the PPE in short supply during COVID-19, face shields are among the easiest to produce — a single unit can be constructed with basic materials by anyone with a 3D printer or even a laser or waterjet cutter. “The nice thing about shields is that they’re easy to produce relatively quickly,” Hudspeth says. “People who have larger 3D printers and a relatively basic piece of plastic that is flexible enough to bend can make a face shield.” 
Nearly two months after she’d received that first, frantic email, Choksi and her fellow Columbia University librarians Alex Gil and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira now run a DIY volunteer effort called COVID Maker Response. So far, the group has assembled more than 19,000 face shields and distributed units to over 50 institutions, including hospitals, clinics, fire departments, and other groups of first responders. 
The operation now has an almost factory-like scale and sophistication. They moved from Choksi’s apartment to the 92nd Street Y, a historic community center in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. They have two official manufacturing partners: 3D printing design firm Tangible Creative, out of Newark, New Jersey, and Brooklyn-based 3D printer creator MakerBot. 
Both firms supply the single 3D-printed visor to which the shield attaches. After receiving the parts in large batches, Choksi has a group of 10 to 12 volunteers, mostly medical students, on four-hour shifts assembling the shields and ferrying them by taxi or car to hospitals.

Gil and de Sá Pereira, both data librarians and scholars specializing in areas like data visualization and digital mapping, have experience in rapid crisis response through their academic careers. Now, Gil handles incoming face shield requests and spends all day in communication with hospitals. And de Sá Pereira is helping manage the operation’s resources and ensuring they’re using Columbia’s funding as efficiently as possible. The rest of their limited free time is spent helping other groups in the US and overseas start their own DIY operations. 
“When this whole thing hit, first and foremost in most of our minds was the lack of PPE, which was pretty harrowing in those early days,” says Jason Hill, an emergency room doctor at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “In particular, I had a pretty crazy overnight very early on where I had to intubate,” he says, referring to the insertion of a tube into the body, “in the middle of the night without one of the face shields. It was early on and nobody was expecting the onslaught to be that intense at the time, and we burned through our entire stash during the day.”
Uptown at the Harlem Hospital Center, Stephen Nicholas, a doctor who came out of retirement to help treat patients during COVID-19, watched as the PPE shortage was fast becoming a crisis of its own. 
“After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly.”

“I cannot tell you how horrible it was,” he says of the situation in late March. His hospital began using a special emergency code, “777 Gold,” over the loudspeaker when a COVID-19 patient had entered respiratory arrest and needed staff attention immediately. The “gold” was to tell hospital workers to wear appropriate PPE due to the heightened risk of infection, but the building was burning through its stash of face masks at an alarming rate. “There were periods every 20 minutes you would hear overhead, ‘777 Gold.’” 
Nicholas, a former professor at Columbia, heard about Choksi’s efforts through his daughter, a medical student at the school. Gil began helping the doctor coordinate face shield deliveries for his colleagues. “After the first distribution, they were all gone instantly,” Nicholas says. “Second batch was 200. I was out of those in a day and a half. Next was 500, and that lasted about two days.” He says the PPE shortage is no longer as much an issue now that most workers have their own shields they can sanitize and hold onto. 
Hill, the ER doctor, also found his way to Choksi’s group through word of mouth. He says, as the crisis accelerated, every doctor became acutely aware that acquiring more PPE as fast as possible would be crucial to keeping health care workers safe. COVID Maker Response is now helping supply his hospital with hundreds of these shields every week. 
“Every few days, I’ll gauge the needs for our particular ERs and ICUs with some colleges and we’ll swing by and get a box of 200 or so of these face shields to drop off,” he says. “When I walk through the ER, the vast majority of people I see are wearing these face shields. At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.” 
“At this point it really feels like we have a surplus, which is a wonderful thing to feel.”

COVID Maker Response is far from the only operation like this. Choksi and Gil tell me they’ve been in contact with at least three others around New York City alone, and they continue to field messages from others around the country and even overseas that are interested in doing the same. 
Countless groups have also spun up elsewhere in the US, typically around schools and libraries with the space and resources to set up these makeshift factories. Some, like the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub and the Illinois PPE Network, have taken similar approaches to coordinating massive, factory-like volunteer efforts that employ individuals in their homes all the way to corporate partners and universities. 
“Part of our model is not to become the one supplier of face shields,” says Gil. “The idea of this grassroots, distributed model is to help others be able to do what you’re doing so many more distributed teams can aggregate to some kind of impact. This is of course in the absence of industry or city stepping in.”

One hurdle facing the PPE-producing projects is knowing when to shut them down, as more conventional manufacturing methods continue to ramp up. Choksi and Gil say they’re still receiving daily requests for more face shields, and shortages will continue so long as the novel coronavirus continues to overwhelm the US health care system and its hospital and other frontline workers. 
“I think we’re just going to keep going until the need dies down,” Choksi says. “There’s so many other efforts we’re hearing about, and until we stop receiving requests, our plan is to just keep at it. Full speed ahead until the needs are met.”
For Choksi and her partners at COVID Maker Response, the willingness for her volunteers and partners to keep helping has been one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise awful and often grim situation. She says the maker community and 3D printing in general have shown that they can fill gaps and help vulnerable communities in times of need, using their expertise and ingenuity.

 From left to right, the core volunteer group has consisted of Jess Ho, Rin Allen, Elisa Mala, Joe de Jonge, Madiha Zahrah Choksi, Rajat Sethi, Matt Car, Victoria Colozzi, and Cullen O Brown.

 


“I think the situation has really shown what 3D printing is capable of, which is not long-term mass production, but filling a need for very rapid production, on-demand and highly customized items,” says Dave Veisz, MakerBot’s vice president of engineering, who now works closely with COVID Maker Response on the volunteer effort. “[COVID-19] has just shown the vulnerability in the global supply chain. The fact that these parts are needed so badly has been eye-opening, as well as the fact that a lot of these parts only come from a handful of factories.”
Veisz says that under normal circumstances, you would just injection mold a face shield design and have a factory spin up to mass produce it. “But these things take months,” he says. “It’s been eye-opening to the general public that 3D printing can be used as a stopgap for emergency needs like this and can be used to kickoff production for the item.”
Choksi says the novel coronavirus has been the kind of situation the maker community prides itself on coming together to fight. “It’s very organized and mobilized and fast moving and constantly iterating. If there is an emergency, a need for crisis response, there is a file out there that is open source, readily available for everyone,” she says. “We’re just humbled and grateful to put our wits and expertise to it and just go.”"

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Amazon is reopening its six distribution centers in France beginning today, according to a reporter from CNN. The company shut down the warehouses in April due to a labor dispute with workers who alleged that the internet retailer wasnt doing enough to protect them from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The six warehouses are set to gradually reopen starting today, according to an Amazon spokesperson speaking to CNN. 
Amazon closed all six of its French warehouses on April 15th after a French court issued a ruling that threatened to fine the company 1 million per item for shipping out anything other than medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. 
The court ruling came after a complaint from French unions representing Amazons workers who argued that the warehouses were too crowded and that Amazon wasnt doing enough to protect them from the virus. Amazon argued that its operations were complex and varied and that the the risk was too high to try to only ship products that met the court ruling hence the total shutdown for the past month. 
A statement posted by the CFDT Services union gives more details on the agreement, which includes health guarantees, a voluntary return to work for workers, adjusted schedules to help with distancing, and increased pay of 2 per hour through the end of May. 
Despite reopening in France, Amazon continues to struggle with safe work conditions for its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there have been seven known COVID-19 deaths of employees at Amazon warehouses. The company is also being frustratingly opaque about how many workers have actually been infected or died from the virus, with Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark calling statistics on infections not a particularly useful number. Amazon has also fired some of its employees who staged a walkout over safety concerns, which led to a senior engineer and vice president resigning from the company in protest."

The problem is that they've not been easily accessible in one searchable database, which means it might take callers or texters reaching out for help longer to find the resources they need. 
A new website launched Tuesday by the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition aims to change that. Its goal is to make mental health support a click away for people who are struggling with their emotional and mental wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The ability to access mental health crisis services is critical at this time, yet COVID-19 is impacting the typical ways people receive help in a crisis,"" Travis Atkinson, president of the Crisis Residential Association and co-chair of the American Association of Suicidologys Crisis Services Committee, said in a statement.  
Atkinson noted that emergency rooms, where patients might seek care for suicidal thinking and behavior or a panic attack, are focused on treating COVID-19 patients. At the same time, psychiatric hospitals are decreasing their capacity in order to follow social distancing guidelines. ""[P]eople need to know how to access available mental health services,"" Atkinson said.
The new site debuted with a database of crisis services searchable by state, contact method, support type, topics, and categories. Someone in New York, for example, could search for text-based services staffed by counselors with experience talking about anxiety. In addition to anxiety, topics include bullying, gambling, parenting, and substance use. There are several categories that focus on demographics like gender, veteran status, age, and sexuality. 
Example of a search on the Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition website.

The database includes contact information for hundreds of helplines and community centers, whose volunteers and staff are trained to connect callers with local mental health providers and resources. The site also includes articles on coping with the effects of COVID-19, tips for how to help a loved one, and information specifically for frontline workers who want mental health support. 
The Pandemic Crisis Services Coalition is a group of international mental health organizations that banded together in March in order to create the site. Its members include Crisis Text Line, the American Association of Suicidology, The Trevor Project, and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 
If you want to talk to someone or are experiencing emotional distress, you can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline by calling 1-800-985-5990 or texting TalkWithUs to 66746.

However, Colleen Tressler, Consumer Education Specialist at the FTC, is warning that scammers are now using contact tracing as a cover for targeting consumers via their mobile devices.
Getting in touch with people who have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 is usually initiated via a text message. But in a post on the FTC website, Tressler warns, ""scammers, pretending to be contact tracers and taking advantage of how the process works, are also sending text messages. But theirs are spam text messages that ask you to click a link.""
Sure enough, if you don't spot the scam and click the link you're likely taking the first step towards having unwanted software installed on your device. After that, your personal and financial details are vulnerable to being stolen. With that in mind, the FTC is telling everyone to ""Don't take the bait,"" remain vigilante, and take action to protect themselves. That means filtering out text messages from unknown senders if you can, enabling two-factor authentication on all online accounts that offer the feature, and always installing the latest available updates for your device(s).

Unveiled on Wednesday, the Fitbit Flow is an ""easy-to-use, and low-cost"" emergency ventilator designed in consultation with healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients. Based on manual resuscitator bags used by paramedics, the ventilator features various sensors to help monitor patients, and allows the pressure and volume of oxygen delivery to be controlled. The Fitbit Flow also has a clear window through which healthcare workers can view the automated resuscitator bag being pumped.
It isn't a long-term solution conventional ventilators are still sorely needed. Instead, the Fitbit Flow is intended to act as a temporary stopgap keeping patients alive until they can be put on a standard machine.
""We know from some conversations that physicians are already trying to work out the ethics in deciding who gets the ventilator and who doesnt, due to shortage of supply,"" said Dr. Tony Faranesh, a Fitbit research scientist who helped develop the ventilator. ""The goal here is to support life in the event that ones not available until one might become available.""
The FDA has already authorised the Fitbit Flow for emergency use during the pandemic where conventional ventilators aren't available. 
The Fitbit Flow has a modular stand, enabling it to be used with O2 tanks of various sizes.

Fitbit has stated it intends to use its existing infrastructure to quickly manufacture ""large volumes"" of these devices. The company has no plans to continue manufacturing ventilators after the current health crisis passes though this is only a temporary shift in focus.
""COVID-19 has challenged all of us to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity, and use everything at our disposal to more rapidly develop products that support patients and the healthcare systems caring for them,"" said Fitbit CEO James Park.
""We saw an opportunity to rally our expertise in advanced sensor development, manufacturing, and our global supply chain to address the critical and ongoing need for emergency ventilators and help make a difference in the fight against this global virus.""

 (CNN)On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that it would wind down the White House coronavirus task force. Confirming this to CNN, a senior White House official said the task force ""will be phased down around Memorial Day.""
This came as a shock, as the University of Washington's model, which the White House seemed to trust, predicted deaths in the US to be almost twice as high as it previously estimated, with the daily toll rising to nearly 3000 by the beginning of June. 
Luckily, President Donald Trump seemed to change course on Wednesday, tweeting that ""the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.""
This tweet is a huge relief to those of us who appreciate the benefit of having a task force in times of crisis. Disbanding it would have been a dangerous move that would have made it even harder to contain this virus in the weeks and months to come. 
Here's why the task force is vital: 
We are battling fatigue and complacency 
Though we are far from being out of the woods, we are already battling fatigue and increasing complacency when it comes to the virus. State and local leaders are under extreme pressure to reopen their communities and some have made concessions to relax restrictions whether they meet the criteria suggested by the White House or not. 
When the White House coronavirus task force let the national social distancing guidelines expire on April 30, and provided only the less stringent state guidance for reopening, it sent an implied message that the situation has improved enough that there is no need for further federal direction and the rest is up to the states. 
Winding down the task force would have entirely reinforced this message and left state leaders with even less top cover. It would have also signaled that the virus is no longer a top priority, which could have made it harder for some state leaders to emphasize that the virus is a very real and ongoing threat.
Coordination and decision-making are crucial right now
Effective coordination and communication between federal agencies -- and between federal and state agencies -- has been an ongoing challenge throughout this crisis. 
This is not a new phenomenon. Having served in leadership positions in both federal and state government, I can attest to how difficult it is to achieve seamless cooperation among the most competent and well intended public servants even in the best of times. Often, agencies will have different ideas about how to solve a problem -- and someone at a higher level needs to make a decision quickly about how to move forward. 
That's why in the event of an emergency or crisis it often takes the formation of a task force or similar command structure to bring together disparate agencies to share information, clarify roles, and work together towards a common purpose. In the absence of this, agencies tend to quickly default to working in siloes. One of the reasons testing has been such a difficult nut to crack is because it is so dependent on collaboration and coordination between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state and local governments, and the private sector. Dissolving the task force would have made this even harder.
Covid-19 spreads at a frightening speed
The speed of viral spread is one aspect that makes Covid-19 difficult to contain. On March 5th, there were 12 deaths due to Covid-19 in the US. Nine weeks later, there have now been over 71,000 deaths.
At every point along the way, the virus has moved faster than our ability to contain it. Speed and agility are not often strengths of government agencies. Concerns over shortages of resources, like the protective personal equipment needed by medical personnel, were not taken seriously enough by leaders who could have prioritized acquiring the necessary supplies.
As anyone who has worked in government knows, there is a chain of command. Important decisions often must be approved by agency leaders or the White House. These processes are typically slow and it is all too easy for key insights or pieces of information to get lost along the way, even unintentionally. That's why a task force structure that allows for subject matter experts to come together, share information and brief political leaders is most efficient way to inform decision making during a time of crisis. 
The crucial importance of how we observe Memorial Day
As more states loosen restrictions, we may be entering an even more dangerous phase of this pandemic, potentially setting ourselves up for serious outbreaks across the country.
Hokkaido, Japan, provides a perfect example of what can happen if lockdowns are lifted too early. According to TIME, in late February, the island had the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all prefectures in Japan. 
On February 28, the governor declared a state of emergency, closed schools and encouraged people to stay at home.
Many restaurants and businesses also closed. By mid-March, the situation had turned the corner; the health crisis largely stabilized and pressure from businesses to reopen began to grow. In response, on March 19, the governor of Hokkaido lifted the state of emergency but asked residents to continue social distancing and stay home if they felt sick.
Unfortunately, the announcement came just before a three-day weekend, when many residents ventured out to celebrate the lifting of the restrictions. As TIME reported, Dr. Kiyoshi Nagase, chairman of the Hokkaido Medical Association, believes this likely started a second wave of infections in Hokkaido. On April 14, 26 days later, the governor announced a second state of emergency and reimposed restrictions. 
The upcoming Memorial Day weekend in the US is not only a national holiday to honor those who have died in military service, but it is also the start of the summer season. Many Americans will be planning travel and recreational activities for that weekend which could lead to further spread of the virus. By then, some states will also have relaxed restrictions for weeks, enough time for an outbreak to have surfaced, assuming that testing is in place to detect one fast enough.
It is entirely possible that the continuation of the task force will lead to new national guidelines for protective measures as the summer starts. We can only hope that this is the case, otherwise we may find ourselves facing a second wave of the pandemic -- and countless more deaths to come."

Ulster County health officials are searching for anyone who may have had their haircut at the barbershop over the last three weeks, a statement from the county says. Kingston is located roughly 90 miles north of New York City.
""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease and learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening,"" said Dr. Carol Smith, the health commissioner for Ulster County, in a statement.
County health officials are recommending anyone who received a haircut at the shop on Broadway during the past three weeks to get tested for the coronavirus. 
""This kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" Smith said.
There are currently 1,563 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ulster County and 64 fatalities, according to the county. People who came in contact with the Kingston barbershop should contact the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health.
According to directives from state Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons or other personal hygiene services had to remain closed.
Speaking about this particular case on Thursday, Cuomo said hairstyling is by definition an up-close and personal occupation and so it would be part of phase two of reopening. 
NYC contact tracing efforts
Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says hundreds of people have been trained to begin contact tracing and will start work in the coming days.
New York City will have 1,000 contact tracers by the end of the month, and by the beginning of June they plan to get up to 2,500 trained individuals, according to de Blasio. It would then build as needed to potentially go up to as many as 10,000 tracers.
The effort is being led by NYC Health and Hospitals. The contact tracers will investigate cases, trace and monitor contacts, and manage all case data and inquiries. This would allow the city to immediately isolate and care for those who test positive for the virus, and then rapidly track, assess, and quarantine anyone they came into contact with who they may have infected, according to a NYC Health and Hospitals press release.
The effort is ""bigger, more complex and a much greater operational challenge than anything we've seen in the history of contact tracing in this city,"" the mayor said. The Department of Health and their expertise are being brought in for ""maximum impact,"" he added.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)The concern was that Covid-19 would overwhelm the medical care system with patients. While that has happened in some hot spots, the broader picture is just the opposite: Covid-19 has deprived the system of patients. 
Some of these would-be patients have surely been hurt: having either shied away or been told to stay away from interventions that would have helped them live longer and/or live better. For others the delay may not matter; they will do equally well with intervention at a later date. But it is important to consider another possible outcome: some do better with less medical care. 
No one has national data yet, but the turn of events is remarkable. 
In mid-March hospitals began to cancel elective surgeries both to protect patients and to provide surge capacity, following guidance from the American College of Surgeons. This not only halted hernia repairs and joint replacements, but also surgeries for low-risk cancers -- specifically, early stage breast and prostate cancer.
Next, emergency care unexpectedly plummeted. Emergency rooms in Boston, Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul saw substantial drops in volume, and ER doctors are experiencing cuts to both their hours and pay. The decline in volume doesn't appear to be confined to fewer minor injuries and self-limited illnesses, it also includes fewer heart attacks and strokes.
But the impact of Covid-19 goes well beyond the hospital to include all physician/patient encounters. Despite the advent of telehealth, primary care practices are seeing fewer patients and laying off staff. The American Academy of Family Physicians estimates that about 40% of family medicine clinics are at risk of closing by the end of June -- more than doubling the number of US counties with a significant shortfall in health care providers at the end of March. 
Given fewer outpatient visits, one downstream effect is wholly expected: fewer lab tests and X-rays. This limits efforts to find disease early in asymptomatic individuals. Most notably, cancer screening has been effectively shut down.
What can we learn from this cataclysmic disruption in medical intervention? 
Previous research on the global effects of doctor strikes suggests that overall mortality either remains stable -- or, in fact, declines. Clearly, it will be important to carefully study 2020 mortality trends and disentangle Covid-related deaths from other causes of death. It will be equally important to distinguish the well-off from the poor: we may find that medical care disruption decreases mortality among the well-off, yet increases mortality among the poor.
While analysis of overall mortality is important, so, too, is looking into more granular topics. The disruption in elective surgeries should lead us to reevaluate the necessity of those surgeries and their associated risks. There are opportunities to look at still finer detail: In our hospitals (Brigham and OHSU), for example,women with early-stage breast cancer are having their surgeries delayed and are instead being started on hormonal therapy. Maybe we will learn that some women don't need surgery.
Suspending cancer screening is another important area to study. There is little doubt, for example, that the decline in mammography will lead to fewer breast cancers diagnosed. But is that a bad thing or good thing? 
One opportunity is to study what happens to US cancer statistics when screening is resumed. One of two observations are possible. Rates of breast cancer might catch up: meaning the deficit in cancers during the pandemic would be matched by a surplus of cancers in subsequent years. In other words, all the cancers that sat undetected in patients during the pandemic would be eventually found. The alternative would be that breast cancer diagnoses never catch up. 
Years ago, researchers observed this phenomenon in Norway. Women, ages 50-64, who underwent three mammograms over six years had more invasive breast cancers found compared to similar women who had a single mammogram at the end of six years. Delayed mammography led to less breast cancer diagnoses and the deficit never caught up -- despite a mammogram at the end of six years. These findings suggest that some small cancers regress on their own. Might this be happening right now during the Covid-19 pandemic?
The decline in heart attack and strokes raises equally important questions in cardiovascular disease. Some patients may have been reluctant to come to the hospital and suffered, perhaps even died, at home. However, what ""counts"" as a heart attack or stroke has expanded over the years. An alternative explanation may be that doctors are no longer diagnosing patients with very mild cardiac or neurologic abnormalities. Perhaps what is being missed are painless, minor events for which treatment is unneeded -- or even harmful. 
It's also possible that there are genuinely fewer heart attacks and strokes occurring right now. Smog is disappearing in Los Angeles and, in India, people can see the Himalayas from miles away for the first time in 30 years. Air pollution has been consistently linked to heart attacks. And ""hunkering down"" has meant slowing down for many. Has better air and lifestyle helped our hearts?
After Covid-19, if we dare imagine the day, it will be important to ask who was harmed by delayed and forgone medical care. But the severe financial strains on individuals and public budgets make it just as essential to ask who benefited from avoiding interventions with no salutatory effect. 
But we won't find the benefits unless we look for them. We need physician researchers willing to ask hard questions about services they deliver -- questions that may threaten their own professional/financial self-interests. 
Covid-19 provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to study what happens when the well-oiled machine of medical care downshifts from high to low volume in order to focus on acutely ill patients. It will be comfortable for physician researchers to study what was lost. It will be courageous for them to study what was gained."

The government said it would take over costs for all virus and antibody tests, and would simplify the system for testing, effective from Thursday, the same day when an app to alert individuals potentially exposed to the virus will go live. 
Switzerland’s restrictions have been eased in recent weeks, with shops and schools reopening, along with restaurants - although with limits on the number of people allowed to be present. 
Until now, coronavirus tests were partly paid for by the regional governments and individual health insurance schemes, meaning some people had to pay themselves. 
“This scheme has meant that not all patients have been treated the same,” the government said. “There has been a danger that people are not being tested when they have to pay for it themselves.” 
It said it would pay 169 Swiss francs ($178.72) for virus tests and 113 francs for antibody tests. 
So far 1,682 people have died in Switzerland from COVID-19. 
While the country’s infection rate has slowed, with 31,376 people testing positive for the virus, new infections ticked up on Wednesday, according to figures from the Federal Office of Health, with 44 more cases than the day before. 
The government also on Wednesday approved regulations allowing its voluntary COVID-19 tracing appwith which it hopes to alert people potentially infected with the virus, so they can be quarantined and prevent its spreadingto go live. 
Under the system, an infected person enters a code onto their mobile phone, and if they come within 1.5 metres of someone else with the app, a message is sent telling the exposed person they may have caught the virus, so they can be tested. 
The app’s installation is voluntary and potentially exposed persons will only be notified with the express consent of the infected individual, the regulation says. 
Proximity data will be destroyed after 14 days.

A number of sanitary measures including testing all workers every 21 days were agreed with labor prosecutors in Minas Gerais state and with a local court, the authorities said, adding that Vale now had 15 days to draw up the details of a virus mitigation plan. 
Prosecutors will use reports the company has agreed to produce regularly to decide on possible new actions at the complex, where changes in production levels can potentially affect iron ore prices internationally. 
The Itabira complex produced almost 36 million tonnes of iron ore in 2019, according to Vale, out of the company’s total production of roughly 302 million tonnes. 
Vale reopened the mines after a coronavirus-induced lockdown on June 17, without changes in its annual production guidance. But scrutiny over the mines remains, as the death toll in Minas Gerais grows. Brazil has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases globally after the United States. 
Lawmakers were reported to be seeking to reverse the government’s declaration that mining is an “essential industry,” UBS analysts said in a note, citing a report by BNamericas. 
“We think the risk of a Minas Gerais lockdown and, in turn, the risk to Vale’s production guidance remains high,” Andreas Bokkenheuser said in a June 24 note to clients. (Reporting by Sabrina Valle; Editing by Tom Brown)"

South Korea, widely praised around the world for its handling of the pandemic without a full lockdown, has reported 12,602 coronavirus cases as of Thursday midnight, with 282 deaths. 
Remdesivir is designed to hinder certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, from making copies of themselves and potentially overwhelming the body’s immune system. The drug previously failed trials as an Ebola treatment. 
South Korea’s updated guidelines come after a study showed that the cheap and widely used dexamethasone reduced deaths in very sick COVID-19 patients. They advised doctors to take caution until a full study is published. 
“It seems appropriate to administer (dexamethasone), limited to severe cases with acute respiratory syndrome, as the doctor monitors the patient’s condition,” Kim Young-ok, director general of pharmaceutical safety bureau at the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, told a briefing on Friday. 
There was enough domestic supply of the dexamethasone, widely used since the 1960s, with the production of approximately 43 million tablets and 60 million injection ampoules a year, said Kim. 
Doctors in Europe will soon be able to treat patients with the drug after the healthcare regulator’s endorsement put it on track to become the first therapy for the disease on the continent. 
“An excessive use of dexamethasone can trigger different side effects as it tamps down the immune system along with inflammation, possibly leading to even cataract or glaucoma,” said Dr. Song Dae-sub, professor of pharmacy at Korea University. 
Korean health authorities also advised the dropping of hydroxychloroquine after a study found the decades-old malaria drug, which U.S. President Donald Trump touted a possible treatment, did not provide any benefit. 
There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 488,467 people globally, but about a dozen vaccines from more than 100 candidates globally are being tested on humans.

“Any player who tested positive will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols for discontinuing isolation and has been cleared by a physician,” the National Basketball Association said in a statement.

Players would be living, practicing and playing at the Disney resort to minimize the risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus.

The Saudi-backed government based in the south and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement headquartered in the north have so far publicly announced a total of 67 cases with 11 deaths. Only two of those infections and one of the deaths was reported by the Houthi authorities, both in the capital Sanaa. 
The sources said there was apparent undercounting in both the north and south of the country. 
The four sources, who have access to information from hospitals but who declined to be named, said Houthi health authorities had not shared additional test results with the World Health Organization (WHO) for at least 50 further patients with COVID-19 symptoms they were aware of at Kuwait hospital in Sanaa. Two of the sources said 20 other patients they had seen with similar symptoms died in that hospital. 
The two other sources said they were aware of at least 30 suspected coronavirus cases admitted to another Sanaa facility, Sheikh Zayed hospital, and said test results for those cases had also not been shared. 
Reuters did not see medical records from the hospitals and could not independently confirm the numbers provided by the sources. The hospitals could not immediately be reached for comment. 
“Houthi authorities do not share the results of the tests with doctors and with the WHO when the results are positive,” one of the sources told Reuters. 
A spokesman for the Houthi movement, Mohammad Abdulsalam, referred Reuters to the Houthi health ministry. The health ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. On May 3, a Houthi official told a press conference in Sanaa that authorities had detected suspected cases and tested them but did not provide a figure or mention the results. 
Asked by Reuters whether it was concerned about a coronavirus outbreak going unreported in Houthi-held areas, the WHO said its role was to “actively advise, influence and inform” discussions on case declaration and reporting, which it said it had been doing for weeks. 
It said it saw Yemen as “one country, one people” and cautioned against speculation related to “the number of probable cases not being reported”. 
“Given the testing capacity in country, which is very limited, tests are being done on persons who meet the criteria or case definition and exposure history. We would not, and frankly no country would, be able to test everyone who was sick or experiencing symptoms,” it said in a statement. 
It said it was “operating under the assumption that full blown transmission is now occurring” across Yemen and that it was ramping up “community engagement and awareness activities.” 
DEATHS IN ADEN 
The internationally-recognised government based in the southern port of Aden has accused the Houthis of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, a charge the group denies. In a tweet on May 7, Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani said there appeared to be a “serious epidemiological coronavirus situation” in Houthi-controlled areas and urged the authorities not to “conceal facts”. 
However, the two sources said authorities in areas under the Saudi-backed government’s control have also not fully disclosed the extent of the pandemic. At least 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients have died at Al Amal hospital in Aden, they said. The hospital could not immediately be reached for comment. 
“In Aden, we also have dozens of people dying at home but nobody tested them to know why they died. Some hospitals refused to take in patients showing coronavirus symptoms because they are not equipped to handle those cases. We cannot really blame them,” one of the sources said, without naming the hospitals. 
An Aden-based government official, who declined to be named, said the authorities were declaring COVID-19 cases but admitted inadequate testing, a rise in other diseases due to recent flooding and administrative issues after a leading separatist group declared emergency rule were challenges. 
The national coronavirus committee, set up by the internationally recognised government, has publicly announced 4 deaths among 39 confirmed cases in Aden, out of the total of 65 confirmed cases and 10 deaths in southern areas. 
CRITICAL CASES 
On May 2, the public prosecutor’s office in Aden issued a statement, seen by Reuters, saying it was investigating media reports about the refusal by some private and public hospitals and health centres, which it did not identify, as well as doctors “to admit some emergency medical cases or provide medical attention to critical cases”. 
The WHO said in its statement on Sunday that it had been advising local authorities throughout Yemen to report cases in order to secure resources and equipment already in short supply globally, but that the decision to do so rests with a country’s leaders under international health regulations.    
“WHO encourages all countries to be fully transparent in this regard - only when we have all the data and numbers are we be able to, with the closest degree of accuracy, respond accordingly, and prioritize gaps and needs,” it said. 
As of May 9, Yemen had reported 803 COVID-19 test results, according to WHO data. At that time, the WHO said Yemen had 38 COVID-19 isolation units - 18 of them operational, four labs with testing capacity, 520 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 154 ICU ventilators. 
The WHO said in a report on Monday that a surge in cases could overwhelm Yemen’s healthcare facilities. 
Yemen has long been plagued by wars and humanitarian disasters. The latest in a sequence of conflicts escalated in March 2015 when a Saudi-led alliance intervened against the Houthis after they ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. 
The Western-backed coalition failed to crush the rebellion by the Houthi movement and its allies, and the war has been in stalemate for years with the Houthis holding most large urban centres. 
The conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 since 2015, has already caused what the U.N. says is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with some 24 million Yemenis, or 80% of the population, reliant on aid and some 10 million facing hunger. 
Health and sanitation systems are wrecked and diseases such as cholera are rife. Many diseases such as dengue fever share similar symptoms to COVID-19, complicating efforts to estimate the extent of the pandemic, the Saudi-backed government’s health minister said on April 29.

“I’m not a nervous Nellie, I’m just looking at the numbers,” said Cuomo, noting that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. “Many wear masks. But there is no social distancing. Police are in their face ... If you were at a protest, get a test, please.” 
Officials in Chicago this week expressed similar concern, and asked protesters to quarantine themselves for 14 days. 
Cuomo took time in his daily coronavirus briefing to sympathize with the protests, calling Floyd’s May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody a murder and adding, “I share the outrage.” 
“It is a metaphor for the systemic racism and injustice that we have seen,” he added. 
Following protests not only in New York City, but in the upstate cities of Buffalo, Albany, Rochester and Syracuse, Cuomo said the state would observe a “symbolic moment” of silence at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) for sharing grief and understanding. 
“This is an injustice that should never happen again,” he said. 
Cuomo said his concern about increased spread of the virus during the demonstrations would not impede the state’s regionally phased reopening, which is set to allow New York City to open on Monday for limited economic activity. A second phase of activity, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said could start as early as July, will include outdoor restaurant seating. 
With more people wearing face coverings, the state has made significant progress in halting the spread, as reflected in a drop in the rate of people testing positive for the virus over the past six weeks to 2% from 26%, he said. 
The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients also continued trending lower, he added.

As of Thursday, Brazil had nearly 615,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, second only to the United States. With 34,021 COVID-19 fatalities, its death toll overtook Italy’s. 
Across the political spectrum this week, lawmakers in Brasilia have decried the far-right leader’s defiance of public health experts on the outbreak and his campaign to end state quarantine measures, which he has criticized for hurting the economy. 
They have also raised concerns about his threats to institutions. Bolsonaro has vocally backed his militant supporters who have called in the streets for the military to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court, which has been investigating him and his followers. 
More than 30 motions have been presented in Congress to impeach Bolsonaro for trampling on Brazil’s constitution, mostly from leftist opponents. 
But Bolsonaro’s position is safe for now, four politicians told Reuters this week. 
They said he has courted enough lawmakers in Congress with key appointments to fend off the threats of impeachment. Many now fear such a move would be a badly timed distraction from the growing health crisis. 
“Bolsonaro has artificially stirred confrontation between Brazil’s democratic institutions, but my party is not seeking his impeachment because we cannot contribute to more instability in this unprecedented crisis,” said Bruno Araujo, president of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. 
Araujo said Bolsonaro will be judged by Brazilian voters at the next presidential election, set for 2022. 
“Until then we will lurch from crisis to crisis, from outburst to outburst by this authoritarian president,” he said in an interview. 
The Speaker of the House, who would decide to put an impeachment to the vote, has also said Brazil needs first to unite in fighting the coronavirus outbreak and he did not want to put “more wood on the fire.” 
Bolsonaro has said his aims are democratic and those seeking to undermine his government are the greatest threat to Brazil’s constitution. Last week, he said the Supreme Court was threatening to “plunge Brazil into a political crisis” with its investigations. 
One inquiry is looking into the financing of his supporters’ alleged disinformation campaigns on social media. Another is investigating if Bolsonaro interfered illegally in police appointments for personal reasons. Bolsonaro says his supporters and family are being unfairly targeted and that the accusations are untrue. 
LOSING MODERATES 
Felipe Rigoni and Nelson Trad, centrists on the left and right of the aisle in Congress, said Bolsonaro had deliberately fueled tensions by joining his supporters’ anti-democratic rallies, turning off moderate voters who backed him in 2018. 
Still, the atmosphere of conflict plays well with his core supporters, both lawmakers said. Although rejection of his government has climbed, as many as a third of voters remain loyal, opinion polls suggest. 
The constant confrontation has distracted attention from the severe public health and economic crises assailing the country, Rigoni said. 
Investment banks are forecasting that the economy will contract up to 7.7% this year. Investors rattled by the depth of the recession and the government handling of the pandemic have pulled over $31 billion out of the country this year, according to Central Bank data. The Treasury said foreigners reduced their holdings of Brazilian bonds in April to the lowest since 2009. 
If the recession and investigations into Bolsonaro get bad enough to erode his support, the tide in Congress could eventually turn toward impeachment, said center-left lawmaker Tabata Amaral. 
“For now, he needs continuous ideological warfare to stay in power, by creating new crises and new enemies every day so that people don’t see what’s happening right in front of our faces,” she said.

Mourning relatives looked on, as a body bag was loaded into an ambulance and taken away to a cemetery. 
It was yet another casualty from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 4,500 people and infected more than 150,000 across India. While infection rates from the virus have begun to fall in many countries, in India they are still rising sharply, and epidemiologists warn peak is yet to come. 
Concerns are rising about how the country of 1.3 billion, with one of the world’s most overburdened healthcare systems, will handle the surge with roughly 6,000 new infections being detected daily this week. 
On Thursday, Reuters was given exclusive access inside Max Super Speciality Hospital - currently the largest such private COVID-19 treatment site in New Delhi - where some 200 patients are being treated for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
While India is easing a more than two-month long nationwide lockdown that was aimed at reining in the spread of the disease, the battle against the virus rages within its strained hospital system. 
“We are getting more and more people daily both in numbers and in the severity of disease,” said Arun Dewan, the director of the hospital’s critical care section. “We’re not seeing any end.” 
Around him, the eerie calm within the hospital was broken only by the sound of machines beeping and patients coughing - most of whom were separated only by white curtains. Staff in heavy protective gear move around softly, speaking in murmurs. 
Until a few months ago the cries of babies would often fill this section of the hospital, which was meant for neonatal care. But with the number of cases surging, Max designated the entire building for COVID-19 patients. 
Now, posters of Winnie the Pooh and other cartoon characters meant to soothe children, beam down upon patients struggling to beat a deadly virus. 
It is the first time in his 35-year-career that Dewan is battling a pandemic of this scale, he said, and while each day has been as struggle, he fears the worst is yet to come. 
“Manpower will be the biggest challenge. We have reached the limit,” he said, adding even as the toll rises, the wait list of patients is growing fast. 
But there are small victories that keep the staff going. For Steena, a doctor working in the ICU who only gave her first name, one such moment was when a 70-year-old woman brought in dire condition recovered in recent weeks. 
“After seven or eight days, she was taken off a ventilator, and tested negative,” she said, sounding hopeful, before quickly turning to attend to yet another patient.

(Reuters) - As the novel coronavirus tore through Italy and then New York in March, California, anticipating a deadly surge in cases, ordered hospitals to shut down routine procedures and called in thousands of health care workers to help patients. 
But the predicted surge never came. 
And the cost of all that preparation - setting up field hospitals, doubling the number of intensive care rooms, purchasing protective equipment - dealt a blow to hospital bottom lines, while the ban on all non-emergency procedures cut revenues in half. 
The measures drove hospitals in the most populous U.S. state close to bankruptcy, costing them as much as $14 billion and forcing them to lay off of thousands of health care workers, according to the California Hospital Association. 
Now, reeling from the twin financial blows, hospitals are struggling to get ready for a possible new surge in cases this autumn, and wrestling with the question of whether they over-prepared last time around. 
CALL FOR REINFORCEMENTS AMID LAYOFFS 
Expecting to need thousands of doctors, nurses and other workers to fight the pandemic, California in March called for a “Health Corps” to care for patients, with 95,000 people signing up. 
Of the tens of thousands who responded to the call to join the Health Corps, fewer than 800 have been hired by the state, according to state program data reviewed by Reuters. 
“The worst thing we could do was really to under-prepare,” said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, Medical Director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a public hospital system serving California’s Silicon Valley. “From a patient health standpoint and from a public health standpoint, we had to prepare.” 
The industry is now asking the state for $1 billion in aid to help hospitals defray some of those costs and meet their financial obligations for the next few months, and another $3 billion in the new fiscal year beginning July 1. 
“Most hospitals’ balance sheets have been trashed,” said Carmela Coyle, president of the California Hospital Association. “It’s a one-two punch that many hospitals will find it difficult to survive.” 
Hardest hit were hospitals that treat large numbers of patients insured under the Medicaid program covering the poor and disabled, and the retiree Medicare program, she said. 
The result was a terrible irony - at a time when health professionals treating patients infected with the virus were overworked and in some cases becoming ill themselves, thousands more lost their livelihoods in layoffs and furloughs. 
“It’s just a shock to be let go in the middle of all this,” said nurse Tammy Wright, who was laid off from Palomar Health in San Diego County. 
Palomar Health’s CEO Diane Hansen said the hospital expects losses of about $12 million by June, down from an anticipated $20 million operating surplus. She said the gap would have been larger if the hospital hadn’t laid off employees. 
Wright, meanwhile, has tried to find work and had two interviews, but few jobs are available near her home in Vista. 
She applied to the Health Corps, but she said nothing was available nearby. 
DIFFICULTY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC 
Even before the pandemic, 38% of all California hospitals - public and private - were losing money after years of thin operating margins and industry consolidation. Another 11% had margins hovering near zero, the hospital association said. 
Budget squeezes had already left hospitals with few extra beds and little additional equipment or gear on hand, said Kerry Heinrich, CEO of nonprofit Loma Linda University Medical Center in San Bernardino County. 
Loma Linda’s six-campus hospital system, with an annual budget of about $2 billion, lost $160 million in revenue during March and April alone, Heinrich said, an amount dwarfing its typical annual operating margin of $40-$80 million. The system trimmed hours and laid off about 1,000 employees. 
Loma Linda will receive about $39 million in relief from the federal CARES Act, the $2.3 trillion in federal fiscal stimulus to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus, and will also apply to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for reimbursement of supplies and other costs, but it will still have a budget gap of about $120 million, he said.

Statewide, California hospitals have received $3.4 billion from the CARES Act, about 4% of the national total for hospitals, the Hospital Association says. 
Preparing for COVID-19’s first wave left hospitals vulnerable even as they get ready to face another, hospital administrators said. 
“Who do you look to when the second wave happens?” asked Loma Linda’s Heinrich. “You look to hospitals and we have all been deeply weakened.”

Attracted by relatively good wages at Seaboard Foods, immigrants like Felix and Pilar Jimenez arrived by the hundreds to slaughter hogs and process meat for shipment all over the world. The Mexican couple started work in Guymon, on the vast plains of Oklahoma’s panhandle, about a year after the plant opened, followed in time by their sons Michael, now 26, and Anthony, 22. 
In recent months, as in so many U.S. cities with meat- packing operations, COVID-19 ripped through the plant and surrounding community, bringing economic uncertainty, fear and - in the case of the Jimenez family - tragedy. 
Seaboard reports that, as of May 21, 641 of its some 2,700 employees tested positive for the virus - roughly a quarter of its workforce. Pilar, Michael and Anthony Jimenez all got sick. So did Felix, 56, who had been mostly homebound as he recovered from heart bypass surgery. He died May 9. 
Guymon is part of the coronavirus’ new frontier - mostly rural communities with large meatpacking plants where employees often work inches apart, carpool to their jobs and live in crowded or multi-generational homes. 
Interviewed at the family’s apartment days after his father’s death, Michael Jimenez said Guymon residents need to wake up to the dangers of the coronavirus, something that extends beyond the plant and especially threatens older and medically fragile people like Felix. 
“I just hope the whole community realizes how fatal this can be,” said Michael Jimenez, speaking through a protective mask. 
It’s difficult to pin down how each of the Jimenez family members got the disease. Pilar and her sons say any of them could have caught it at the packing plant, then infected Felix. 
“I think we brought the virus home to him,” said Pilar Jimenez, 53, who lived with both Anthony and Felix. 
Michael Jimenez said Felix never left the apartment except to walk the dog, and then only with a mask, adding that he and Anthony worked alongside a co-worker who they later learned was ill. 
On the other hand, the virus is circulating in the wider community, not just at the plant. Texas County, where the plant is located, had recorded 820 cases as of Friday morning, including four deaths. 
Despite the high rate of infection among plant workers, the company has reported no deaths among employees. 
Duke Sand, chief executive officer of Seaboard Foods, told Reuters the company is adhering to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on how to contain the virus at the plant, including timetables on when affected employees should return to work and what safety equipment, such as screens and masks, to give them. 
Sand said the company, a subsidiary of Seaboard Corp, has been fortunate in that it saw its first case in mid-April, well after other meatpacking facilities around the country. Other plants have been less transparent with their numbers - for instance, Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL], the world’s largest hog processor, declined in a May 8 statement to Reuters to confirm case totals at its numerous facilities, citing the need to respect employees’ privacy. 
Asked about Felix Jimenez’ death, Seaboard’s Sand said: “The purpose of this testing is that we don’t have any tragedies such as that.” 
DIVIDED SENTIMENTS 
As in many meat-packing towns around the country, local leaders and residents are torn about how to address the new threat, which pits the economic needs of employees and local businesses against rapidly growing health risks to everyone in the community. 
The Seaboard plant, where wages start at $16 per hour, is by far the largest employer in the city of fewer than 11,300 people. The plant is both a linchpin of the local economy and a hot spot in the nation’s battle against the new coronavirus. 
Opinions about the dangers of the virus do not necessarily fall along neat or predictable lines, interviews with about two dozen local residents show. Although the population is small, Guymon and Texas County are demographically and politically complex. 
The county, where about 70% of plant workers live, is a Republican stronghold in the heart of the U.S. Bible Belt, and it overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump in 2016. Yet residents have diverse backgrounds: Plant workers come from North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Some 41% of households in the county speak languages other than English at home, according to the most recent U.S. Census figures. 
The city of Guymon, which was majority white at the turn of the century, is now more than half Hispanic or Latino. The plant dominates the economy but many agricultural businesses operate around it, mostly owned by whites. 
As different as residents are, their lives intersect. The city’s many businesses rely on the immigrants as customers and workers, and some local businesses are owned by minorities and immigrants. Nearly everyone seems to either work at the plant or know someone who does. 
Support for the company seems to run hot and cold depending on feedback from a friend or a brother-in-law. Several workers expressed fear of going to work but fear, in equal measure, of losing their jobs if they complained. 
The main point of contention appears to be how seriously to take the threat of the coronavirus. 
For now, Seaboard confirmed, its employees appear to account for roughly half of Texas County’s COVID-19 cases. The numbers are in flux: Not every employee has been tested and the county’s confirmed caseload is steadily rising with expanded testing. 
What’s certain is that the virus respects no boundaries, said Dr. Martin Bautista, who already is working with other physicians to contain infections at Guymon’s nursing home, where he said one patient has died. 
“It’s a virus. It doesn’t recognize the color of your skin, socio-economic status, nothing.” 
Still, some people in Guymon are dismissive of the COVID-19 risk, calling mask wearers “sheep” or suggesting God will protect those who have faith. 
“Being country people, it seems like our immunity is a lot higher, and we have Jesus,” says Kalye Griffin, 42, owner of the Top Hand Western Store. 
Local leaders say language barriers can hamper basic health messages about what precautions to take. 
“There are multiple languages in Guymon, said City Manager Joe Dunham. “People just don’t understand the gravity of the situation that we’re in.”” 
Other residents are eager to get the economy back on track. 
Oklahoma was one of a handful of states that did not issue statewide stay-at-home orders as the coronavirus picked up steam. Texas County closed nonessential businesses relatively late, compared to the rest of the country, on March 28. And it was among the first to reopen, on April 24. 
“I don’t think we should have closed,” said Suzanne Bryan, as she waved at passing motorists outside her food and gift shop on Guymon’s red cobbled Main Street. “It’s like the flu, there is a 98-99% survival rate.” 
Although the precise mortality rate for the coronavirus is not known, medical experts say they believe it exceeds 1%, more than 10 times the rate for the flu. 
In any event, Bryan, a member of the evangelical Christian Guymon Church of the Nazarene, said God is in control of what happens. “It’s not about me,” she said. “It’s God’s plan.” 
Several Hispanic or Latino business owners with family or friends at the plant told Reuters Seaboard should be doing more to protect employees. They said they knew of people pressured to return to work too soon after being ill. 
“They care about production, not workers,” said Cuban immigrant José Francisco Linares, who runs the Papachongo’s Restaurant and Market close to the Jimenez home. 
Reuters was not able to independently confirm allegations of pressure to return to work. Seaboard CEO Sand said the company is advising workers to follow CDC guidance: Allowing at least 10 days to elapse since symptoms such as fever first appeared, and at least three days since they resolved. 
Business owner Ivan Lorenzo said he is baffled as to why the plant has not shut in a county that has no health facilities capable of treating coronavirus. As in many rural areas in the United States, the local hospital is tiny, with limited equipment, beds and medical personnel. 
“This is what happens when a big company like that comes to a little town like this,” said Lorenzo, 42, speaking from his shop, Ivan Barber Studio, on Main Street, where he said employees wear masks and gloves and work six feet apart. “They do whatever they want.” 
Asked whether he was prepared to close the plant depending on test results, Sand said: “I wouldn’t rule out anything that would be in the best interests of the employees.” 
THOUSANDS INFECTED, DOZENS DEAD 
The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the $185 billion U.S. meat and poultry processing industry, which employs 68,000 people as slaughterers and meat trimmers, according to 2019 data from the U.S. Labor Department. 
Such plants have proved devastatingly effective vectors of disease. 
In the meatpacking industry generally, thousands of employees have been infected with the coronavirus and dozens have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). Seaboard jointly operates another pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, where 59 cases have been reported among workers. 
Although Seaboard never shut its plants, about 30 facilities operated by other companies temporarily closed in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and several other Midwestern states, according to the UFCW. Pork and beef slaughter capacity dropped by 30% to 40%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
To avoid further decline in a major food supply, U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of April ordered meat plants stay open during the pandemic. 
At least 14 plants have re-opened, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with some installing barriers between work stations and taking other safety measures. 
Trump says that has reduced the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. 
“They had a disproportionately high number of people that had the problem, and that’s going away,” the president said at a White House news conference on Tuesday. “The plants are very, very clean now.” 
SICKNESS AND FEAR 
Infections in Texas County surfaced slowly, in rural communities surrounding Guymon, with the first one emerging March 28, according to Texas County data. 
Around mid-April, a Seaboard employee tested positive, according to the company. After that, the plant offered to pay for voluntary testing at local clinics for employees who reported symptoms, or had close contact with infected people. The case count spiraled upward. 
By mid-May, when the company offered mass testing, sickness and fear had pushed absentee rates as high as 30%, and daily slaughter fell from the normal 22,000 hogs per day to as low as 10,000 some days, according to plant General Manager Rick Sappington. 
Martin Rosas, the local UFCW president, said he appreciated the company’s response to the crisis. 
Seaboard agreed to a union proposal for paid sick leave to motivate workers to report symptoms and self-quarantine at home, Rosas said. It also agreed to test the temperatures of all workers entering the plant and to pay them an extra $2 an hour to compensate for the hazards of working during the outbreak, he said. 
“We have had a very positive response from Seaboard,” Rosas said. 
Like other plants, Seaboard has instituted attendance bonuses - separate from hazard pay - which amount to an extra $100 a week. Some critics, speaking about businesses generally, have said giving bonuses for showing up can incentivize employees to work when ill. 
Seaboard CEO Sand said that is not the company’s purpose. 
“We are being very upfront about making sure employees know that if you’re feeling any symptoms, not feeling right, report that to us, see your doctors, stay home,” he said. 
‘NO PULLBACK’ 
Guymon Mayor Sean Livengood, 30, said the reopening of the city will continue apace. “At this point there’s no pullback,” he told Reuters. 
A production manager at the Seaboard plant, he is optimistic about the town’s re-emergence from the shutdown, and stresses that residents should use their best judgment on whether it is safe for them, personally, to venture out. 
“The big thing for us is if you don’t feel comfortable going out, please don’t go out,” he said. 
Harold Tyson, the county emergency manager, is less sanguine about reopening, urging painstaking caution. 
“I would like for us to slow down,” Tyson said, “and we’re not.” 
Nancy Schmid, CEO of the county’s only hospital, Memorial Hospital of Texas County, is worried, too. Recently released from quarantine because of exposure to COVID-positive employees, she has tested negative for the virus and is busy running a 25-bed facility that’s ill-equipped for a pandemic. 
She said the facility lacks air purification machines to prevent the spread of the virus inside. The hospital is being overwhelmed with potential COVID-19 patients seeking diagnostic services such as X-rays and CT-scans, she said, but it does not have enough doctors and other medical staff to treat the people as inpatients. As a result, county residents need to be sent as far away as Oklahoma City, a four-hour car ride, for care. 
“We need doctors more than New York City,” she said. 
‘ALWAYS THERE’ 
Though his family initially took Felix Jimenez to a local clinic, he rapidly deteriorated to the point that he couldn’t be treated in Guymon. 
Within days of falling ill in early May, he was rushed to a hospital in Liberal, Kansas, 40 miles away, and later placed on a ventilator. Then, doctors opted to fly him by helicopter to Amarillo, Texas, for dialysis. 
He grew gravely ill mid-flight and the pilot turned around. Felix died where the helicopter landed, in the parking lot of the Kansas hospital. 
Michael Jimenez is troubled, not just by his father’s ordeal, but by the prospect that an experience just as horrible might await other vulnerable members of the Guymon community. 
Residents don’t always appreciate plant workers like his parents, he said. “They don’t understand some of these people left everything they had to provide for their families.” 
After immigrating with Pilar from Mexico 30 years ago, Felix Jimenez spent his life bouncing among meatpacking jobs in Iowa, Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma. He was known in Guymon not just for the friendships he built at work, but for his involvement with the city’s Catholic Church and youth sports group. 
After his retirement for health reasons seven years ago, Felix began buying, fixing and selling cars, his son said. He earned a reputation for being able to start any motor. 
Kids who missed the school bus knew they could knock on his door to get a lift, Michael Jimenez said. Felix’s sons leaned on him too. “The one who was always there was my dad,” Michael Jimenez said. 
Growing up, the Jimenez brothers thought of finding jobs in the oil and gas industry, but Felix steered them toward the plant, citing its stable hours and steady pay. The four of them worked all over the facility, from the “kill floor” to pork-belly freezing to shipping. 
Now that his father is gone and others in the family have mostly recovered from COVID-19, Michael is worried about their return to work. 
Pilar has diabetes and a heart stent, and Michael fears she could be reinfected. Experts say reinfections appear unlikely in the short term but they don’t know how long immunity in recovered patients may last. 
“She’s vulnerable,” Michael Jimenez said of his mother. “We have to protect her.” 
He added that the family also must pay the rent.

But Dave Ramsden told Reuters the issues around taking rates below zero were complex and would take time to think through, and there was plenty of room for the BoE to carry on its massive programme of government bond purchases. 
The BoE said on May 7 that Britain’s economy might suffer its sharpest slump in over 300 years in 2020 after the government imposed a shutdown to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
While stressing the huge uncertainties about the outlook, the central bank said the economy could get back to its pre-pandemic size by the second half of 2021. 
Ramsden said the BoE’s scenario saw investment cuts by businesses causing long-term economic damage. 
“But there will be other mechanisms for scarring,” he said. 
Some companies might have to permanently downsize or fold altogether because “they just didn’t fit sufficiently with what the current post-COVID world looks like”. 
Persistently high unemployment was also a danger even if Britain’s labour market had typically been more robust than expected after other recent economic shocks. 
“We were very clear in May that we saw the risks on balance to the downside,” Ramsden said. 
At the same time, a 25% economic contraction between April and June included in the BoE’s scenario might prove too steep. 
“If you took a literal read on some of the fast indicators for the UK, and also looking at other countries and how they are responding to the end of their lockdowns, you might think, well, maybe the fall in Q2 isn’t going to be quite as precipitous as we had it in May,” he said. 
“But could it persist for a bit longer? That’s an open question and these are very, very early days.” 
JUNE STIMULUS? 
The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee is due to meet again next month. 
Most economists expect it will expand further its war chest for buying bonds, most of them issued by Britain’s government, which is borrowing heavily to prop up the economy. 
“I am certainly not going to rule it out,” Ramsden said when asked about the possibility of an increase to the bond-buying programme, which the BoE bolstered by a record 200 billion pounds as recently as March to 645 billion pounds. 
“It’s quite possible that we could do more at that meeting or at subsequent meetings. But we will make that decision at the time,” he said. 
As the BoE’s deputy governor for markets and banking, Ramsden is responsible for its asset purchase programme and an array of liquidity operations to keep the financial system pumping. 
Several of the multi-billion pound programmes were launched as the coronavirus crisis escalated and are now run by BoE staff who are largely working from home. 
Financial markets have calmed down from the panicked selling of British gilts and other normally safe assets in March. 
“That improved position in markets is not to be taken for granted. I think the situation’s still fragile,” Ramsden said. 
The BoE’s stock of bonds has jumped from the equivalent of 25% of Britain’s annual economic output to 33% in just a few weeks, an unprecedented surge in its balance sheet. 
Ramsden said the BoE still had “quite a lot of headroom” to buy more gilts, but the pace of purchases could be adjusted. 
“We have the potential to flex any purchase programme. We haven’t done that in May. We are continuing with the current programme. But we keep a close eye on this kind of thing. The current pace of the programme, I should stress.” 
ACTIVE ON NEGATIVE RATES 
As for other, more radical policies, Ramsden echoed comments of Governor Andrew Bailey this week who said he was ruling nothing out and nothing in. 
“We are keeping our whole tool-set under active review,” Ramsden said. 
It was “perfectly reasonable to have an open mind on negative rates,” he said, but the BoE had to understand how they might affect Britain’s banking system and how they had worked in other economies in periods different to the current situation. 
“These are really serious issues where you can’t just say, ‘Oh, this happened in this episode in another country, so let’s therefore apply it to the UK.’ You need to work through the consequences,” Ramsden said.

On expanding the BoE’s corporate bond purchases to include riskier debt - an option floated by BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane - Ramsden said the potential for boosting growth and smoothing out markets would need to be looked at, and Britain’s finance ministry would have to commit to meeting any losses. 
But Ramsden ruled out another possibility mentioned in financial markets recently - broadening the BoE’s government bond purchases to include inflation-linked bonds and debt shorter than three years in duration. 
“The fundamentals of (the existing bond-buying programme) work. That’s why index-linked, going shorter than three years, for me, that’s not on the agenda.”

Cooks at his Manhattan eatery, which was named World’s Best Restaurant in 2017 by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, are preparing 3,000 meals a day for frontline workers and underprivileged New Yorkers, most of them distributed at a Harlem church. 
“I had a person the other day who said, ‘Oh my God, this is the best meal I’ve ever had,’” said Humm, standing inside his darkened, empty restaurant, which was shuttered in mid-March by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Working alongside New York City-based nonprofit Rethink Food, which transforms restaurant leftovers into dishes for the disadvantaged, Humm and his staff have churned out some of the 90,000 meals being served each week to the needy during the pandemic. 
“When this crisis started happening and we had to turn off the lights for a minute, we were a little bit in shock like everyone was,” Humm said. “But then pretty quickly, we felt like we wanted to help in any way we can.”Stripped of its tablecloths and upscale clientele, the dining room looks lonely compared with the activity in the kitchen where meals are prepared for distribution at churches, soup kitchens, community centers and housing projects.Humm transformed the kitchen into a commissary using private donations, and $250,000 donated by American Express, all of which went through Rethink Food.After COVID-19 lockdown restrictions lift and some normalcy is restored, Humm knows he will continue cooking not just for the 1% but for those facing extreme poverty as well.”Food is magical, it’s so powerful,” he said. “I mean, there are very few things in the world that touch everyone.”

As the nation clamped down with stay-at-home orders, Kelly said his company, Emerald Packaging Inc. in Union City, Calif, saw demand for the factory’s output explode. Emerald churns out plastic bags for produce, like baby carrots and iceberg lettuce, and Kelly attributed the growth, in part, to the perception that packaged produce is a safer alternative to unwrapped items. 
Emerald represents the other side of the current novel coronavirus crisis, which has seen unemployment surge to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The jobless rate hit 14.7% in April. While many companies face a slump, some are rushing to add workers, including delivery services like Instacart. A recent survey by the Atlanta Fed concluded there have been three jobs added to the U.S. economy for every 10 layoffs. 
Eric Schnur, CEO of specialty chemical maker Lubrizol Corp., owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Corp, said he anticipates “many millions in extra costs associated with responding to COVID-19.” Lubrizol’s business boom includes a three-fold increase in its output of the gelling agent used to make hand sanitizer. 
Schnur said the extra costs go beyond stepped up cleaning and safety equipment and includes “significant increases in supply chain and logistics costs as we work to get our materials to those who have the greatest need.” 
Another company facing added costs is Calumet Electronics Corp., in Calumet, Mich., which said it has spent $80,000 on everything from soap to mobile desks to keep workers safe through the crisis. For more on Calumet, click here: 
For Emerald, orders surged 150% in March and were up another 7% in April. But there’s a dark side to that surge, both in terms of cost and complexity. 
All the steps the company has taken both to boost output and keep workers safe are expected to add at least $350,000 to costs by the end of the year. This doesn’t include the lost production time, which adds up to at least an hour each day, that machines have to be shut down for cleaning. Kelly, Emerald’s chief executive officer, said he hasn’t figured out what this will do to his profits, but he expects a big hit to his margins. Emerald is a family-owned business with annual sales of about $85 million. 
One of the biggest costs for Emerald was $50,000 Kelly spent on an automated temperature scanner. When the crisis first hit, Emerald implemented a regimen that included workers getting their temperature taken at the start and end of each shift. 
But Kelly soon realized there was a problem having 40 people at the start of each shift waiting to be checked, one by one, by someone standing close to each employee as they were screened. 
“It also just isn’t comfortable,” he said. “You know it’s a temperature gun, but you basically are holding a gun up to someone else’s head. It just made everyone uncomfortable.” 
The new system will be a scanner that flashes a red warning signal if someone walks by with a body temperature over 100.4 degrees. 
COVID-RELATED COSTS 
Another big-ticket item is the cleaning, which accounts for $75,000 of the added costs. This includes assigning six workers two on each shift to constantly scrub and sanitize surfaces and $10,000 for six backpacks that these workers now use to hose floors with cleanser. The company, which was founded in 1963 by Kelly’s father, has added 10 workers to its staff of 240 and is heaping on overtime as well to get the orders out the door. 
Even the company’s rag bill exploded. They used to buy 2,000 rags a week. Now it’s 7,000. The cost of that one item has jumped from $300 a month to $1,000, while disposable glove use has tripled. 
Michael Rincon, Emerald’s director of operations, says each week brings new twists. For instance, they’ve discovered that having workers constantly wiping surfaces with isopropyl alcohol erodes signs and buttons but they only realized that after it was too late. On one machine in the factory, the word “danger” printed in bright red has blurred. 
Rincon said the faded labels will be repainted. But he’s also had to replace buttons on machines that have had the lettering rubbed away. The cost of a new button isn’t much, but the repairs mean costly shutdowns on lines that run around the clock. Some buttons can be replaced in a few minutes, but others take longer, said Rincon. 
Kelly said he even thought about trying to put through a price increase to offset some of these expenses. But a few weeks ago, his biggest customer let him know that was a non-starter. The customer told Kelly he was going to see who else might be able to supply him with produce bags, presumably at a better price. 
Besides the costs, there are also plenty of unpredictable management challenges. The company made masks mandatory eight weeks ago, at the very beginning of the crisis, but Kelly and other managers still find workers in the plant who aren’t wearing them or are wearing them incorrectly. 
One problem is the nature of their factory, which is dominated by large, noisy machines. The only way to communicate in many parts of the factory is to lean your head right next to your coworker. “I’m constantly walking through the factory throwing my arms apart to remind people,” said Kelly. 
Emerald has had three false alarms, with workers either calling in sick or falling sick at work and being sent home. However, none tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Kelly said that in a country that regulates so many things, there’s still no good government guidance beyond general guidelines. 
“The toughest thing is that there isn’t much direction from the state or the federal government,” Pallavi Joyappa, Emerald’s chief operating officer, said. “You are kind of making it up as you go along.”

Some are obvious: Masks, gloves, and lots of cleanser. But at Calumet Electronics Corp., the list includes four mobile, pedestal-style desks for the summer interns. Todd Brassard, the company’s chief operating officer, said they normally pack them into a tight conference room. But with the risk of infection, they’ll instead be spread out through the factory this yeara safe distance from each other and from the company’s production workers. 
Business at Calumet, based in Calumet, Mich., is up 25% as demand for the company’s printed circuit boards has grown from makers of critical machines that need them. Brassard estimates he’s spent $80,000 so far. Here’s what’s included in his list:

The trial, conducted with local partner University of the Witwatersrand, will consist of 2,000 volunteers from 18 to 65 years of age, including some HIV positive patients, who will be monitored for 12 months after vaccination to asses how well the vaccine guards against COVID-19. 
“Once 60% of the population, especially the adult population, becomes immune, we expect that effective reproductive rate to go under 1, which basically means the virus will still be around, it will still circulate, but its chain of transmission has been interrupted,” said Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at Wits University and leader of the trial. 
Hopes are that South Africa’s involvement in vaccine trials will ensure the continent will have access to an affordable vaccine and not be left at the back of the queue. 
South Africa is the second country outside of the United Kingdom to take part in the Oxford trial after Brazil launched its study on Wednesday. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, also known as AZD1222, was originally developed by Oxford University scientists, who are now working with AstraZeneca on development and production. 
There are over 4,000 participants enrolled in the UK, with enrollment of an additional 10,000 participants planned, the university said in a statement on Wednesday. 
A larger study of the same vaccine in up to 30,000 participants is planned in the United States. 
South Africa, which last month began a phased easing of its coronavirus lockdown, has the highest rate of infections on the continent, with confirmed cases at over 100,000 and deaths at more than 2,000. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned Africa could be the next epicentre of the pandemic. 
Trying out a new medical intervention in Africa always rings alarm bells because of a history of big pharmaceutical companies using Africans as guinea pigs. 
“I feel a little bit scared, but I want to know what is going on with this vaccine so that I can tell my friends and others,” said Junior Mhlongo, a volunteer who received the vaccine at a hospital in Johannesburg. 
There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness caused by the new coronavirus, but more than a dozen vaccines from more than 100 candidates globally are being tested in humans.

The liquid is plasma from a recently recovered patient, believed to be rich in virus antibodies and which immunologist Abdullah and his team in the southern city of Basra have been using to treat critical COVID-19 cases since April. 
He now hopes to get health ministry support to use plasma as a generalised treatment before patients’ conditions become life-threatening, but he says he is facing a shortage of donors. 
“Among all recovered patients, only three percent (of eligible donors) volunteer,” he said. “... If half of those recovered patients came, we would have enough (plasma) to treat patients in Basra until the end of the year.” 
While the effectiveness of plasma as a coronavirus treatment remains unclear, the health ministry is allowing it to be gathered at blood banks and used under certain conditions, while the global pharma industry is working to develop antibody-based therapies. 
Abdullah is convinced that plasma helps patients’ weakened immune systems fight the virus and, to compensate for the shortage of donors, is using a plasma exchange machine that injects replacement fluids to increase the yield per patient from the standard 400ml to up to 3000ml. 
Once he has enough volunteers he says he will revert to standard extraction levels but for the time being, and as Iraq’s COVID epidemic continues to spread, Abdullah is sticking to the higher-yield procedure. 
He is hopeful his methods will eventually be vetted and adopted abroad. 
“I encourage people to come and donate. But most people are afraid, I don’t know why,” said donor Basim Jassem, before posing for pictures with his super-sized plasma bag. 
“They take it from (us) and replace it with a replacement fluid. There is nothing special about it.” 
Iraq’s COVID death toll stands at just over 1,250, with more than 34,500 people infected, according to health ministry figures.

By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda 
SANTIAGO, June 24 (Reuters) - Chilean state miner Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, on Wednesday reported the death of a third worker who had contracted the new coronavirus. 
The death will pile further pressure on the country`s economically key copper mining industry as unions seek greater protection for workers. 
It was reported by Codelco in an internal statement sent to Chuquicamata division workers and shared with Reuters by the Copper Workers Federation (FTC), which groups the state’s miner’s unions. 
The victim was identified in the memo as José Alberto Levancini, an employee at Chuquicamata. 
The memo did not state the cause of death but said Levancini had contracted the coronavirus outside of work. 
The FTC told Reuters it had been told by Chuquicamata union leaders the man contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, at the division. 
Codelco declined to comment on the contents of the memo, or the FTC’s claims. 
Levancini’s death was the second at Chuquicamata: the first COVID death reported by Codelco on June 6 was a 48-year-old man working at the mine’s crushing unit. The company confirmed a second death at its separate Ministro Hales mine over the weekend. 
The deaths come as Chile faces its toughest weeks so far of the pandemic with 254,416 cases and 4,731 confirmed deaths reported by the government on Wednesday. 
Chile’s copper miners have maintained production with skeleton staff since the pandemic outbreak in March but have recently tightened health protocols amid growing pressure from unions. 
Codelco has announced a strengthening of safety measures including a 14-day-on, 14-day-off shift schedule and the suspension of some construction projects. 
“We will continue to intensify all our efforts to face this pandemic, with the basic premise of protecting the health and safety of our workers,” the company said in Wednesday’s memo. 
Chile´s Geology and Mining Service said on Wednesday it was meeting with the mining industry to discuss strengthening health protocols. The agency’s director Alfonso Domeyko said miners had stressed to him the importance of workers practicing “self-care” measures in their communities as well as at work.

The region has emerged as a new global hotspot for the fast-spreading pandemic as deaths surpassed 100,000 this week and cases have tripled from 690,000 one month ago to 2 million. 
High poverty levels and large informal sectors - which mean many workers cannot afford to quarantine - have combined with overcrowding in cities and inadequate public healthcare, particularly in isolated rural communities, to hamstring Latin America’s fight to stem the contagion. 
Brazil is expected to exceed 166,000 deaths and Mexico 88,000, according to the forecast from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru are each forecast to see over 10,000 fatalities, while 15 nations including Paraguay, Uruguay and Belize are seen with fewer than 1,000 deaths each. 
“Several Latin American countries are facing explosive trajectories, while others are containing infections effectively,” said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. 
IHME researchers warned that the loss of life could surge even higher than the already-grim forecast if mandates on mask wearing and social distancing are relaxed. 
In a worst-case scenario, the COVID-19 death toll could climb to 340,476 people in Brazil and 151,433 people in Mexico, the report said. 
The leaders of Brazil and Mexico have been chastised for not taking the virus seriously enough and pushing for a reopening of their economies before the virus has been tamed. 
“Brazil is at a grim tipping point. ... Unless and until the government takes sustained and enforced measures to slow transmission, the nation will continue its tragic upward trajectory of infections and deaths,” Murray said. 
As Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has continued to downplay the seriousness of the health crisis, Latin America’s largest nation has tallied nearly 1.2 million cases and 53,830 deaths. 
Transmission could be cut in half in communities where people are wearing masks when leaving their homes, according to the IHME. 
“Increased testing and use of masks are important tools in reducing the toll of this pandemic in Mexico, in addition to keeping healthy distance,” said Dr. Rafael Lozano, director of Health Systems at IHME. 
If mask use rises to 95%, Brazil could see as few as 147,431 deaths and Mexico’s forecasted death toll could fall to 79,652, the researchers said.

Lauren Young and Michelle Nichols of Reuters spoke with David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), as part of our #AskReuters series. Below are edited highlights. 
Lauren Young: How is the pandemic impacting refugee populations? 
David Miliband: Refugees and displaced people around the world face a triple emergency: conflict and displacement, COVID-19 and the global economic crisis it has generated, and now the clear failure of global leadership to act to prevent and treat the disease. 
The world is experiencing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the contractions in economic activity in response to COVID-19 are having a disproportionate impact on hunger in conflict-affected states. 
Vulnerable people in developing countries need a cash boost of $1.7 billion over the next six months to prevent from going hungry as a result of this recession. 
Michelle Nichols: The U.S. is taking fewer and fewer refugees. What other countries are destinations, and what is the resettlement outlook when they arrive there? 
DM: The top refugee-hosting countries include Turkey (3.6 million), Colombia (1.8 million), Pakistan, Uganda and Germany. 
Having visited Colombia last year, I am particularly overwhelmed by the outlook of Venezuelan refugees when they arrive in Colombia. They have lost everything. Colombia has extended an extraordinary welcome but services remain overstretched. More funding and long-term support are required to meet the growing needs in the country and region, including permanent resettlement to higher-income countries. 
Over 71,000 Venezuelans have returned from Colombia back to Venezuela after the pandemic made it impossible for them to make a living, with many taking the journey by foot. IRC is providing healthcare, food, water and COVID-19 testing to those returning. 
Lauren Young: The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is considering a proposal to reopen a border crossing from Iraq into Syria for six months to allow aid deliveries to help combat the coronavirus. Opposition by Russia and China shut it down in January. What's your message to them? (Read more in this Reuters article: here) 
DM: It is clear that time is running out - and the UNSC must act now. This way, millions of Syrians are not denied access to timely, life-saving humanitarian assistance. The border crossing is a critical lifeline providing food, shelter, hygiene, and medical services. 
Few decisions are so grave as this one, particularly in the midst of this pandemic. Without this cross-border mechanism to Syria, simply put, lives will be lost. Only 31% of the healthcare facilities in Northeast Syria that were previously supported have been supplied, and NGOs are unable to fill these gaps. The UNSC has the power to address these gaps by reopening the border crossing. 
Lauren Young: What gives you hope now? 
DM: I always like to say that if you look at the statistics - the fact that 1% of humanity is now displaced - you get depressed. But if you look at the clients that we serve and the resilience of the human spirit, that gives you hope.

The loans are set to benefit companies including those controlled by Italy’s Enel Spa, Spain’s Iberdrola , Portugal’s EDP and China’s State Grid, in addition to major local utilities such as Cemig, Equatorial Energia SA and Energisa SA. 
Caixa Econômica Federal withdrew from the transaction, someone involved in the bank talks said. 
“BNDES, BB, Santander, Itau and Bradesco are the cornerstone of the operation. They are likely to get the biggest tickets,” the source said.

The University of Michigan said on Friday its measure of consumer sentiment rose only 0.5 point among residents in the South in June. Southern states, including Texas, South Carolina and Florida, which had reopened by mid-May, are reporting a surge in cases of the respiratory illness. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday ordered bars to close down again and restaurants to scale back service. 
“While most consumers believe that economic conditions could hardly worsen from the recent shutdown of the national economy, prospective growth in the economy is more closely tied to progress against the coronavirus,” said Richard Curtin, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers chief economist. 
“The early reopening of the economy has undoubtedly restored jobs and incomes, but it has come at the probable cost of an uptick in the spread of the virus.” 
In the West, where coronavirus infections have also jumped despite early adoption of stringent measures to slow the spread of the disease, consumer sentiment increased 3.3 points in June. 
In contrast, sentiment among residents in the Northeast soared by a record 19.1 points this month. State and local governments in the Northeast are gradually reopening their economies while monitoring COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. 
Curtin attributed the surge in confidence to “residents apparently expecting the later and more gradual reopening to produce at worst a negligible increase in infections.” 
He predicted that the resurgence of the virus would undercut consumer demand in the southern and western regions and might even temper spending in the Northeast. 
The survey also found that consumers’ confidence in government economic policies dropped in June to its lowest since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.

Mainland China reported seven new asymptomatic patients, who tested positive for COVID-19 but showed no clinical symptoms such as a fever, down from 12 a day earlier. 
The national health authority does not include asymptomatic patients in its tally of confirmed cases. 
The death toll stood at 4,634, unchanged since mid-May.

The pledging summit, part of a joint initiative by the EU executive and advocacy group Global Citizen, also included a globally televised and streamed fundraising concert featuring Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Shakira, Chloe X Halle, Usher and others. 
The Commission together with the European Investment Bank pledged 4.9 billion euros ($5.50 billion), the United States $545 million, Germany 383 million euros, Canada C$300 million ($219 million)and Qatar $10 million. Forty governments took part in the summit. 
The money will be used for COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines, and also to support the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities. 
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was crucial that everyone who needed it should have access to a vaccine. 
“I am trying to convince high-income countries to reserve vaccines not only for themselves but also for low- and middle income countries. This is a stress test for solidarity,” she said. 
British Premier Boris Johnson concurred. 
“If and when an effective vaccine is found, then we as world leaders have moral duty to ensure that it is truly available to all,” he said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron was adamant about pooling efforts together. 
“Let’s refuse an every man for himself approach, let’s continue to move forward together,” he said. 
Italy, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, echoed his sentiment. 
The EU is championing global cooperation in efforts to control and end the pandemic, in contrast to the United States and China’s focus on national initiatives.

Governor Gavin Newsom’s order for bars to close in seven counties, including Los Angeles, is the first major rollback of efforts to reopen the economy in the most populous U.S. state. On Friday, Texas and Florida ordered all bars to close. 
The surge in COVID-19 cases has been most pronounced in several Southern and Western states that did not follow health officials’ recommendations to wait for a steady decline in cases before reopening their economies. 
For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases leapt by more than 40,000, one of the largest surges in the world. 
Even in states where cases have been declining for weeks, bars have been a source of outbreaks. One bar in East Lansing, Michigan has been linked to more than 85 cases, according to local health officials who say that number is likely to rise. 
In addition to bars, Texas shuttered tubing and rafting business on Friday to try to avoid crowds like those seen on Saturday in Arizona along the Salt River east of Phoenix. 
As temperatures rose to above 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), dozens of people climbed into inflatable inner tubes with coolers and took to the water to escape the heat. Very few wore masks. 
Some beaches in Florida are also closing ahead of next weekend’s Fourth of July holiday, which would have drawn large crowds. 
In Arizona, cases have risen by 267% so far in June and jumped by a record 3,857 cases on Sunday, the eighth record-breaking increase this month. Georgia reported a record increase of 2,225 cases on Sunday. Fifteen states, including California, Florida and Texas, saw record rises in cases last week. 
WEAR A MASK 
Just a day after he sounded a note of optimism about the U.S. response to the pandemic and said the country was in “a much better place,” Vice President Mike Pence canceled events to campaign for Republican President Donald Trump’s re-election in Florida and Arizona due to the outbreak, campaign officials said on Saturday. 
In an interview with CBS, Pence said he was confident that there were enough health care supplies and capacity to deal with the spike in cases. 
He also defended Trump’s refusal to directly ask Americans to wear masks or to wear one in public himself, even as Texas Governor Greg Abbott and others say the widespread use of masks will be critical to be able to reopen the economy. 
“We believe people should wear masks wherever social distancing is not possible, wherever it’s indicated by either state or local authorities,” Pence told CBS. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has criticized the administration’s response to the pandemic that has killed more than 125,000 Americans. She told ABC News on Sunday that mandating the use of masks across the country was long overdue. 
Global coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday according to a Reuters tally, marking a major milestone in the spread of the respiratory disease that has so far killed almost half a million people in seven months.

Widodo made the remarks in a cabinet meeting on June 18, the video of which was released by his office on Sunday. 
“I see that many of us are working as though things are normal. That’s what’s irritating me. Don’t you have feelings? This is a crisis,” Widodo said in the video. 
“I will take any extraordinary measures for our 267 million people, for the nation. It can be disbanding agencies, can be a reshuffle, I have thought of everything,” he said, adding that he may also issue more emergency rules if needed. 
The president also complained to his ministers of slow government spending in the face of a dire global economic outlook. 
New COVID-19 cases in Indonesia continued to rise even as the country eased movement restrictions and allowed some re-openings of businesses this month. 
On Saturday the country reported its biggest daily rise in infections with 1,385 new cases, and reported another 1,198 on Sunday, taking the total to 54,010 so far. It has recorded 2,754 deaths, the highest in East Asia outside China. 
Widodo’s government has pledged to spend nearly $50 billion on public health, social protection and relief measures.

Just two hours after she went into labour, baby Theo was born weighing just 2lb 4oz (1 kg) at the intensive care unit at Burnley General Hospital’s maternity wing in northern England. 
Father Leon Stubbs, 35, was only allowed to see Kirsty 20 minutes beforehand and after Theo’s birth, they had just an hour together before he had to go home. 
In the weeks following the stressful events in the early hours of April 20, the parents then had to take turns to visit their son as he grew stronger in an incubator. 
It was during this time that a Reuters photographer took a picture of tiny Theo with his limbs outstretched being handed to his mother by a nurse wearing gloves and mask, an image that featured prominently in British newspapers and on online news sites globally. 
It was an absolutely horrendous time, Kirsty, 33, recalled, and due to COVID-19 the family could not see him together. 
But this week, Theo - now weighing in at 6lb 4oz - was finally allowed to go home to meet his older brother, 16-month-old Arlo, for the first time in person. 
“He’s fabulous, he’s done so well,” Kirsty told Reuters as she was leaving the hospital with Theo and Leon. “Amazing, absolutely amazing - I just can’t wait for his brother to see him.” 
As staff who had looked after Theo waved them farewell, a tearful Kirsty paid tribute to what they had done for her. 
“I can’t thank them enough,” she said. “They’re here to sort the babies out but they get you through it as well. I honestly don’t have enough words to thank them, they’re amazing.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently charged a Florida-based investment adviser for failing to provide required books and records during an examination. 
According to the complaint[go-ri.tr.com/J2c5ED], the adviser did not cooperate with various document and information requests, and claimed that by doing so he would risk violating the states stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The SEC also charged that the adviser was ineligible for SEC registration and improperly registered itself as an internet investment adviser. 
A case of this nature highlights that multiple compliance failures and that using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for deliberate non-compliance will not be looked at favorably by the SEC and its examiners. 
SEC COMPLAINT 
The SEC on June 3 filed suit against E*Hedge Securities, Inc., based on the firms failure to respond to a request for documents and information during an examination, in violation of the Investment Advisers Act[go-ri.tr.com/TAKWBd]. E*Hedges President, Devon W. Parks, is also named as a defendant in the complaint. 
A message requesting comment from E*Hedge was left, without response, at the firm’s most recent office phone number. 
The SEC complaint seeks relief including an order of expedited discovery and the imposition of civil penalties. 
REGULATORY EVASION 
The SEC describes a history of regulatory evasion by E*Hedge, stemming from a 2017 exam request that resulted in unanswered phone calls and undelivered exam request lists. 
E*Hedge continued to thwart attempts by the local SEC exam staff despite having more than 45 days to comply with the examiner’s requests. 
Finally, in April of 2020, the exam staff made initial contact with E*Hedge through Parks via telephone to announce the examination and sent follow-up correspondence regarding the examination to email addresses Parks provided. 
Parks then gave a variety of reasons why he could not cooperate with the examination, including Florida’s stay-at-home order. Parks did not specify how his activities to cooperate with the exam would violate the order. 
Soon after contact, Parks asked for an extension to produce documents and it was granted by the SEC examiners. 
During a subsequent phone conversation, Parks wouldn’t answer any questions and requested all exam inquiries be in writing. Therefore, the SEC examiners sent questions via secure email, but soon after, the SEC was able to see Parks had never accessed them. 
To date, E*Hedge and Parks have failed to respond, produce any records or communicate further with the exam staff. 
Parks claimed that the stay-at-home order issued by the state of Florida prevented him from cooperating with the April 2020 examination. However, the order was lifted on May 18th and E*Hedge managed to publish new blog posts on a COVID-19-focused website and host a webinar between late April and May 2020. 
The website touted investment opportunities in connection with COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostic tests. 
INTERNET ADVISER 
An adviser seeking SEC registration must be qualified or expect to be qualified in 120 days. For most firms, the eligibility is achieved by having regulatory assets under management of $100 million or more. 
However, there are other ways to qualify; a firm may be a multi-state adviser, related to an SEC-registered adviser or be an exempt reporting adviser, among others. 
The internet adviser qualification is often misunderstood and requires very specific ways of conducting business to qualify. 
A firm is eligible if: 
 Investment advice provided to clients is through an interactive website. An interactive website means a website in which computer software-based models or applications provide investment advice based on personal information to each client submitted through the website. Other forms of online or internet investment advice do not qualify for this exemption; 
 The firm provides investment advice to all its clients exclusively through the interactive website, except that a firm may provide investment advice to fewer than 15 clients through other means during the previous 12 months; and 
 The adviser maintains records demonstrating that it provides investment advice to clients exclusively through the interactive website in accordance with these limits. According to the complaint, E*Hedge did not have any clients and did not provide advice through an interactive website, therefore, it would not be eligible for SEC registration. 
Most likely, the firm would have had to apply for registration with the proper state regulator to offer investment advice. 
TAKEAWAYS 
A firm may be able avoid an SEC examination for a limited period, but eventually the SEC will act and charge the firm and any individuals involved with evasion. 
In addition, any firm that qualifies for SEC registration must be certain that it achieves each element of the rule and be prepared to demonstrate compliance and records during examinations. 
Lastly, the SEC will take any COVID-19 considerations seriously but it is not an excuse for non-compliance.

NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stimulus efforts may be able to support corporate cash flows for the summer, but economic risk from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to extend far beyond that, Bridgewater Associates Co-Chief Investment Officer Bob Prince said on Wednesday. 
U.S. corporate income has been decimated by global business shutdowns and record layoffs. Unprecedented Federal Reserve measures to back financial markets and Treasury Department programs to fund individuals and small businesses can tide companies over for the summer if incomes remain low, he said. 
But the coronavirus risk will probably last 18-24 months, Prince said at the Bloomberg Invest Global conference. “I refer to that as a duration mismatch.” 
Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater has roughly $138 billion in assets and manages the world’s largest hedge fund. 
Though some companies may falter because of the limits of the U.S. stimulus operations, Prince also said those programs have added companies to a class considered “too big to fail.” The designation was given to U.S. banks bailed out during the 2007-2009 financial crisis because they were deemed systemically important. 
“The government is now involved in making choices about where capital goes and we can call that ‘state capitalism,’” said Prince. 
Four major tools can be used to promote recovery from a recession, Prince said, citing monetary policy, fiscal policy, debt restructuring and currency devaluation. 
Since U.S. fiscal and monetary policy has been loosened, Prince said the question for Bridgewater and its clients is, “Do we transition to debt restructurings and currency devaluation? And from there, what is the status of the dollar as a reserve currency?”

The European Commission is due in September to set out measures to accelerate the creation of a capital markets union or CMU, made more urgent by Britain’s departure from the bloc and the need to recapitalise companies after the COVID-19 shock. 
Efforts so far have been patchy, with bank loans still providing most funding for companies, rather than stock or bond issues. 
But most EU states remain opposed to a major centralisation of supervision, such as an EU version of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, preferring to maintain a national role in markets. 
“Centralised supervision and regulation is very important and you see this in other places where there are very deep and extensive debt and equity capital markets,” said Kevin Wall, chief executive of Barclays Europe. 
He said the political and economic stars were aligned and it was in every EU state’s interest to have a deeper and more liquid capital market, Wall said. 
“Over the last few months in the crisis... we have seen, relatively, a lot more equity issuance in the UK, in the (United) States, than we have across Europe. One of the reasons is the capital markets union, its development and progress,” Wall said. 
Verena Ross, executive director of the EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said having uneven supervision and detailed national rules were a major barrier to a genuine CMU. 
But the “mixed model” of national and EU supervision is likely to stay, she said. 
Danuta Hubner, a member of the European Parliament, said it was time to get on with creating a CMU that makes the EU globally competitive. 
“We cannot spend the next 10 years reflecting on what is more important,” she said.

Instead she found herself working an office job to make ends meet. 
The coronavirus has put millions of artists around the world out of work and caused huge financial loss, particularly as some, like Rexx, are not eligible for emergency state help for the self-employed because of a lack of formal contracts. 
“Four months ago we were negotiating a tour in Asia and the release of my debut album,” Rexx, which is a stage name, told Reuters. 
The single was not released and the tour never got off the ground. She now works from home as a freelance assistant to a managing director of a firm in Brussels. 
Everything, including studio recording in Britain, is on hold, said Rexx, who declined to give her real name.   
“I have had to find other ways to make money to pay my bills,” she said while answering corporate emails on a computer screen. 
Still dressed in black and with purple hair, Rexx has returned to office work she sought to leave behind in 2014 when she tried for a career as a singer, inspired by her youth, when she sung on Belgian television aged 10. 
Her desk is far from the drama of her promotional videos where, with feathers in her hair and sparkling eye make-up, she sings both on horseback and in chains in a castle. 
But like her lyrics about the phoenix rising from the ashes, she hopes that with the easing of lockdowns across Europe from July she may be back on stage. 
“I will definitely be sending emails to promoters and bookers to let them know I am available,” she said.

It said $3.4 billion had been contributed to date, leaving a funding gap of $27.9 billion, of which $13.7 billion was “urgently needed”. 
The WHO initiative aims to scale up delivery of 500 million tests and 245 million courses of treatments to low- and middle-income countries by mid-2021, it said in a statement. 
It also aims to scale up delivery of 2 billion vaccines doses, including 1 billion to be bought by low- and middle-income countries, by the end of 2021. 
The WHO is working with a large coalition of drug-development, funding and distribution organisations under what it is calling the ACT-Accelerator Hub. 
In an update on the ACT-Accelerator initiative, launched in April to speed up research and development for the new disease, the WHO and global health groups said the coronavirus pandemic is still threatening millions of lives and scores of economies. 
“The investment required is significant, but it pales in significance when compared to the cost of COVID-19,” it said in a statement. 
“The total cost of the ACT-Accelerator’s work is less than a tenth of what the IMF estimates the global economy is losing every month due to the pandemic. 468,000 thousand people have already lost their lives.”

SAO PAULO, June 25 (Reuters) - An appeals court in Brazil’s southern Rio Grande do Sul state ruled that a plant operated by meatpacker JBS SA must close, overturning a lower labor court decision allowing it to open after an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, according to a statement from the state’s labor prosecutors on Thursday. 
The JBS chicken plant in the town of Passo Fundo had been authorized to reopen on May 21, after being closed on April 24, following an outbreak. 
JBS declined comment on the new ruling. 
The plant, which employs more than 2,600 people, has capacity to process 320,000 birds per day, JBS said when it reopened. 
Amid a spate of outbreaks at Brazilian meatpacking plants, earlier this week another court ruled JBS must test all workers for coronavirus at its Três Passos pork plant, also in Rio Grande do Sul. 
On the day the ruling was announced, the state labor prosecutors had said the number of meatpacking plants with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus was 32 in Brazil’s southernmost state. 
As of June 23, almost 5,000 workers at meat plants had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Rio Grande do Sul, or 25.14% of the state’s total 19,710 cases, the labor prosecutors said. 
At Três Passos, which remains open, a 48-year-old JBS employee died from COVID-19 complications, the state labor prosecutors said. 
Citing local health authorities, the prosecutors also said 117 JBS workers, out of 1,017 at Três Passos, had tested positive for the virus before JBS’s own testing began. 
JBS said in a statement to Reuters that it regretted the death of its worker, who had been employed by the company for 27 years. The company said he was off duty since June 8, and died 15 days later. 
JBS has been offering assistance to his family. (Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)"

But in an online seminar on Friday Kuroda said the central bank saw no immediate need to cut interest rates, and instead will focus on easing corporate funding strains and stabilising markets with its lending facility and asset purchases. 
“Japan’s economy has been in an extremely severe situation ... In the second quarter, we’ll likely see considerable negative growth,” Kuroda said. 
“At this moment, we didn’t see the need to further lower the entire yield curve. Of course, if necessary we will do that. But now, we don’t think it’s necessary,” he said. 
The BOJ eased policy in March and April, mainly by boosting asset buying and creating lending schemes to channel funds to companies hit by the pandemic. It has kept its interest-rate targets unchanged. 
Kuroda said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Japan’s economy will gradually recover from the second half of this year, allowing the BOJ to scale back its crisis-response steps. 
“Once the impact of COVID-19 on the economy has subsided, the economy starts to recover and comes back to a normal growth path, then of course our extraordinary measures may be gradually curtailed,” Kuroda said. 
“But then, we have to achieve our 2% inflation target,” he said. “That’s unlikely to be met in the short run. The BOJ’s expanded balance sheet would not be normalised until 2% inflation is achieved.” 
Under yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term yields around zero. It also introduced several crisis-response tools, including a lending facility to ease funding strains that expires in March next year.

Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath, the virus that causes COVID-19 attacks many organ systems, in some cases causing catastrophic damage. 
“We thought this was only a respiratory virus. Turns out, it goes after the pancreas. It goes after the heart. It goes after the liver, the brain, the kidney and other organs. We didn’t appreciate that in the beginning,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. 
In addition to respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 can experience blood clotting disorders that can lead to strokes, and extreme inflammation that attacks multiple organ systems. The virus can also cause neurological complications that range from headache, dizziness and loss of taste or smell to seizures and confusion. 
And recovery can be slow, incomplete and costly, with a huge impact on quality of life. 
The broad and diverse manifestations of COVID-19 are somewhat unique, said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. 
With influenza, people with underlying heart conditions are also at higher risk of complications, Khan said. What is surprising about this virus is the extent of the complications occurring outside the lungs. 
Kahn believes there will be a huge healthcare expenditure and burden for individuals who have survived COVID-19. 
LENGTHY REHAB FOR MANY 
Patients who were in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks will need to spend extensive time in rehab to regain mobility and strength. 
“It can take up to seven days for every one day that you’re hospitalized to recover that type of strength,” Kahn said. “It’s harder the older you are, and you may never get back to the same level of function.” 
While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization, but are still suffering months after first becoming infected. 
Studies are just getting underway to understand the long-term effects of infection, Jay Butler, deputy director of infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a telephone briefing on Thursday. 
“We hear anecdotal reports of people who have persistent fatigue, shortness of breath,” Butler said. “How long that will last is hard to say.” 
While coronavirus symptoms typically resolve in two or three weeks, an estimated 1 in 10 experience prolonged symptoms, Dr. Helen Salisbury of the University of Oxford wrote in the British Medical Journal on Tuesday. 
Salisbury said many of her patients have normal chest X-rays and no sign of inflammation, but they are still not back to normal. 
“If you previously ran 5k three times a week and now feel breathless after a single flight of stairs, or if you cough incessantly and are too exhausted to return to work, then the fear that you may never regain your previous health is very real,” she wrote. 
Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine, reviewed current scientific literature and found about half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had neurological complications, such as dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness and muscle pain.

Koralnik, whose findings were published in the Annals of Neurology, has started an outpatient clinic for COVID-19 patients to study whether these neurological problems are temporary or permanent. 
Kahn sees parallels with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Much of the early focus was on deaths. 
“In recent years, we’ve been very focused on the cardiovascular complications of HIV survivorship,” Kahn said.

Governor Gavin Newsom’s order for bars to close in Los Angeles and six other counties followed moves by Texas and Florida to shut all their bars on Friday. Public health officials in California and throughout the nation have identified bars as the most risky non-essential businesses currently open, the state said. 
Consuming alcohol reduces inhibitions that leads to less compliance with wearing masks and keeping apart, health officials warn. Bars are also generally noisy, requiring patrons to shout, which spreads droplets more widely. 
The surge in COVID-19 cases has been most pronounced in several Southern and Western states that did not follow health officials’ recommendations to wait for a steady decline in cases before reopening their economies. 
For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases leapt by more than 40,000, one of the largest surges in the world. In many of these states, people under 35 have accounted for a large percentage of new cases. More tests are also coming back positive, up to 25% in some areas. 
Even in states where cases have been declining for weeks, bars have been a source of outbreaks. One bar in East Lansing, Michigan has been linked to more than 85 cases, according to local health officials who say that number is likely to rise. 
In addition to bars, Texas shuttered tubing and rafting business on Friday to try to avoid crowds like those seen on Saturday in Arizona along the Salt River east of Phoenix. 
As temperatures rose to above 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), dozens of people climbed into inflatable inner tubes with coolers and took to the water to escape the heat. Very few wore masks. 
Some beaches in Florida are also closing ahead of next weekend’s Fourth of July holiday, which would have drawn large crowds. 
In Arizona, cases have risen by 267% so far in June and jumped by a record 3,857 cases on Sunday, the eighth record-breaking increase this month. Georgia reported a record increase of 2,225 cases on Sunday. Fifteen states, including California, Florida and Texas, saw record rises in cases last week. 
WEAR A MASK 
Just a day after he sounded a note of optimism about the U.S. response to the pandemic and said the country was in “a much better place,” Vice President Mike Pence canceled events to campaign for Republican President Donald Trump’s re-election in Florida and Arizona due to the outbreak, campaign officials said on Saturday. 
On Sunday, Pence traveled to Texas and attended a service at the First Baptist Church of Dallas where a 100-member choir sang without masks. Pence did wear a face covering while sitting in the audience, according to a video. 
In early March, a church choir in Washington state gathered for a rehearsal before the state issued a stay-at-home order. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 87% of the singers developed COVID-19. Two members of the choir died. 
Pence urged Texans to follow local laws requiring masks and said towns and counties in about half the state are requiring face coverings in public. Pence has defended Trump’s refusal to directly ask all Americans to wear masks. 
Global coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday according to a Reuters tally, marking a major milestone in the spread of the respiratory disease that has so far killed almost half a million people in seven months.

TV images showed around 100 Universitatea supporters surrounding the team bus after Tuesday’s 2-1 home win over FC Botosani, setting off smoke bombs and fireworks before giving high fives and hugging players who got off the vehicle. 
However, LPF general secretary Justin Stefan said the governing body which runs the top-flight would not take any action against the club because the players had not been inside the ground where the match took place. 
“Craiova does not risk anything at the moment,” Stefan said. “The club cannot be sanctioned according to the sanitary protocol if the players and fans were not inside the stadium.” 
The Romanian league resumed on June 13 with matches behind closed doors, ending a three-month break due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Romania’s football federation (FRF) suspended all soccer in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus has so far killed more than 1,500 people in the Black Sea state, with nearly 25,000 confirmed infections. 
The game between Universitatea and FC Botosani was due to be played on June 12 but was postponed after the visiting side’s doctor tested positive for COVID-19. 
Craiova’s victory on Tuesday, the team’s second straight win since ex-Lazio defender Cristiano Bergodi was appointed coach, kept alive their chances of claiming a fifth league title. 
The Students, who reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals and the European Cup quarter-finals in the 1980s, are second in the standings with 32 points, four behind reigning champions CFR Cluj. The two teams meet in a crunch clash on Sunday.

Churches in the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, have been able to hold services since May 1 following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, provided they adhere to official social distancing and hygiene rules. 
“This situation shows how important it is that all of us stay alert and avoid becoming careless, especially now during the easing of restrictions. The virus is still there and will spread,” Hesse state health minister Kai Klose said. 
He said the authorities hoped that identifying those who attended the service at a Baptist church on May 10 would help prevent others being infected. 
It was not immediately clear whether all the 107 with the coronavirus attended the service, or whether the tally includes people who were infected by those who did.

The scheme’s update comes as France and other European countries that set up furlough schemes to save jobs grapple with how to encourage firms to put workers back into their jobs despite a still fragile economic outlook, while keeping down the cost to the public purse. 
Companies had put 7.8 million workers on furloughs or reduced schedules as of the end of May, Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said last week. 
From Oct. 1, workers will get 60% of their normal gross wages under the scheme, down from 70% currently, President Emmanuel Macron told employers and unions. Meanwhile, the state will reimburse employers up to 60% of the cost, instead of 85% currently. 
However, a company can only tap the existing furlough arrangements for up to six months, and on Wednesday the government also outlined a new longer-term programme that is more generous for the employee and company, but demands commitments to safeguarding jobs. 
The programme will allow workers to receive up to 70% of gross wages, with the state reimbursing firms up to 85% if the programme is tapped before July and 80% afterwards. 
While employers will have to commit to saving jobs, unions will have to support a company using the new scheme. Meanwhile, workers’ time not spent on the job would have to be used for training, with the state taking on up to 80% of the cost.

Lauren Young and Michelle Nichols of Reuters spoke with David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), as part of our #AskReuters series. Below are edited highlights. 
Lauren Young: How is the pandemic impacting refugee populations? 
David Miliband: Refugees and displaced people around the world face a triple emergency: conflict and displacement, COVID-19 and the global economic crisis it has generated, and now the clear failure of global leadership to act to prevent and treat the disease. 
The world is experiencing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the contractions in economic activity in response to COVID-19 are having a disproportionate impact on hunger in conflict-affected states. 
Vulnerable people in developing countries need a cash boost of $1.7 billion over the next six months to prevent from going hungry as a result of this recession. 
Michelle Nichols: The U.S. is taking fewer and fewer refugees. What other countries are destinations, and what is the resettlement outlook when they arrive there? 
DM: The top refugee-hosting countries include Turkey (3.6 million), Colombia (1.8 million), Pakistan, Uganda and Germany. 
Having visited Colombia last year, I am particularly overwhelmed by the outlook of Venezuelan refugees when they arrive in Colombia. They have lost everything. Colombia has extended an extraordinary welcome but services remain overstretched. More funding and long-term support are required to meet the growing needs in the country and region, including permanent resettlement to higher-income countries. 
Over 71,000 Venezuelans have returned from Colombia back to Venezuela after the pandemic made it impossible for them to make a living, with many taking the journey by foot. IRC is providing healthcare, food, water and COVID-19 testing to those returning. 
Lauren Young: The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is considering a proposal to reopen a border crossing from Iraq into Syria for six months to allow aid deliveries to help combat the coronavirus. Opposition by Russia and China shut it down in January. What's your message to them? (Read more in this Reuters article: here) 
DM: It is clear that time is running out - and the UNSC must act now. This way, millions of Syrians are not denied access to timely, life-saving humanitarian assistance. The border crossing is a critical lifeline providing food, shelter, hygiene, and medical services. 
Few decisions are so grave as this one, particularly in the midst of this pandemic. Without this cross-border mechanism to Syria, simply put, lives will be lost. Only 31% of the healthcare facilities in Northeast Syria that were previously supported have been supplied, and NGOs are unable to fill these gaps. The UNSC has the power to address these gaps by reopening the border crossing. 
Lauren Young: What gives you hope now? 
DM: I always like to say that if you look at the statistics - the fact that 1% of humanity is now displaced - you get depressed. But if you look at the clients that we serve and the resilience of the human spirit, that gives you hope.

“There will be outbreaks...we can’t go stop-go-stop-go and we can’t flick the light on-and-off-on-and-off-and-on-and-off,” Morrison said, referring to restrictions to curb the spread of the virulent disease. 
“So what I’m saying is we are going ahead, we built the protections to deal with outbreaks.” 
Australia reported its first COVID-19 death in more than a month on Wednesday, as concerns about a second wave of infections saw thousands of people queue, sometimes for hours, to be tested for the virus.

The number of online orders grew by 65,7% in the same comparison, mostly driven by three categories: cosmetics and perfumes, furniture and eletronics, according to data compiled by Brazilian ecommerce consultancy Compre&amp;Confie and industry body ABComm. 
“Consumers are more and more involved in online shopping particularly in categories related to basic needs and efforts to prevent COVID-19,” said André Dias, director at Compre&amp;Confie. 
Brazil’s ecommerce growth was also boosted as smaller merchants and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have pushed to boost their own online sales, the survey showed. 
“It is possible to start selling online quickly and simply, without the need for large investments,” Mauricio Salvador, president of Brazilian ecommerce association ABComm, added in a statement. 
Brazil’s Northeastern region posted a 60.9% rise in online sales in the first five months of 2020, marking the highest percentage growth among all areas. 
Major ecommerce firms such as MercadoLibre and Amazon.com have been investing to bolster their logistics infrastructure in the Northeast of Brazil in a push to expedite deliveries and challenge local retailers such as Magazine Luiza, B2W Companhia Digital and Via Varejo.

Victoria state reported 20 overnight cases, Victoria Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne, taking the state tally to nearly 1,900 after recording 17 on Tuesday and 16 the day before. 
The upswing in new cases in Victoria has sparked fears of a second wave, with 241 cases in the state so far identified as community transmission, an increase of eight from Tuesday. 
Authorities in Victoria, which has become the virus hotspot in Australia, have been trying to contain the spread of the virus in half a dozen suburbs in the largest city of Melbourne hit by a spike in cases. 
The state on the weekend extended its state of emergency for another month and reimposed restrictions on gatherings to stem a spike in coronavirus infections after seeing a sharp rise in daily infections. 
Despite the spike in cases in Victoria, the neighbouring state of New South Wales (NSW) said it would not introduce a hard border closure between the states. 
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, however, urged people in the state to avoid travelling to its southern neighbour. 
After enforcing restrictions early in the coronavirus outbreak compared to most other countries, Australia began to ease its lockdown last month to revive its economy after a significant slowdown in infection rates. 
Australia has so far escaped a high number of casualties from the new coronavirus, with just over 7,500 infections and 103 deaths, aided by strict lockdown measures and social distancing rules.

The Bulgarian league resumed on June 5 after an almost three-month break due to the novel coronavirus pandemic with supporters allowed at stadiums but there were a number of violations during many matches. 
“We gave our players the opportunity to play in front of spectators,” Borissov told a government meeting. “What did the fans do? They gathered together, not wearing protective face masks. What do they want to demonstrate?” 
Following the violations in recent weeks, Health Minister Kiril Ananiev issued an order on Monday allowing up to 1,000 spectators in a single stand, urging fans to maintain distance. 
Supporters, however, failed to observe the rule during the Bulgarian Cup semi-final second leg between Levski Sofia and Lokomotiv Plovdiv on Tuesday. 
“There is a new restriction now at 1,000 people in a sector but I see that they do not observe it again,” Borissov said. “If they continue like this, we will most likely close the stadiums (to fans) as (they did) in Germany, Spain and Italy.” 
Sports minister Krasen Kralev on Monday criticised organisers and fans at the Sofia derby between CSKA and Levski for not observing the rules, saying Bulgaria was on the verge of a second COVID-19 wave because of the violations. 
The Eternal derby between bitter rivals CSKA and Levski, the Balkan country’s most popular clubs, took place in front of thousands of closely seated and standing fans on Saturday. 
Bulgaria decided on Wednesday to extend a state of emergency declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak until July 15 after another jump in new registered cases. 
Last week the country reported 606 new COVID-19 cases, its highest weekly rise since the outbreak of the epidemic. 
Some 130 new cases were reported on Wednesday, bringing the total to date to 4,114, with 208 deaths.

The region has emerged as a new global hotspot for the fast-spreading pandemic as deaths surpassed 100,000 this week and cases have tripled from 690,000 one month ago to 2 million. 
High poverty levels and large informal sectors - which mean many workers cannot afford to quarantine - have combined with overcrowding in cities and inadequate public healthcare, particularly in isolated rural communities, to hamstring Latin America’s fight to stem the contagion. 
Brazil is expected to exceed 166,000 deaths and Mexico 88,000, according to the forecast from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru are each forecast to see over 10,000 fatalities, while 15 nations including Paraguay, Uruguay and Belize are seen with fewer than 1,000 deaths each. 
“Several Latin American countries are facing explosive trajectories, while others are containing infections effectively,” said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. 
IHME researchers warned that the loss of life could surge even higher than the already-grim forecast if mandates on mask wearing and social distancing are relaxed. 
In a worst-case scenario, the COVID-19 death toll could climb to 340,476 people in Brazil and 151,433 people in Mexico, the report said. 
The leaders of Brazil and Mexico have been chastised for not taking the virus seriously enough and pushing for a reopening of their economies before the virus has been tamed. 
“Brazil is at a grim tipping point. ... Unless and until the government takes sustained and enforced measures to slow transmission, the nation will continue its tragic upward trajectory of infections and deaths,” Murray said. 
As Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has continued to downplay the seriousness of the health crisis, Latin America’s largest nation has tallied nearly 1.2 million cases and 53,830 deaths. 
Transmission could be cut in half in communities where people are wearing masks when leaving their homes, according to the IHME. 
“Increased testing and use of masks are important tools in reducing the toll of this pandemic in Mexico, in addition to keeping healthy distance,” said Dr. Rafael Lozano, director of Health Systems at IHME. 
If mask use rises to 95%, Brazil could see as few as 147,431 deaths and Mexico’s forecasted death toll could fall to 79,652, the researchers said.

In its bi-annual survey of 823 Canadian exporters conducted online in May, Export Development Canada (EDC) said the confidence figure was the lowest recorded in the history of the survey, which began in 1999. 
Officials shut most non-essential businesses starting in mid-March and urged people to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but in recent weeks regions have begun to reopen. 
“It’s basically two shocks in one. You’ve got longer term protectionism and then you’ve got COVID-19 coming in on top of that,” EDC’s deputy chief economist Stephen Tapp said in an interview. 
More than two-thirds, or 69%, of those surveyed said they expect protectionism to increase in the year ahead, Tapp said, almost double the 35% seen six months ago. Almost 40% said protectionism was affecting their global strategies. 
Earlier this week Canadian minister Jean-Yves Duclos, president of Canada’s Treasury Board, told reporters the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis could trigger a rise in protectionism globally. 
“We need as Canadians to be mindful of the fact that protectionism still exists and runs the risk of being even bigger and an even greater threat as we emerge from the COVID health and economic crisis,” Duclos said. 
About 73% of exporters surveyed told EDC the coronvavirus pandemic had negatively impacted sales, while 14% said sales had been positively affected.

Onex Credit and Oak Hill Advisors are among firms that have sought to include a provision that ties the price at which loans can be added to their portfolios to a leveraged loan index, according to deal documents. Linking the ability to purchase discounted loans without penalty to an index responsive to market volatility would have allowed CLOs to better take advantage of plunging prices in March. Some CLOs have also pushed to lower the minimum price at which the investments can be bought. 
CLO managers want more flexibility to buy distressed loans as defaults pile up, and the health crisis continues. The funds, the largest investors in the US$1.2trn US leveraged loan market, are constrained from buying assets trading below a certain threshold. Such restriction can leave the US$688bn US CLO asset class at a disadvantage vis a vis hedge funds and distressed debt lenders. Stocking up on discounted loans could help funds meet internal tests and boost returns to the most junior investors when the overall performance of the market improved. 
The LPC 100, a cohort of the 100 most liquid US loans, dropped more than 21% from the start of the year to 77.87 cents on the dollar March 23, an almost 11-year low. Prices have since rebounded, and the LPC 100 sat at 93.79 Thursday. 
“When you look at the performance of managers during periods of volatility do you see better outcomes when documents are overly restrictive or when they have a little wiggle room,” said Dan Wohlberg, a director at Eagle Point Credit Management, which invests in CLOs. “Debt and equity investors have come to a determination that a slightly larger toolkit may be advantageous.” 
DISTRESSED FLEXIBILITY 
Many CLOs are permitted to buy loans, typically at 80 or 85 cents and higher, and mark the debt at par. If purchased below that level, a loan would be calculated in CLO tests at the purchase price. 
CLO managers are now looking to tie the price at which a loan can be purchased to an index to account for market volatility rather than a set price. If a discount obligation was defined as a percentage lower than a loan index, it would have allowed managers to take advantage of loans that traded off significantly in March. 
The provision emerged following the 2008 financial crisis but disappeared as markets improved. Now, some market participants want to bring it back. 
“You want CLO managers buying cheap loans; that benefits both the debt and equity,” said Dagmara Michalczuk, a portfolio manager at Tetragon Credit Partners, which invests in CLO equity. 
In the offering documents for Onex Credit’s OCP CLO 2020-18, there is an option for the discount obligation to be tied to a ‘leveraged loan index adjusted price,’ defined as the price of the S&amp;P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index multiplied by 90%. 
Oak Hill is seeking to include similar language in OHA Credit Funding 6, a new fund it is raising, offering a variety of eligible loan indices including the S&amp;P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index, the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Indices, the Deutsche Bank Leveraged Loan Index, the Goldman Sachs/Loan Pricing Corporation Liquid Leveraged Loan Index or the Merrill Lynch Leveraged Loan Index, according to a deal document. 
An Onex spokesperson could not comment. An Oak Hill spokesperson could not be reached. 
Some senior debt investors have pushed back against the provision, wary it would allow a manager to buy too many risky credits. 
There has also been a push to lower the minimum price at which debt can be purchased to 50 cents. According to Sean Solis, a partner at law firm Milbank, many CLOs have a minimum price at which loans can be purchased, often 60-65 cents. 
“There were real opportunities to buy discounted loans in March that were trading in the 50s, but CLOs couldn’t buy,” he said. 
Some investors have even allowed managers to purchase as much as 5% of additional loans below that 50-60 cents threshold because the manager is taking a significant haircut to buy the credit. 
“You want tests that protect noteholders, but you also want to give managers enough flexibility to mitigate risk and generate value,” said Laila Kollmorgen, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, a CLO investor. “It’s a fine line.” 
CLO managers have previously sought the ability to swap deeply distressed or defaulted assets with other similar loans that may offer better recoveries as well as permission to provide rescue financing to distressed companies, Refinitiv LPC has previously reported. 
As markets continue to deal with the pandemic, requests for additional flexibility will persist. 
“In the CLO market, managers, equity and debt investors are coalescing around shared experiences and in some instances saying, ‘managers need the right tools to operate in this market,’” said Wohlberg. “We will continue to see some evolution around these abilities.” (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing by Michelle Sierra)"

The South American nation, which outperformed many of its neighbors early on controlling the virus with a tough lockdown, has seen cases rise fivefold since mid-May with over 2,600 new cases on Thursday alone. The death toll stands at around 1,150. 
The government has eased some restrictions, but maintained a lockdown in Buenos Aires city and province. A new phase of the quarantine is expected to be announced on Friday, with authorities looking to tighten controls on movement. 
“We estimate that the number of infected people will keep rising for the next 20 days or so,” said Juan Ciruzzi, executive director at the Eurnekian hospital in Buenos Aires, adding that this was in part due to loosened quarantine rules. 
“People are moving about more and we do not have the tools to fight it.” 
Infections have risen particularly in poorer neighborhoods in Buenos Aires and on the fringes of the capital, sparking a response from authorities to ramp up testing to help stem the spread. 
Argentina’s government has been looking to revitalize the country’s hard-hit economy, allowing more businesses to open, though parks, schools and offices in the capital remain shut and non-essential workers are mostly confined at home. 
Alejandro Andres Revollini, associate director at the Eurnekian hospital, said case numbers would only really start to fall away from September, with the “top peak” around mid-July. 
“People understand that we are going to have to live with the virus and many of us are going to catch it,” he said.

Rameda, which listed 49% of its shares on the Egyptian exchange last year, has produced quantities enough Anviziram tablets to cover “appropriate numbers of patients in the Egyptian market,” said its CEO Amr Morsy.

Costs for the five-year loans will be passed on to consumers through electric bills, according to energy sector regulator Aneel, noting that the interest rate has yet to be determined. 
The loans are set to benefit companies including those controlled by Italy’s Enel Spa, Spain’s Iberdrola , Portugal’s EDP and China’s State Grid, in addition to major local utilities such as Cemig, Equatorial Energia SA and Energisa SA. 
Caixa Econômica Federal withdrew from the transaction, someone involved in the bank talks said. 
“BNDES, BB, Santander, Itau and Bradesco are the cornerstone of the operation. They are likely to get the biggest tickets,” the source said. 
Those five banks have more incentives to participate because of their significant exposure to the Brazilian power sector.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, issued guidelines on Wednesday allowing some migrant farm workers back to work as farms battle outbreaks that have killed three people and infected hundreds more. 
Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said protocols that separate COVID-19 positive and negative workers must be stringent, and workers’ health must be considered. 
“People can begin to have symptoms anytime during that incubation period and potentially can get sick fairly fast,” she said. “You need to make sure that you screen them for symptoms and enable them to stop working if they’re not feeling well.” 
Canadian farmers rely on some 60,000 temporary foreign workers predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean. Many live in crowded bunkhouses where the virus can spread quickly. 
Sudeshna Nambiar, chief operating officer of Lakeside Produce, a Leamington, Ontario greenhouse operation, welcomed the new policy. She said each employee is responsible for 23 rows in the greenhouse, allowing for ample distancing. 
Lakeside had 13 infections among workers in the spring, but all have recovered. 
“This is the new normal. This is how we have to operate, with more hygiene and social distancing,” she said. 
Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of British Columbia, said the virus is likely to spread if workers return. 
On Wednesday, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture said workers will not be forced to work. 
“This isn’t a community that has a lot of flexibility in their lives,” said Murthy. “Most individuals are not in a place where they can make a free and fair choice.”

The country began easing restrictions put in place in March last month and at the beginning of June allowed people outside for work, worship, exercise or shopping, and let mines and factories to run at full capacity to try to revive the economy. 
It has recorded 118,375 infections of the highly contagious respiratory disease and 2,292 deaths and daily case numbers rose by more than 6,500 on Thursday after less than 1,000 in April. 
But tourism is an important revenue-earner and three months of lockdown has left many businesses fighting for survival. 
“We are continuing with the effort to reactivate the tourism sector so that we can save businesses and jobs in the sector,” Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said in a televised briefing, after warning last month that up to 600,000 jobs were at risk if the sector remained shut until September. 
Business travel has been allowed from June 1, but overnight leisure stays are still forbidden to try to contain the spread of the virus. 
Kubayi-Ngubane said casinos would operate at 50% capacity, while cinemas and theatres would only be allowed 50 people or less. Restaurants, fast food outlets and coffee shops could offer sit-in services in addition to the take-aways they had already been allowed but would not be able to serve alcohol. 
Tourism Business Council of South Africa chief executive Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa said many restaurants might find it unprofitable to reopen without on on-site alcohol consumption. 
“At the end of it all it goes some way but we’re still far off and businesses are going to continue to bleed, retrenchments are coming in large volumes,” he said in an interview on news broadcaster eNCA.

The University of Michigan said on Friday its measure of consumer sentiment rose only 0.5 point among residents in the South in June. Southern states, including Texas, South Carolina and Florida, which had reopened by mid-May, are reporting a surge in cases of the respiratory illness. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday ordered bars to close down again and restaurants to scale back service. 
“While most consumers believe that economic conditions could hardly worsen from the recent shutdown of the national economy, prospective growth in the economy is more closely tied to progress against the coronavirus,” said Richard Curtin, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers chief economist. 
“The early reopening of the economy has undoubtedly restored jobs and incomes, but it has come at the probable cost of an uptick in the spread of the virus.” 
In the West, where coronavirus infections have also jumped despite early adoption of stringent measures to slow the spread of the disease, consumer sentiment increased 3.3 points in June. 
In contrast, sentiment among residents in the Northeast soared by a record 19.1 points this month. State and local governments in the Northeast are gradually reopening their economies while monitoring COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. 
Curtin attributed the surge in confidence to “residents apparently expecting the later and more gradual reopening to produce at worst a negligible increase in infections.” 
He predicted that the resurgence of the virus would undercut consumer demand in the southern and western regions and might even temper spending in the Northeast. 
The survey also found that consumers’ confidence in government economic policies dropped in June to its lowest since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.

The 69-year-old Panamanian former boxer retired in 2001 and is considered one of the best lightweights in history. He fought over five decades, held four different world titles, and his record stands at 103 wins, with 70 knockouts and 16 losses. 
Known for his aggressive punching power, Duran, who grew up in Panama City’s poor El Chorillo district and won his first title in 1972, is today regarded as a national hero. 
“The doctor tells us his lungs are fine and there are no signs of seriousness. Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well,” said Robin Duran. 
Panama has recorded 29,037 known coronavirus infections and 564 COVID-19 deaths.

The NWSL becomes the first major North American league to return after the coronavirus outbreak, with eight of the league’s nine teams traveling to suburban Salt Lake City, Utah, for the competition to be played without spectators. 
“It’s sort of like a beam of light,” Portland Thorns midfielder Rocky Rodriguez said in a team video. “It’s not only going to be a nice environment for the players in the sense that we’re going to be able to play and do what we love but also for the fans.” 
The Thorns lost in the 2019 semi-finals to the Chicago Red Stars, who were defeated by the Courage in the Cary, North Carolina final in October. 
The Courage boast a stacked midfield including championship MVP Debhina and U.S. women’s national team veterans Crystal Dunn and Sam Mewis. 
“We’ve got depth, we’ve got speed, we’ve got ability, we’ve got talent,” coach Paul Riley said. “They’re very mission-driven and I think this is obviously another challenge for them.” 
The Courage play the Thorns before facing the Washington Spirit, who fell just short of last year’s playoffs but boast a strong forward line with Rose Lavelle of the U.S. national team and Ashley Hatch, the squad’s leading scorer last season. 
“It’s different, it’s something I’ve never done before, but we can get games in - any way we can do that, I’m excited to,” Hatch, a graduate of Utah’s Brigham Young University, said in a team video. 
“Any time I get a chance to play in Utah, it’s like a home away from home.” 
The Chicago Red Stars, who lost last season’s championship game 4-0, have a strong defence that includes 2019 U.S. Soccer Player of the Year Julie Ertz and keeper Alyssa Naeher, who helped the U.S. win their record fourth World Cup title in France last year. 
The Orlando Pride were forced to back out of the tournament after players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19 before departing for Utah. 
Utah Royals forward Christen Press and Thorns midfielder Tobin Heath, both U.S. national team veterans, said they would not compete in the tournament over health and safety concerns. Ballon d’Or winner Megan Rapinoe of OL Reign also skips the event, though no reason was given.

The NBA was the first major North American league to suspend its season in mid-March after a player tested positive for the novel coronavirus. It recently agreed a plan with its players to restart with 22 teams at Disney World in Florida. 
But if the number of cases inside the NBA’s so-called “bubble” rises, “that may lead us to stopping” play, Silver told ESPN. 
Silver said the record number of cases in Florida recently has raised the level of concern but added that the use of the campus - where players will live, practise and play - is designed to limit risk of exposure to the surrounding community. 
Silver’s remarks came on the same day the NBA reported that 16 out of 302 players tested for COVID-19 on June 23 had tested positive. The league did not disclose the identities of the players.

More than 1,500 workers at the Guetersloh plant tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, while outbreaks have also hit meat and poultry plants in Britain in recent days. 
In many rural parts of the United States, meatpacking plants have been the main source of infection. On April 28, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep such factories open, warning of a potential threat to the U.S. food supply. 
The meat industry is particularly susceptible to coronavirus infections because of the nature of the work: intense physical labour, conducted indoors at close proximity to other workers. 
“Their work environments - processing lines and other areas in busy plants where they have close contact with coworkers and supervisors - may contribute substantially to their potential exposures,” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says of meatpacking workers. 
The CDC maintains a list of recommendations for factories, including steps to keep workers apart such as staggered arrival times and breaks, supplying workers with masks and hand sanitiser and making sure tools are disinfected. 
It says factories should take workers’ temperatures on arrival and send those with fevers home. 
Conditions on the factory floor itself are also not the only issue. Meatpacking workers often share transportation and housing once their shifts are over. 
In Germany, for example, many are migrants from poorer EU countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, often housed in large dormitories where the virus can spread. 
“Some of these factories have on-site or nearby accommodation where there are several people in each dormitory, they may be transported on a bus to the site of work, and they will be indoors together all day,” said Michael Head, an expert in global health at England’s University of Southampton. 
In the United States, by the end of May, the UFCW labour union estimated that at least 44 meatpacking workers had died of COVID-19, and that at least 30 meatpacking plants had to be temporarily shut down, impacting more than 45,000 workers and contributing to a 40% reduction in pork slaughtering capacity.

The pledging summit, part of a joint initiative by the EU executive and advocacy group Global Citizen, also included a globally televised and streamed fundraising concert featuring Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Shakira, Chloe X Halle, Usher and others. 
The Commission together with the European Investment Bank pledged 4.9 billion euros ($5.50 billion), the United States $545 million, Germany 383 million euros, Canada C$300 million ($219 million)and Qatar $10 million. Forty governments took part in the summit. 
The money will be used for COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines, and also to support the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities. 
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was crucial that everyone who needed it should have access to a vaccine. 
“I am trying to convince high-income countries to reserve vaccines not only for themselves but also for low- and middle income countries. This is a stress test for solidarity,” she said. 
British Premier Boris Johnson concurred. 
“If and when an effective vaccine is found, then we as world leaders have moral duty to ensure that it is truly available to all,” he said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron was adamant about pooling efforts together. 
“Let’s refuse an every man for himself approach, let’s continue to move forward together,” he said. 
Italy, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, echoed his sentiment. 
The EU is championing global cooperation in efforts to control and end the pandemic, in contrast to the United States and China’s focus on national initiatives.

Temperatures were expected to rise to over 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) on Sunday along the Salt River east of Phoenix. On Saturday, dozens of people climbed into inflatable inner tubes with coolers and took to the water to escape the heat. Very few wore masks. 
Texas shuttered tubing and rafting business on Friday and some beaches in Florida are closing again ahead of next weekend’s Fourth of July holiday to try to curb the rising outbreak in those states. 
The surge in COVID-19 cases has been most pronounced in a handful of Southern and Western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively, despite warnings by health officials to wait to see a steady decline in cases. 
For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases rose by more than 40,000, one of the largest surges in the world. In Arizona, cases have risen by 250% so far in June and have set record daily increases seven times. 
Even in states where cases have been declining for weeks, outbreaks are happening. One bar in East Lansing, Michigan has been linked to more than 76 cases, according to the Ingham County Health Department. That number is likely to rise, officials cautioned. 
Just a day after he sounded a note of optimism about the U.S. response to the pandemic and said the country was in “a much better place,” Vice President Mike Pence canceled events to campaign for Republican President Donald Trump’s re-election in Florida and Arizona due to the outbreak, campaign officials said on Saturday. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has criticized the administration’s response to the pandemic that has killed more than 125,000 Americans. She told ABC News on Sunday that mandating the use of masks across the country was long overdue. 
Global coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday according to a Reuters tally, marking a major milestone in the spread of the respiratory disease that has so far killed almost half a million people in seven months.

The study was conducted in China and published in Nature Medicine.
Specifically, the study's authors found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms may see their antibodies fade more quickly than those who tested positive for the virus and also came down with its tell-tale symptoms.
The study, though small and with limitations, provides greater insight into a topic that mystifies scientists examining this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Most people who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies, but the extent and duration of that protection remains unknown.
Researchers from Chongqing Medical University in China compared the immune responses of 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 to 37 symptomatic patients in the Wanzhou District of China. Forty percent became negative for antibodies early on in their recovery, compared to just 13% of people who developed symptoms.
The asymptomatic patients also reported lower levels of cytokines, or small proteins released by different cells in the body in response to infection. These proteins, when uncontrolled, can cause hyperinflammation.
The data suggests that asymptomatic people had a weaker immune response to the virus, echoing NIAID Director Anthony Fauci's concerns about varying antibody protection.
""It isn't a uniformly robust antibody response, which may be a reason why, when you look at the history of the common coronaviruses that cause the common cold, the reports in the literature are that the durability of immunity that's protective ranges from 3 to 6 months to almost always less than a year,"" Fauci said in an interview with JAMA Editor-in-Chief Howard Bauchner.
The study leaves just as many questions as answers. For example, scientists still don't know exactly what these dwindling antibody levels mean, and the lower levels don't necessarily imply that people who have already recovered from COVID-19 will be vulnerable to reinfection within a few months.
However, the study's authors said their results caution against ""immunity passports,"" or the idea that people who have recovered from infection should be granted some sort of special status to allow them to travel or return to work because they are theoretically totally immune from reinfection.
Past studies on SARS and MERS, two related coronaviruses that have led to prior outbreaks in people, have found that antibodies last for at least a year. In comparison, this study suggests that antibody levels for the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, may drop much more quickly.
""Given that antibodies are likely a component of COVID-19 protective immunity, this is important to confirm in larger studies,"" said Dr. Beth Kirkpatrick, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Vermont.
Antibodies are not the only immune response the body can generate. Although the immune components that protect against COVID-19 are still unknown, Kirkpatrick said that in some infections, people can still be protected even if antibodies are undetectably low. That's because their immune system, including the cells that produce antibodies or other parts of the immune system like T cells, carries a memory response that can be boosted rapidly.
Residents have their blood drawn for an antibody test for the coronavirus, also called a serology test, June 16, 2020, in Washington, DC.

Despite finding innate immunity in most COVID-19 patients, public health officials remain concerned about reinfection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection, according to the World Health Organization.
""I think that you're going to see as the immune response wanes in these respiratory infections, there is a possibility that you could get reinfected,"" said Dr. Robert Garry, professor at the Tulane University School of Medicine.
Garry cautioned, however, that it's too soon to know what level of immunity is protective. Scientists will know more as they get closer to developing a coronavirus vaccine, but for now, it would have to provide longer-lasting immunity than a natural infection, he said.
""That's hard to do,"" said Garry.
Kirkpatrick said companies may also consider booster vaccinations, administered more frequently than might have been expected with SARS or MERS.
The mystery surrounding immunity only reinforces the urgent need for a successful vaccine. Both experts agree that more data is needed to confirm the study's findings, but that the mere presence of antibodies may not be enough to immunize most of the population.
""Until there's a vaccine, things are not really going to be able to be relaxed to the point where people were doing the things that they were doing before,"" Garry said.
Dr. Alexis Carrington contributed to this report.

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.
 (CNN)It's the latest Disney experience: waivers of Covid-19 liability for one and all! The novel coronavirus ""is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death,"" Disney, while also reassuring that they have adopted ""enhanced health and safety measures"" now warns its potential customers: ""By visiting Walt Disney World Resort, you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure."" A phased reopening of the shopping and dining area at Disney World is scheduled to begin May 20 and continue May 27.
Disney will hardly be alone in issuing such a warning and advising customers that they assume the risk of entering. It's time to get used to seeing this kind of legal jargon frequently in your life, as businesses reopen across the country and try to find ways to shield themselves against potential lawsuits from patrons who might contract the novel coronavirus on their property.
Whether you knew it or not, this isn't all that new. As a consumer, you already waive -- or simply put, give away -- your legal rights all the time. If you've ever joined a gym, gone skiing or taken an indoor rock climbing class, you've almost certainly signed a waiver stating that you know the activity is dangerous and you won't sue if you get hurt. Those ""permission slips"" you sign for a child's little league team or a school field trip are often just another form of liability waiver. In today's litigious world, you'll find waivers are common not only for dangerous physical activity, but also for mundane activities -- especially for any likely to involve children.
Even if you don't physically sign anything, you sometimes agree to a waiver simply by your actions. If you have the ticket from the last time you went to a professional sporting event or a concert (or when you get yours the next time any of us is able to go to one), flip it over and read the fine print about what rights you surrender just by walking through the gate -- ""assumption of risk,"" in legal lingo. 
It might feel particularly jarring to sign a Covid-19 waiver before stepping through the front gate at Disney -- put your name here to give Mickey your right to sue! But this trend toward liability waivers for Covid-19 will become a common and reasonable strategy for businesses walking the narrow tightrope between re-opening to the public and protecting themselves against potential lawsuits. We are just at the beginning of what promises to be years' worth of litigation over this disease. Plaintiffs already have filed Covid-19-related personal injury lawsuits against businesses and governments across Europe, and a leading American legal publication warns businesses to ""prepare for personal injury litigation in the age of Covid-19.""
The law so far is untested, and will evolve. As people begin to file cases, and those cases move through the courts, look for key questions to arise: Do these waivers work? Can companies truly insulate themselves against lawsuits, and do people truly surrender their rights to sue when they sign a waiver? 
There is no one answer. Laws differ state by state and outcomes will vary according to the particular facts of the dispute. But certain general principles and key questions emerge. Most but not all states enforce waivers -- preventing a person from suing -- in at least some circumstances. States vary as to how much deference they give to waivers, and some courts strike down waivers deemed to be too lopsided against the consumer, or against the broader public interest. Courts sometimes -- but not always -- require that waivers be clearly written and understandable, and fairly bargained for between the parties. So when you see one of those tiny-print waivers chock full of legalese and wonder if it really would hold up in court -- the answer is it largely depends on what state you're in. 
Even where waivers are enforceable, they typically only go so far. They usually protect a company only for negligence -- meaning failure to use reasonable care -- but not for more serious conduct including gross negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. 
Of course, this raises another set of pivotal questions. What is ""reasonable care,"" and how will judges and juries apply that general legal concept to the real world as it is now shaped by this pandemic? How far do businesses have to go to protect against infection and spread? Is it enough to warn? How dire must the warning be? Is it sufficient to require masks, or to do nightly sanitization, or to conduct temperature checks? And if customers get sick, can they prove that they contracted the virus at or because of a particular business?
It is impossible to know the answers right now but, rest assured, the lawsuits will come, and the questions will be asked and Americans will demand they be answered. Expect businesses across the country to follow Disney's effort to insulate itself from potential Covid-19 liability. Such waivers are likely here to stay."

The company plans to grow Samsung Pay this summer by introducing a new “experience” that includes an “innovative” debit card supported by a cash management account. Details are only slated to arrive in the “coming weeks,” but it’ll have help from the financial startup SoFi.
It’s not a surprising move for Samsung. Apple has offered a credit card since 2019, while Huawei is following suit. Google is believed to be working on a debit card of its own. If Samsung doesn’t offer some kind of payment card, it might miss out if these cards turn out to be successful."

Franklin Foer, The Atlantic
If you thought the United States might’ve learned something from Russian meddling in the last presidential election, think again. The Atlantic details how some of the same vulnerabilities still exist, which means “the Russians could have strolled through the same door as they had in 2016.” What’s more, Foer explains how, with an election quickly approaching, one plan in motion is to “to identify democracy’s most glaring weakness by deploying college kids on their summer break.”"

Cado Security has determined that the attacks were conducted using compromised SSH (secure shell) logins from universities in Canada, China and Poland, using similar malware file names, the same vulnerability and shared technical indicators.

On Tuesday night, the total number of deaths in the US surpassed the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam War. As of Wednesday afternoon, 60,207 deaths have been recorded in the US.
While the spread of the coronavirus appears to be slowing in some regions, like New York, experts fear that there could be a resurgence if social distancing measures are relaxed.

In the physics community, arXiv says it will not mail its regularly scheduled announcement this evening, and submissions that would have been announced today will be announced on Wednesday.
“I want a day where I don’t have to worry that I’ve missed an important paper on the arXiv because I am stressed out while my non-Black colleagues happily keep going. The strike is not just about gathering people together to begin to take action, but it is also about a day of rest for the people most affected by this heated moment,” wrote Chandra Prescod-Weinstein, a University of New Hampshire physics professor and co-organizer of the strike.
The strike organizers note that the STEM community plays a role in society by conducting research that is turned into media releases, books and legislation, which can reinforce anti-Black narratives. STEM professionals also create technology, like facial and voice recognition, and several examples show racial bias in those technologies.
“As members of the global academic and STEM communities, we have an enormous ethical obligation to stop doing ‘business as usual,’” the organizers wrote.
There is one exception to the strike. The organizers say this is aimed at the broad research community, not those working directly on COVID-19 research. “If your daily activities are directly helping us end this global crisis, we send our sincerest gratitude. The rest of us, we need to get to work,” they wrote.
The strike is being promoted on social media with hashtags #ShutDownAcademia, #ShutDownSTEM and #Strike4BlackLives."

Formula E reportedly checked IP addresses and figured out that Abt couldn’t have been driving. Rather, 18-year-old pro gamer Lorenz Hoerzing, who competes in the parallel FE Challenge series, had taken his place. Hoerzing has now been banned from the Race Challenge series and stripped of his sixth place finish in the companion FE Challenge race.

It’s also designed to raise funds for UNICEF. Racers use the rFactor2 Simulation, with real-life Formula E and esports competitors often racing together. Formula E drivers must use a standardized sim setup and software, while esports drivers have a bit more leeway, equipment-wise.

The report, the largest of its type to date, also found that Black and Hispanic pregnant women may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. 
While the analysis comes with many caveats — namely, that it's unclear how many of the women were hospitalized due to labor and delivery, or pregnancy complications unrelated to COVID-19 — it provides important data on a group that scientists have known little about. 
It also underscores recommendations for pregnant women and their providers to take COVID-19 infections seriously, and for the healthcare system to address disturbing racial disparities. 
The report found almost a third of COVID-positive pregnant women were hospitalized 
For the study, researchers compared 8,207 COVID-positive pregnant teens and women to 83,205 of their infected peers who were not pregnant.
They found that more than 31% of the pregnant women were hospitalized, 1.5% were admitted to the ICU, and 0.5% needed to be put on ventilators. Of the non-pregnant women, 6% were hospitalized, 0.9% went to the ICU, and 0.3% were ventilated. 
Pregnant women with COVID-19 were not any more likely to die. 
The findings are reminiscent of a recent study out of Sweden showing that COVID-positive pregnant women were five times more likely to be admitted to the ICU and four times more like to be ventilated than non-pregnant women.
While the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has considered pregnant women an at-risk population for COVID-19 since they're susceptible to greater morbidity and mortality from other respiratory conditions like the flu, the CDC has maintained that the virus doesn't seem to ""affect pregnant people differently than others.""
This new data calls that conclusion into question. 
""I think the bottom line is this: These findings suggest that compared to nonpregnant women, pregnant women are more likely to have severe COVID,"" Dr. Denise Jamieson, head of the COVID-19 task force at ACOG, told the New York Times. 
While not addressed in the current study, it still seems that women can't pass the virus to their babies in utero or through breastmilk, and that most newborns who do test positive for COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms, and completely recover.

Pregnant women of color seemed to be especially susceptible to COVID-19
Among the pregnant women with COVID-19 who reported race/ethnicity, 46% were Hispanic, 22% were Black, and 23% were white.
Set against data from women who gave birth last year — 24% Hispanic, 15% Black, and 51% were white — the findings suggest women of color are disproportionately susceptible to COVID-19 during pregnancy. 
Earlier research out of the UK found more than half of pregnant women who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 were Black or from other minority ethnic groups. 
Other reports have shown that people of color, pregnant or not, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections and deaths due to systemic racism, and ACOG has long known that serious disparities in women's health care persist, with Black Americans three to four more times likely to die from childbirth or pregnancy complications than women.  
Marian Knight, the lead author of UK study, previously told Insider more qualitative research involving talking to women about their experiences is ""urgently needed"" to help understand what puts pregnant women of color at such risk for COVID-19, be it household arrangements or jobs that make physical distancing difficult, restricted access to healthcare, something else, or all of the above. 
The answers will likely differ between minority groups, making the questions even trickier to answer, Knight, a professor in the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, said. ""We have to accept that it's difficult, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be trying to tackle it."" 
The report comes with important caveats but pregnant women should still take the coronavirus seriously 
The current report has important limitations, most glaringly that it's unclear why the hospitalized women were admitted — for labor, delivery, or another pregnancy-related issue, or because their COVID was severe? 
Plus, clinicians are more liberal when it comes to admitting and providing care for pregnant women in general, so it would make sense that they'd experience higher rates of hospitalization than non-pregnant women. 
A lot of data was missing, too, forcing the researchers to make assumptions, for example that if a certain negative outcome wasn't reported, it didn't occur. 
The analysis also couldn't answer whether having COVID-19 is linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes, like pregnancy loss or preterm birth, although the CDC has maintained that it is, since that's the case with other respiratory illnesses. 
What the report does do, however, is provide needed data about a population researchers and doctors are still learning a lot about, and emphasize that women and their providers need to take the risk COVID-19 infection seriously. 
The study authors advise pregnant women to continue with their regular prenatal care appointments, limit interactions with others and take precautions when they do occur, and keep at least a 30-day supply of medicines. 
Because another recent study has shown pregnant women, whether or not they have COVID-19, are also at high risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic, it's also critically important for them to seek support, whether from friends and family, online support groups, a mental health provider, or all of the above. 
""There are going to be a lot of emotions, some of which are sadness, grief and the unknown,"" Dr. Jane van Dis, an OB-GYN who serves as medical director at the telemedicine network Maven, previously told Insider. ""Just know that connecting with people who are there to support women is essential for mental health.""

We originally thought of it as a virus that primarily attacked the lungs. After all, a cough and shortness of breath are some of the key signs of infection.
But the virus affects different people in different ways. Some may not have any symptoms at all, while others can be so sick that they need to be hospitalized. There's also mounting evidence to suggest that the elderly and children may have vastly different symptoms than the rest of the population.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, also reveals itself through skin problems, doctors are now learning.
The most well known is toes that look as if they're frostbitten, also known as ""COVID toes,"" but others are still coming to light.
The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) has been tracking the dermatological effects that COVID-19 patients are experiencing through a registry where healthcare providers can submit entries. The AAD has over 600 submissions so far from more than 25 countries.
""The pernio lesions or 'COVID toes' are certainly one of the primary things being reported"" in the registry, Dr. Esther Freeman, a dermatologist and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who's managing the AAD registry, told Business Insider. ""But we're also seeing a lot of other skin manifestations as well.""
Freeman said some of the other skin findings in the registry include morbilliform eruption, a non-specific viral rash that's a common skin sign of many viruses and drug reactions; urticaria, also known as hives; and vesicular eruptions, which Freeman describes as ""chickenpox-like"" blisters on the skin.
An example of ""COVID toes""

""Our knowledge is really continuing to evolve about the timing of these different skin manifestations because it's complicated,"" Freeman said. ""Not everyone seems to be developing them at the exact same time in the disease course. So I think we're still learning a lot."" 
Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.
Dr. Lindy Fox, a professor of dermatology at the University of California at San Francisco who is involved in the AAD's registry, told Business Insider that it's not surprising to see non-specific rash and hives, because they're fairly common bodily responses to viruses.
The skin symptoms that do stand out, Fox said, are COVID toes and vesicular eruptions (or blisters), because they're not as common in patients with other viruses. 
COVID toes are particularly unusual because they often appear after other COVID-19 symptoms have subsided and are more prevalent in patients with milder or no symptoms. 
Read more: 'COVID toes' might be the latest unusual sign that people are infected with the novel coronavirus
As for the vesicular eruptions, Fox said the dermatology community is still working to figure out why they're appearing in patients with the disease. There are only a handful of other conditions that cause similar blisters.
""COVID is now on that list,"" Fox said. ""So since that list is so short, it makes the likelihood of it being COVID in this day and age with COVID everywhere higher if you see that rash.""
Dr. Randy Jacobs, a dermatologist based in California, told Business Insider that he's been seeing something he calls transient livedo reticularis, red splotchy ""net-like"" skin discoloration, among some of his patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.
The interesting thing about this skin finding, Jacobs said, is how quickly it seems to appear and then disappear in his patients. The first patient who noticed the rash saw their condition clear up in 19 hours. Another saw it disappear in as little as three hours.
An example of ""transient livedo reticularis"" in a 67 year old patient who tested positive for COVID-19
Dr. Randy Jacobs
""It can come and last an hour and go away and people might not even see it,"" Jacobs said. ""They might not even notice it because it comes and it goes.""
From the outside, and even to experts, hives or rashes brought on by an allergy or by COVID-19 are impossible to tell apart. It's only after taking a test that would show the presence of the virus or of antibodies that someone can be sure whether or not they have or had the disease.
""I think it's important for people to understand that but just by looking at the skin, we are not going to be able to tell you if you're infectious,"" said Freeman. ""It might give you a clue of potential COVID, but to really understand if it is truly COVID, you would need a test.""
If someone is developing a new, unusual rash that they've never had before, they should contact a dermatologist or other healthcare provider to be evaluated, said Freeman. A doctor would be able to figure out whether there could be another cause for the skin changes and help get that person tested for the coronavirus.
Dr. Joanna Harp, director of the inpatient dermatology consult service at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, has been assessing skin findings in COVID-19 patients since the start of the pandemic. She told Business Insider in an email that there are a variety of rashes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
""The main finding we have noted is a pattern of lacy, red-purple rashes, some with skin necrosis, on the arms, legs, and buttocks in critically-ill COVID-19 patients,"" Harp said.
Doctors have seen through skin biopsies that the skin problems in more severe COVID-19 patients are brought on by clotting in the small blood vessels in the skin. Often, those patients also have blood clots in their legs or lungs, or have had strokes, indicating clotting problems throughout their bodies, Harp said.
There's evidence to suggest that such patients would benefit from blood thinners, but Harp says that decision is made on a case by case basis. 
Read more: Companies are scrambling to figure out how to get employees back to the office safely. One of Silicon Valley's favorite healthcare startups thinks it has the solution.
There are also other rashes like hives or bumps on the skin of some hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but Harp said it's unclear whether these manifestations are from the virus itself or from medications that patients are getting to treat the virus.
""I think the skin may be a window into how differently patients' immune systems can react when confronted with this virus,"" Harp said.
COVID toes, for example, are possibly indicative of ""a robust immunologic response to the virus,"" as most patients often have minimal symptoms, Harp said. Skin symptoms brought on by blood clots on the other hand, could show ""a heightened clotting tendency that really don't seem to be able to control the virus.""
""The skin may have a lot to teach us about this disease,"" she added.
At this point, it's unclear how common skin problems are for patients with COVID-19, because we don't know how many people are actually infected with the disease, in part due to limited testing.
—DermatologyACD (@DermatologyACD) May 6, 2020
Dr. David Francis, president of The Australasian College of Dermatologists, told Business Insider in an email that skin manifestations could be common in as many as 20% of COVID-19 patients. The figure comes from an early report by Dr. Sebastiano Recalcati of Alessandro Manzoni Hospital based in Lecco, Italy based on the patients he personally saw in his hospital.
Francis said that more research and collation of patient data is required in order to get a better understanding of the skin manifestations of the coronavirus.

Though the AAD's registry has collected hundreds of entries, Freeman said she's reluctant to make any definitive statements based on what she's seeing.
""Even if we see a certain proportion [of skin symptoms] in the registry, it doesn't mean that that's actually the proportion of skin filings that people are seeing,"" said Freeman. ""It's just what people are reporting to us or what people are finding notable that they are choosing to report, rather than truly a representative sample of an entire population.""

Across the globe we're settling into a new normal — an immediate acceleration of digital shopping — which has dramatically changed the way we live, work, and buy. It has impacted how we spend, send, and use money, with a tsunami-like ripple effect on many parts of the global economy. By mid-March, online shopping in the US had already surged 35% from 2019 levels1, driven by store closures, limited in-store inventory, and shelter-in-place orders.
While businesses of all sizes have been impacted, small businesses are in a particularly tough situation. Forced to find new ways to conduct business, less than half (46%) of US small businesses report having any online presence at all2. Even worse, 54% of small businesses in the US report they are closed or could close within the coming weeks in response to COVID-193. While these sellers may be small, they play a critical role in the lives of their customers, employees, and partners — and helping them has a broad ripple effects on their communities and economies.
Globally, Visa and our partners connect more than 61 million merchant locations. This puts us in a unique position to help businesses drive sales in this critical moment. Leveraging our network, our partners, and our products, we can help sellers get online easily to reach more customers; we can share data and insights to help businesses build their brands; and we can help buyers and sellers work together through uncertainty. 
While today's challenges may be new, Visa has been solving payment pain points for buyers and sellers for over 60 years. Collectively, our business and our brand are laser-focused on leading economic recovery efforts in the weeks and months ahead, helping businesses everywhere navigate through these common challenges with requisite urgency.
Here are six truths we're recognizing in this new normal and are using to help guide our product priorities to support sellers:
Consumers are shifting to digital-first commerce – no matter what they're buying.
Leading companies and brands are already powering cohesive omnichannel strategies that integrate mobile, online, and in-store commerce seamlessly. With in-store shopping severely limited across all categories of businesses, buyers are seeking out robust digital commerce experiences like never before. As millions of new buyers experience digital commerce for things like groceries, meals, and household staples, expect these newly formed habits to last.
Small businesses around the globe are seeking quick and immediate paths to recovery, as many navigate the overnight move to digital commerce.
Visa is uniquely positioned to help small businesses pivot and thrive as digital businesses, whether that means creating a new online presence or recognizing the changing ways consumer are spending online. In an effort to get more SMBs online faster, Visa and Shopify are partnering to provide all Visa card holders in Australia a three-month free subscription to the Shopify platform, helping to get them selling online quickly. Globally, our Fintech Fast Track program is helping small businesses that are innovating in the financial space get up and running fast and with dedicated Visa support.
Sellers, partners, employees, and customers need and expect secure, immediate access to funds digitally.
As one of the most trusted payments network in the world, Visa delivers fast and secure money movement options that address pain points today. Through Visa Direct, companies can pay employees or gig workers quickly by moving money to their Visa debit cards in real time4 — which is more critical now than ever. We are also helping our clients make it easier for people when sending and receiving money to others – whether you're a small business owner who needs funds for business or someone who needs to send or receive money from friends or family, both domestically and around the globe.
Contactless payment experiences are a necessity – avoiding contact while buying is better for health and safety.
Visa is a world leader in contactless transacting, and we're working with our partners to ensure that our capabilities are made widely available and updated specifically to help meet today's challenges. For the transactions that still need to be made in person, we have doubled down on our contactless efforts around the world, including raising spending limits to enable a larger number of PIN-free purchases in approximately 40 countries.
Businesses need the right data and insights to drive their decisions.
Visa provides access to data and analytics that help our clients and partners understand the impact and effectiveness of the critical decisions they are making today. We are helping online sellers deal with an influx of activity by assessing purchase risks for them, drawing on data from billions of worldwide transactions. Putting our network to work, we're providing consumers with a way to support local businesses with our Back to Business locator tool, which identifies businesses that have recently processed a Visa transaction and we believe may be open for business.
Buyers and sellers are seeking transparency and protections.
As this crisis has unfolded, many plans changed quickly, events were canceled, and destinations were closed or became inaccessible. This has brought about a significant increase in disputes between buyers and sellers. To help resolve these disputes as quickly and effectively as possible, Visa launched a COVID-19 Dispute Monitoring Program on April 1, 2020. Through Verifi, we also offer services that can help prevent disputes and resolve disputes before they become chargebacks. For clients and sellers not already using Verifi, we've made sure that our implementation is turnkey and can happen in a matter of hours or days, depending on the service and merchant. 
Visa is committed to helping businesses implement complete solutions that protect both consumers and sellers in an increasingly digital-first world. Our team is working around the clock and around the globe to deliver products and services that can help businesses find new paths to survive and thrive in today's remote world.

Instead they are awake, talkingnot struggling to breathe. 
Although nobody is quite sure what about the coronavirus causes these patients to react this way, they are rapidly changing how many doctors are treating the disease. Instead of rushing to put such patients on mechanical ventilators for fear of them suddenly getting worse and dying, some doctors are now holding off on the invasive treatment, believing that many of these patients will do just fine without them. 
Bing COVID-19 tracker: Latest numbers by country and state 
Pre-Covid, doctors looking to boost a patients blood-oxygen levels would often turn first to less invasive methods of support such as CPAP or BiPAP machines that push air into a patients airway through a face mask, or high-flow nasal cannulasprongs that blow heated, humidified oxygen into a patients nostrils. If that didnt work, physicians would use mechanical ventilators.  
Get news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox
But people with Covid-19 began showing up at the hospital with rarely seen, ultra-low blood-oxygen levels. Even for those who werent struggling to breathe, doctors were concerned that patients conditions could suddenly worsen, which with Covid-19 could swiftly turn deadly. So they often intubated sooner.  
In the past, youd see these kinds of oxygen levels, and your brain would intuit all these other things, said Scott Weingart, chief of emergency critical care in the department of emergency medicine at Stony Brook Hospital in Stony Brook, N.Y. For instance, youd assume the patients lungs must be so bad that if we dont intubate now, they might crap out.
Doctors have dubbed these patients happy hypoxemics, a reference to the paradox of abnormally low levels of oxygen found in their blood combined with an ability to breathe relatively easily. In recent weeks, doctors at Stony Brook Hospital have used ventilators less on these patients, turning instead to the CPAP or BiPAP machines or high-flow nasal cannulas. 
Dr. Weingart remembers one of his first such patients in Marcha 42-year-old man with blood-oxygen levels so low he should have been unconscious. Instead, he was sitting up, smiling and talking. He was breathing quickly, but seemed fine otherwise. Dr. Weingart and his team used a high-flow nasal cannula to boost the patients oxygen levels. They also turned him on his front, a method known as prone positioning that doctors have found can also help boost oxygen levels partly by reducing the pressure of the heart and diaphragm on the lungs. The patient was never put on a ventilator and was discharged in a week, Dr. Weingart said.
Several other doctors said they are having success with such simpler approaches. That, in turn, is reducing demand for ventilatorsa critical concern early in the crisisand easing strain on hospital staff, they say.
Abdul Khan, medical director for Ochsner Medical Centers West Bank intensive care unit in Gretna, La., has also encountered these so-called happy hypoxemic Covid-19 patients.
Weve learned that they are able to tolerate these lower levels of oxygen for a significant period of time, he said. Dr. Khan and his colleagues now use ventilators as a last resort for such patients.
Mechanical ventilators help people breathe when they cant on their own. A tube is inserted through the nose or mouth into their trachea. The tube is connected to the ventilator, which pushes a mix of air and oxygen into patients lungs. The ventilator can also apply a constant amount of low pressure that helps keep air sacs in the lung from collapsing.
Ventilators play an important part in care, but there are serious risks to being on one for too long. Patients can get secondary infections like bacterial pneumonia. They can get urinary tract infections from being bed-bound and are at higher risk of kidney failure and getting blood clots. If the ventilator isnt set properly, patients can sustain lung injury.
Recently published data also suggest ventilators may not be as effective at keeping seriously ill Covid-19 patients alive as they are with other patients with severe respiratory problems.
In the U.K., 58.8% of Covid patients on invasive breathing support had died as of May 7, according to data from the countrys National Health Service. That compares with a 34.5% death rate among patients with other types of viral pneumonia who receive invasive breathing support, according to historic data. Of the Covid patients placed on basic breathing support, 17.8% died.
In New York, 88% of 320 Covid patients placed on mechanical ventilation in the states Northwell Health System died, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Of the 2,314 who didnt receive mechanical ventilation, 11.7% died.
Experts note that the studies may at least partly reflect that Covid patients who start ventilation tend to be the sickest, and therefore the least likely to survive.
At University College Hospital, a large teaching hospital in central London, doctors are placing patients on less-invasive breathing support, and only progressing them to ventilators if they are still struggling. Under that system, around half of patients are managing with simpler breathing support.
Its worked out well for us, said Mervyn Singer, an intensive care consultant who said UCH adopted this approach on the advice of doctors in China and Italy. Weve been able to retain our capacity to ventilate because we havent immediately put lots of people on ventilators.
At the outset of the pandemic, doctors rushed to put Covid-19 patients on ventilators in part due to concerns that less invasive methodswhere the air patients breathe in and out isnt contained in tubesposed a greater infection risk to health-care workers.
Benjamin Medoff, chief of the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said his hospital continues to recommend against the routine use of these less invasive methods because the devices can potentially push virus particles into the air and CPAP and BiPAP masks can leak. (Dr. Khan of Ochsner West Bank and Dr. Weingart of Stony Brook said their hospitals place filters on these masks, and use specially ventilated rooms to keep their staff safe.)
In a study recently published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Dr. Medoff and other researchers at MGH and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said 50 of the 66 patients on mechanical ventilators between March 11 and March 30 at those hospitals were discharged from the ICU, while 11 of the patients died.
We dont have to think too much outside of the box here, Dr. Medoff said.

Osmosis, a popular online medical education site founded by two former Johns Hopkins medical school students, is offering a free online course on COVID-19, led by its Chief Medical Officer, on Coursera. 
""COVID-19: What You Need to Know"" is available for free. It's regularly updated with the most current information issued by the CDC, WHO, and other leading agencies and covers topics like personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and more. Healthcare professionals can earn CME credit for taking it. 
The course is led by Rishi Desai, MD, MPH, a pediatric infectious disease physician with a public health background, and Mary Ales, the executive director of Interstate Postgraduate Medical Association (IPMA) for the last 17 years.
As part of the class, students will learn to recognize the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, as well as how it spread around the world and how to apply the public health measures needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Although probably better suited to healthcare professionals, the average person can take the course to understand how to help mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce the burden on our healthcare system.
The course breaks down into five videos (about 45 minutes total), 13 readings, and seven quizzes. It should only take students three hours to complete. Subtitles are available in English, Italian, and Spanish."

Global benchmark Brent crude settled down 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $40.71 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 42 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $37.96 a barrel.
More:
US crude inventories rose to a record high last week for a second straight week, reaching more than 539 million barrels. Conversely, distillate stockpiles fell following weeks of significant builds, government data showed.
The coronavirus continues to spread in parts of the US, while flights were cancelled and schools were shut in Beijing to head off a new virus outbreak in the Chinese capital.
""Today's slide seems to be related to the build we saw in crude stockpiles and ongoing worries about demand due to the coronavirus,"" said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ""The market is trying to find whether it has enough strength to resume its rally that took us above three-month highs.""
US fuel demand, as measured by product supplied, is down 20 percent over the past four weeks from a year earlier, the government said.
US crude production fell by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week to 10.5 million bpd, its lowest since March 2018. Some of that was due to Storm Cristobal, which shut more than one-third of US offshore output.
However, US shale producers are expected to restore roughly half a million bpd of crude output by the end of June, according to crude buyers and analysts, amounting to a quarter of what they shut since the coronavirus pandemic cut fuel demand and hammered oil prices.
Such a swift rise in the US production would complicate efforts by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia to encourage global allies to fulfil their pledges to make record production cuts.
They, along with allies in a group known as OPEC+, agreed to big cuts in April to balance oil supply to prop up prices, and anticipated similar economic cuts by the likes of the US as well.
US producers cut supply by roughly 2 million bpd but larger producers are reopening the taps in Texas, as well as in expensive shale basins in North Dakota and Oklahoma.
Fracking activity tracker Primary Vision estimates as much as 500,000 bpd of production will return to the market by month-end, while Rystad Energy estimates 400,000 bpd could be added to the market between June and August.
""Some of the bigger guys that we work with are starting to turn everything back on,"" said Joshua Wade, an oil marketer in Oklahoma, who works with producers to transport barrels and buys lease volumes.
Producers are also pumping oil out of storage, which filled when demand plummeted as billions of people worldwide stopped travelling due to lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Much of the declines in output came from shale wells that were choked back but not shut-in completely, several shale company executives said.
""We were able to shut in thousands of wells with really minimal time and effort. And we can bring those back on with really minimal time and effort, too,"" EOG Resources Inc Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Helms said at a Tuesday industry conference.
Diamondback Energy Inc focused on curtailing volumes rather than fully shutting wells, Adam Lawlis, vice president of investor relations, said in a statement.
About 8,000 bpd of the 10,000 bpd of oil that shale producer Devon curtailed came from choking back wells or slightly delaying wells.
""We're in the process of bringing all of that back on,"" Hager said.
But the increase in production may not last, analysts said. North American oil companies have slashed spending by 35 percent, and US rig counts have dropped to a record low. Since shale well output declined by more than 60 percent after the first year, the reduced spend on drilling will weigh on shale production over the long term, sources at shale companies said.
""Oil going to $40 for a fleeting moment isn't going to be enough for some of our stronger operators to say, 'OK, I'm going to just turn the turn the tap on.' They need to see it be sustainable,"" Nicholas O'Grady, CEO of Northern Oil and Gas, said."

She initially attributed her symptoms to a common cold.
Business Insider España
Out of the 4.3 million people around the world who have been infected with COVID-19, some 1.5 million have recovered.
Despite this recovery rate, many people still don't know what it's like to have the coronavirus, and how to deal with early symptoms.
Five people who recovered from the disease have told Business Insider what the virus feels like, the symptoms you need to be aware of, and what they wish they had known before contracting it.
How to catch initial symptoms
In March, María Galán, Sandra Majada, Dionisio Juanas, Ignacio Montes, and Cristina Nieto — who live across Spain — all began to notice symptoms of the coronavirus in themselves.
Having paid close attention to the news, many of them recognized the symptoms as being associated with the illness.
María woke up one day a little cold, with sneezing, mucus, headache, and a very slight fever.
At first, it seemed like her symptoms were those from a common cold or flu. But as they worsened and wouldn't go away, she realized it was much more serious.
""I was very tired. I had headaches and a fever that wouldn't subside,"" María said. ""After a few days, I assumed I'd gotten over the cold symptoms.""
""I realized I was infected when I was cleaning with bleach and realized that I couldn't smell a thing.""
Sandra Majada.
Business Insider España
Experts have advised that people suffering from coronavirus symptoms and those who have tested positive completely isolate themselves in a room in their home.
But it's harder than it sounds.
""Just a week before I started to feel ill, my boyfriend — with whom I was isolating — came down with a high fever of up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit for seven to eight days and a lot of headaches, "" said María.
""It coincided with the start of working from home, schools closing, and the declaration a state of emergency.""
Both had to manage the situation while cohabiting a 55-square-meter apartment in the center of Madrid.
Neither of them was able to purchase masks or gloves and, though they tried their best to keep at a safe distance, infection was almost inevitable.
Ignacio Montes had to go to the emergency room on his own when he felt worse.
Business Insider España
Not everyone gets the same symptoms
Ignacio waited a few days for his symptoms to get worse before seeking medical help.
At first, he followed the medical advice to stay home and keep an eye on his breathing. After some time, though, he realized he really wasn't well. Doctors asked him to return for closer examination.
He was sent home after that but saw no improvement the next day.
Eventually, he had to see a private doctor, who prescribed him treatment, including the Azithromycin antibiotic and bronchodilators, which help relax the airways and help people breathe.
""The emergency rooms were empty. I was quickly attended to and given a lung scan,"" he said.
""The doctor told me that, thankfully, my lungs were fine at the moment and that what I was experiencing was the acute bronchitis associated with COVID-19.""
Dionisio Juanas says medical treatment was non-existent and he had next to no follow-up care.
Business Insider España
Different health systems give different levels of care
Dionisio suffered from the illness alongside his family.
When they started getting symptoms, they contacted their local clinic for advice because people had been asked not to go to hospitals on their own.
""Care has been nonexistent,"" Dionisio said, adding that the only advice he was given was to ""control the fever.""
He said he and his family called the health services twice but received the same response.
Meanwhile, Cristina said her experience with her local health system was positive. She went once to see her local doctor, and once to the hospital emergency room.
There, they performed a chest scan which indicated she was positive for COVID-19.
""They saw I had a mild case of pneumonia so they sent me home with specific medication for the virus and called me regularly from April 6 until recently,"" she says.
""On Sunday, April 12, they told me I had been discharged from La Paz,"" referring to Hospital La Paz, in Madrid, where she visited.
After that, her local doctor was tasked with monitoring her condition and continued to call her to check in.
Cristina Nieto was missing a lot of information while she was suffering with the coronavirus.
Business Insider España
What they wish they had known
All five told Business Insider they wish they had a complete list of COVID-19 symptoms when they were starting to get their own.
They said such a list had been slow to surface, making it hard for them to understand what they were going through.
Only in late March did health agencies start discussing the loss of taste and smell, and muscle pain, as a symptom — and by then, many had already experienced it. 
Cristina feels that she lacked enough information to manage her situation properly.
Advice for people going through COVID-19
Sandra wants to reassure people who notice that their symptoms not going away after a period of time.
""Although the symptoms last a long time, the best thing to do is to stay as calm as you can and to be very patient,"" she said.
All stress that staying calm is key, as the number of patients who recover from the coronavirus is high.
They also recommend that, if you are suffering from the illness, try not to obsess over the information circulating on social networks and WhatsApp.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
Apple today reported its second quarter earnings, which showed resilient growth for the company despite the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on its supply chain and retail business. Apple posted revenue of $58.3 billion good for a 1 percent increase over this time last year and earnings per share of $2.55. Analysts had expected revenue of $53.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.23, according to Bloomberg. 
Despite COVID-19s unprecedented global impact, were proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter, driven by an all-time record in services and a quarterly record for wearables, CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. In this difficult environment, our users are depending on Apple products in renewed ways to stay connected, informed, creative, and productive. 
In February, Apple warned investors that it wouldnt meet its Q2 earnings guidance due to constrained iPhone supply around the globe and decreased demand for its products in China during the height of the outbreak there. Hardware sales were down across the board in Q2 with the exception of wearables, the division that Cook highlighted. Apple is not providing any Q3 guidance. 
With most hardware sales down, the company had to be hoping that its services business (which includes Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and more) would be a bright spot this quarter since so many people are spending the bulk of their time at home. And that proved true, with services hitting an all-time record. 
Apples retail stores in the United States and elsewhere with the exception of mainland China and one in South Korea; theyve already reopened have been closed since mid-March as health officials continue imploring people to follow social distancing guidelines and reduce density where possible. 
The pandemic has not prevented Apple from releasing new products. In recent weeks, weve seen a new MacBook Air, iPad Pro (with its Magic Keyboard), and the $399 second-generation iPhone SE make their way to consumers. And the company has said it will hold an online-only version of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where you can expect to see the next major features coming to iPhone, iPad, Macs, the Apple Watch, Apple TV, and more. 
Apple has joined together with Google to create a joint system between Android and iOS that will be utilized for contact tracing in hopes that it can help slow the spread of the virus as some regions begin to lift their stay-at-home orders and restore a sense of normalcy. Developers making apps for health organizations will be able to start using the system in May, with deeper contact tracing set to arrive in iOS and Android as part of upcoming software updates. 
Rumors have suggested Apple is facing coronavirus-related manufacturing delays for this years iPhone lineup; the companys first 5G devices might ship later than their usual timeframe after theyre announced this fall."

Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge
Facebook is partially lifting its advertising ban on face masks and will now allow third-party businesses to advertise cloth masks and other non-medical face coverings like bandanas, the company announced on Wednesday. 
The company first instituted a site-wide ban on ads for all forms of face masks, including medical and respiratory masks, in March due to national shortages and concern for medical staff and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban was also designed to protect against scams, misleading marketing, and other abuses, as Facebook could not reasonably vet every ad promoting face masks that began flooding online marketplaces in early March. 
As the spread of the novel coronavirus began accelerating throughout the US earlier this year, a surge in demand for cleaning products, face masks, and other household goods created a unique predicament for online ad markets and e-commerce companies. Merchants have been found price gouging, making false health claims, and failing to deliver purchased goods, leading Amazon, Facebook, Google, and other companies to institute a number of bans and other measures to cut down on exploitative behavior. 
Facebook says you can advertise cloth face masks, but not medical ones
In April, the US Centers for Disease Control adjusted its face mask guidance people are now advised to wear masks outdoors and in places where social distancing is difficult, like grocery stores. As a result, Facebook is lifting the ban to make it easier for people to find and purchase cloth masks. The ban remains in effect for medical and respiratory masks like the 3M-made N95 mask. Just yesterday, 3M sued an Amazon Marketplace seller for selling fake N95 masks at inflated prices, illustrating the ongoing issues plaguing medical face mask sales, which are now being tightly controlled by Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Many health authorities now advise wearing non-medical masks and in some places masks are required for activities like taking public transportation or visiting a store and weve seen people and businesses of all sizes working to fill this need, Facebooks Rob Leathern, its director of product management, wrote in a blog post. 
Facebook is still imposing some restrictions. It says companies or independent merchants will need to have accumulated at least a four-month history of advertising on Facebook to be approved to market masks. Its also restricting sellers in countries where we have seen high percentages of policy-violating ads promoting medical supplies during the temporary ban to selling only non-medical masks within the country the seller is located, Leathern explains. 
The company is also maintaining its ban on any ads that make medical claims or any product marketed with health or COVID-19-related wording. Primarily, that means the products that can be advertised will be handmade cloth masks and other forms of face coverings made out of fabrics or reusable material.

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge
With theme parks and movie theaters closed and major sports events canceled, there were few parts of Comcasts business that didnt feel the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. And company executives said on Thursday that they dont expect to see a whole lot of improvement for the second quarter. 
Comcast posted revenue of $26.6 billion for the first quarter, a 0.9 percent decline year over year, and net income of $2.1 billion, a 40 percent drop from the year-ago quarter.
Basically, there was less for viewers to watch, and that meant less programming for Comcast to run ads against. The Q1 results reflect audience ratings declines and reduced advertiser spending resulting from the postponement of sports events due to COVID-19, partially offset by higher pricing, Comcast said in a statement. 
The companys NBCUniversal segment struggled the most during the first quarter, with a 7 percent revenue decline to $7.7 billion. Comcast said last week that many of the shows it had planned for its new Peacock streaming service wouldnt be ready until next year. (Disclosure: Comcast and NBCUniversal are investors in Vox Media, parent company of The Verge.) 
Revenue for its filmed entertainment division was down 22 percent, and theme park revenue was down 32 percent, as all of its Universal theme parks were closed in March due to the pandemic. Comcast CFO Michael Cavanagh said on Thursday that the company does not know when the parks will reopen and added that it was pausing construction on its fourth gate, Epic Universe, at Universal Studios Orlando.
Comcasts ad revenue for the quarter was down 2.2 percent. COVID-19 began to impact cable advertising at the end of the first quarter, and we expect advertising to be down significantly in the second quarter, Cavanagh said during the earnings call.
Many large companies that posted first quarter earnings this week reported lower advertising revenues due to the pandemic, although perhaps not all are feeling it as acutely as Comcast at least, not yet. Alphabet parent Google said on Tuesday that it experienced a significant slowdown in ad revenues last month, but its revenue was up 13 percent. Facebook also said it saw ad revenues slow but still saw profit up 102 percent from the year-ago quarter. And Twitter, which reported first quarter earnings today, had a huge spike in users but said its ad revenues fell apart in March.
Comcasts Sky division, the UK broadcaster Comcast acquired in 2018, saw revenue decline 5.8 percent in the quarter, and it lost 65,000 Sky customers due to sporting events being postponed and some channels being suspended. The company said it has been allowing Sky customers to pause sports-related subscription payments to mitigate the risk of customer disconnect.
Comcasts cable revenue rose in the first few months of the year, but it lost 409,000 cable TV customers as people continue to move toward streaming options.
Even though Comcast lost cable TV customers in Q1, it added 477,000 internet customers, which the company said on an earnings call was its best quarterly number in more than a decade. Wireless revenue was up 52 percent.
On the earnings call, the company said a residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the market increase, and the video subscriber loss in the quarter.
But Comcast is expecting more headwinds in the second quarter as the pandemic keeps many businesses closed and people at home. 
Our Cable Communications results, while strong in the first quarter 2020, will be negatively affected in the second quarter by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions in recent weeks and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as the population increasingly works and learns remotely from home."

Gov. David Ige declared a state of emergency, giving him the authority  to suspend any law that impedes emergency functions. By the 16th, the outbreak had arrived: The state had 10 confirmed cases, and Ige began to act on that declaration.
Among the statutes he suspended was Chapter 92F of something called the uniform information practices act. It was easy for a layperson to miss, but the change effectively blocked requests for public records in the state for the duration of the emergency.
Hawaii is among several jurisdictions around the country that have amended or suspended access to public records as the coronavirus spreads. Governors are taking emergency action in some states, ordering changes to public records compliance during the crisis. Other states and municipalities have made legislative changes to their laws. But government-transparency advocates argue that in a time of crisis, access to public records is even more important.
Officials say they need to take drastic actions to battle the pandemic. In New Jersey, where the state legislature amended its open records law, an analyst with an association of state municipalities told NJ.com that officials need the flexibility during emergencies to be able to run government and respond to the emergency at hand. A San Diego county spokesperson told the Voice of San Diego recently that the public interest in receiving records at this time is outweighed by public interest in having county personnel free to handle this ongoing emergency.
State and local jurisdictions arent the only ones making changes. At the federal level, government agencies are making their own decisions about how to process requests. But its clear those requests are facing heavy delays. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) recently found that several agencies were telling requesters to expect delays through the course of the crisis.
On March 27, a report from the Congressional Research Service explained some of the reasons for those delays. The report noted that in some cases employees working remotely wouldnt be able to find documents that werent already digitized. The report found that some agencies said they would expedite critical information during the crisis, but some said other requesters would be left waiting.
Theres little precedent for such sweeping changes, even in times of crisis. A month after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Attorney General John Ashcroft released a memo reminding federal agencies of their ability to block access to agency deliberations under the Freedom of Information Act. The memo said agencies should take full and deliberate consideration of the institutional, commercial, and personal privacy interests that could be implicated by disclosure of the information. But the memo was only guidance.
At the state level, after Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey offered government agencies guidance on dealing with public records requests during an emergency, but the guidance clearly stated that the right to access government records is not suspended during a disaster.
After some California agencies said they would stop responding to public records requests because of COVID-19, transparency advocates including the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement that there was no legal basis for such an extraordinary step.
The coronavirus pandemic is not Californias first major crisis, a coalition of organizations wrote in the statement, and the Legislature has never authorized the suspension of the California Public Records Act.
The Markup has seen similar results of government reaction to the pandemic at the state level. Weve filed records requests with all 50 states, New York City, and Washington, D.C., for their coronavirus testing algorithms. While many states have already complied with the request, and we have data on 24 jurisdictions so far, weve also seen delaysincluding some that may be indefinite.
In Hawaii, our request to the state health department was denied. After two weeks, officials returned a largely blank form with a bold, underscored line stating, Pursuant to Governor David Iges Supplementary Proclamation, dated March 16, 2020, response to your public records request will be postponed indefinitely.
Washington, D.C., which has added COVID-19 office closure as an exception to the requirement to respond to public records requests within 15 days, acknowledged our request but said it would be delayedthree times. Emails from the citys health department said the deadline for fulfilling our request would be moved from March to April, and then to May 15, and then to June 8, as the emergency was extended. The city ultimately provided some information on its policies at the end of April instead.
Pennsylvania responded to our request about a month after it was filed. An official acknowledged receipt of our request but said the health departments public records office was closed for the duration of the emergency. Requests will be processed upon resumption of business, the official wrote in an email.
Unlike actions from governors, which put an end date on the emergency changes, New Jersey has amended its public records law directly to suspend the time required for a response during an emergency, effectively making the change permanent. Previously, officials faced a hard deadline of a week for responding to requests. Now, the state law says that, for the course of a declared emergency, the custodian of a government record shall make a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for access to a government record within seven business days or as soon as possible thereafter.
This is of course terribly concerning because theyve taken their public records law and practically turned it into a mere suggestion, said Gunita Singh, a legal fellow for RCFP.
COVID-19 is no excuse to relax the fundamentals of open government and transparency, Singh said.

This approach sacrifices safety for speed, which can lead to low quality work reaching a wide audience. It also means that there are way too many papers on COVID-19 for humans to read.
These issues led researchers from Northwestern University to create a tool that predicts which studies are most worthy of further investment as well as the research thats unlikely to work.
The Northwestern system uses an algorithm to predict which studies will produce results that are replicable meaning they have the same effect when tested again on a new group of people.
Existing methods of assessing replicability rely on review by scientific experts, a thorough but time-consuming process.
For example, the Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (SCORE) process created by military research agency DARPA tasks around 314 days on average. Thats a long time to wait when youre trying to tackle a global pandemic.
Professor Brian Uzzi, who led the Northwestern study, believes this process has two major problems.
First, it takes take too long to move on to the second phase of testing and second, when experts are spending their time reviewing other peoples work, it means they are not in the lab conducting their own research.
Uzzis team trained their model on statistics and text from over 2 million study abstracts, and then gave it a new set of studies to evaluate.
Their idea was to analyze not only data, but also the narrative that study authors use to explain their results. It does by recognizing patterns in words that reveal a researchers confidence in their findings which human reviewers dont always detect.
They then compared the predictions to DARPAs SCORE evaluation. The researchers say their system produced equally accurate results but in a matter of minutes, rather than months.
Ultimately, the team aims to pair the system with expert reviewers which they say will be more accurate than either a human or machine working alone.

It can be used in hospitals, though not to replace traditional ventilators.
The Flow is designed around standard resuscitator bags used by paramedics, and is designed to be simple to use, according to Fitbit. It has a clear window on the side so healthcare workers can observe the bag pumping, and additional sensors for monitoring patients and control over the volume and pressure of the oxygen. It was granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization earlier this week. According to The Verge, the Flow would cost around $5,000. For reference, ventilators cost anywhere from $25,000 to $50,000 when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo attempted to purchase them in March.
Its worth noting that the Flow isnt a conventional ventilator, nor is it designed to replace one. According to FDA documents, the Flow is intended to be used only when an FDA-cleared clinical ventilator is not available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even Fitbit admits that the point of the Flow is to act as a stopgap to help make up for a lack of said FDA-cleared ventilators, with Senior Staff Research Scientist Dr. Tony Faranesh saying:
We know from some conversations that physicians are already trying to work out the ethics in deciding who gets the ventilator and who doesnt, due to shortage of supply. The goal here is to support life in the event that ones not available until one might become available.
Fitbit isnt the only company trying to help the situation by designing a ventilator. NASA and Dyson both swiftly developed their own ventilators, with the NASA prototype being given the same clearance the Flow now has back in April. Its worth noting as well that the Emergency Use Authorization of this device doesnt mean it could be used in conventional hospitals after the pandemic abates itd need further FDA testing and approval for that.
Theres some question about whether healthcare workers still need emergency ventilators as much as they did when the pandemic began, not to mention how much of a market is left for the Fitbit model now NASAs model has been out over a month. Then again, the fear is that a second wave of patients is forthcoming, in which case the Fitbit Flow will definitely see more use. Besides, having it out there as an option cant possibly hurt.

Avaamos Project COVID uses a deep learning system called natural language processing to turn our questions about the pandemic into website and database queries. It works a lot like Google or Bing, you input text and the AI tries to find the most relevant information possible. The big difference is that Avaamo carefully guards the gates against misinformation by only surfacing results from reputable websites such as CDC, NIH, WHO, and Johns Hopkins.
Best of all, theres no cost for businesses to use the tool. Per a press release from Avaamo:
Project COVID is also available free of cost to be embedded on the website of care management providers, health care organizations, businesses, or government agencies, which are facing a mounting number of questions, support calls and community requests for information on the COVID-19 outbreak and responses to it. The utility is free, and is designed to quickly and easily embed into any existing website in just a few minutes.
Quick take: This is really cool. The information is valid, the companys recently updated the system, and it doesnt appear that any business that wishes to implement Project COVID on their own sites will have to jump through hoops to get it installed.
Having a simple, non-medical (Avaamo is careful to point out that this is not a substitute for professional medical advice) solution to providing solid information to common COVID-19 questions is a big deal. Weve moved past static FAQs because the pandemic is an ever-changing situation. This represents a great way to keep clients, patients, and customers up-to-date without having to reinvent the wheel to do it.

How is that possible?
As we seem to be reaching the light at the end of the COVID-19 quarantine tunnel, many of us question what this might mean for mobility, and particularly, for public transport.
The lockdown has generally had the same impact all around the world: car journeys fell 5080% and public transport ridership plummeted by even more, while cycling and walking had a relative increase.
Asian cities awakening from their own winter sleep suggest that the western public will also continue to avoid using public transport, instead of opting to bike or walk. What is worrying is that car use in Asia is also up understandable as people attempt to avoid contact with one another. However, its impact on air pollution should be a warning to all cities, given that the spread and the fatality rate of COVID-19 have been proven to correlate with air pollution levels.
[Read: How mobility startups can help authorities fix public transport after the pandemic]
Lets draw up the three scenarios where European cities could be headed:
1. Carmageddon
Everyone jumps into a car. To ease congestion we build motorways across cities and severely reduce or ban walking and cycling to avoid pedestrian deaths. Issues with this scenario: infrastructure and healthcare are expensive and governments do not have money to construct these inner-city motorways, or to tackle the health issues related to sedentary lifestyle or respiratory disease like COVID-19. Hopefully, this scenario is a no-go.
2. Cycle-paradise
Cities increase the temporary cycling infrastructure network, eventually making it permanent. They create entire networks of car-free zones so that people feel safe to walk and cycle in urban areas. Instead of commissioning bus companies, municipalities contract long-term bike-hire companies to rent bikes and e-bikes to the public, like Paris Veligo or the Dutch Swapfiets. With prices ranging from 40 to 75 for monthly rentals, it makes using an electric bike much more attractive. In addition, handicapped and elderly populations will also have access to special bikes, such as the fall-proof bikes from Gazelle. Should the weather not be particularly kind to us, as the Dutch and Finnish populations often experience, we can opt to stay and work from home (or put on a poncho?).
But how likely is it that public transport companies will go down without a political fight, especially when they might be owned by the government or the municipality in which they operate? What would be the political and social implications of letting these go?
3. Bike-transit
I do see a third, more rosy scenario for public transport, which is based on Bus Rapid Transit systems and can be referred to as BRT-lite (lite as it would be repurposing existing lanes and not building new infrastructure).
If you are reading this and live in a city or region that was well-served by public transport before the lock-down, then you have probably come to expect decent bus service that is close to where you live and that does not leave you waiting for long periods of time. The bus might drop you off at a local transport hub, from where you might take the metro to the center or other parts of town.
Cyclists in Amsterdam
Today, however, with social distancing required within the bus and a lack of resources to double or triple the number of busses to achieve such low ridership per vehicle, we need a novel solution. What we can do is look at Bus Rapid Transit operations, or buses, that take the main corridor only and stop at just a few bigger hubs.
In an extreme case, a city could re-allocate all its services to run in this manner, covering the same area with fewer routes. Of course, this would require passengers to walk 1520 minutes or, given that cycling is becoming a more accepted mode, they could cycle 510 minutes.
Passengers are willing to walk longer distances to higher-level transit, such as rail or metro, due to the fact that they are compensated with a faster or farther-reaching service. Budapest is made up of 1.7 million inhabitants within its city limits, and almost 3 million inhabitants within the entire agglomeration. It also boasts fairly good transit services with an extensive bus and tram network, four underground lines, and four suburban rail lines (I will disregard other rail services now). Using Remixs Transit Platform I made a quick comparison of three different options:
Budapest Transit
A. Current conditions
5 minutes walk 303 lines, 1.660 vehicles
Current accessibility levels, while maintaining 303 lines and 1660 vehicles,  1.7 million people can reach the city center (Jane, after Jane Jacobs) within 60 minutes if they are able to access a stop via foot within 5 minutes 350 meters.
B. BRT lines
15 min walk 22 lines, 338 vehicles (every 5 minutes)
Operating only 5 BRTs, keeping underground and suburban railways as is and using only a quarter of the vehicles by running every 5 minutes, will allow almost the same amount of people (1.5 million) to access the city center within 60 minutes provided that they walk 15 minutes to/from the stop
C. BRT + all rail-line services
15 min walk 57 lines, 626 vehicles (every 5 minutes)
In this scenario I kept all the 24 tram routes in addition to the previous setup, reaching almost as many residents as in current conditions. Its still not perfect, passengers still need to walk 15 minutes or cycle 5 minutes to reach a stop, but with only a third of the vehicles, access to anywhere in the city is being provided to almost the same number of people as in the first scenario. In addition, this also means that the rest of the nearly 1000 vehicles left could be deployed to ensure social distancing-measures in the case that the five-minute running frequency does not suffice.
Going Dutch
I am not suggesting that cities should implement this third scenario starting tomorrow, but I would like to highlight the potential of a public transit system if your passengers do some of the leg-work (sorry for the pun). There is ample evidence that bike-transit is a more desired mode than the private motor vehicle. Research from the Netherlands suggests that cyclists enjoy the same access and speed getting to their final destination within a city as they would if they took a private car. This might explain why half of the rail passengers arrive at the stations by bike and a quarter left with a bike.
This Dutch bike-transit operation is a marvel in transport engineering and has grown its modal share 5% annually in the last 10 years. Much of the credit goes to the OV-fiets, the public transport bike rental scheme, available now at over 300 train stops. Passengers are allowed to return bicycles to the same station within 24 hours, providing them the peace of mind in knowing they can return in the very same way, wherever they go.
Reinforcing cycle, more cycling more high-level transit use more need for local cycling, Kager et Harms, 2018.
The 15-Minute dream
We can also see that the Bike-transit scenario overlaps with Scenario 2, the Cycling Paradise. Its no wonder the BRT-lite scenario complements this cycling paradise option, as both mutually exclude the car-dependent scenario. Due to the fact that most citizens are willing to cycle up to 5km, they remove the need for local low-level transport (e.g. feeding service) while reinforcing the high-level transit systems that depend on the feed. When the public can access (and leave) stations by bike as comfortably as by walking, you multiply catchment areas to those stops.
Once inhabitants start experiencing the positive reinforcement of such a BRT system, the need for cars will vanish in urban areas. Shops start popping up around focal points (eg. near the stations) and car-free streets make living conditions more pleasant, encouraging urban sprawl to transform into a clustered network of dense villages.
Isnt this what the 15-Minute City is all about?

The model was trained on data from more than 2.5 million users of the COVID Symptom Study app developed at Kings College London, which anyone can download to report their daily health status. 
Around a third of the users had logged symptoms associated with COVID-19. Some 18,374 reported having had a test for coronavirus, 7,178 of whom had tested positive.
The researchers then investigated which symptoms were most likely to be associated with a positive test and made some striking discoveries.
[Read: AI model predicts the coronavirus pandemic will end in December]
Their findings suggest that focusing on fever and cough is dangerously insufficient. In fact, their most common predictor of COVID-19 was the loss of taste and smell known as anosmia. Two-thirds of users with positive tests reported this symptom, compared to just a fifth of those who had tested negative.
The researchers used all this data to create a mathematical model that diagnoses whether someone likely has COVID-19 based on their age, sex, and a combination of four symptoms: anosmia, severe or persistent cough, fatigue, and skipping meals.
They found that the AIs predictions were accurate nearly 80% of the time. Of over 800,000 app users who said they were unwell, just under a fifth were predicted to have the disease.
Professor Tim Spector from Kings College London said the results showed that anosmia should be included in routine screening for COVID-19:
We strongly urge governments and health authorities everywhere to make this information more widely known, and advise anyone experiencing sudden loss of smell or taste to assume that they are infected and follow local self-isolation guidelines.
The researchers believe combining their AI system with mass adoption of the COVID Symptom Study app will show where tracking and testing are needed most.
Even if the tools accuracy leaves a lot to be desired, it could help overcome the shortages in coronavirus testing.

For the latest updates follow Cities Today on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube, or sign up for Cities Today News.
The coronavirus pandemic has forced mobility leaders to do the previously unthinkable and discourage their citizens from using mass transit. The next step re-opening transport networks looks set to be harder still.
This issue was highlighted during two recent Cities Today Institute roundtables attended by city and transport leaders from Europe and North America.
As Laura Shoaf, Managing Director, Transport for West Midlands, put it: For somebody who runs a public transport authority and has spent my entire life working in [this field] to push out communications asking people not to take public transport has pained me beyond belief.
Transport officials face the same mobility system complexity they always have now with the added complication of COVID-19 and social distancing, which could reduce capacity to 20 percent or even less. There are huge implications for operator revenues, the local economy, citizens quality of life, trust between residents and the city administration, and much more.
Urban areas dont work without mass transit, and mass transit and social distancing are incompatible so theres a real conundrum here, said one roundtable attendee.
Public transport usage plummeted up to 90 percent in some cities around the world during coronavirus lockdowns. Now, as cities begin to tentatively open back up, officials have stressed that their infrastructure cannot cope if even a fraction of journeys that would have previously been taken by mass transit shift to private cars.
March data from Ipsos suggested that the pandemic was causing a modal shift in China, with 66 per cent preferring to drive in the wake of coronavirus, compared to 24 percent before. Public transport dropped from being the preferred option for 56 percent to just 24 percent. A further Ipsos update confirmed that some consumers in the US and China are now more likely to buy a car because they believe driving offers better protection from COVID-19 than other forms of transport.
Battle for public space
Active travel on a scale like never before is a major focus to combat these effects, with many cities closing streets, widening pavements and throwing up temporary or permanent bike lanes. Optimism is high about boosting these modes, which has long been a goal. Roundtable delegates sounded a note of realism, though, highlighting that in some areas, a significant proportion of residents dont have bikes, and that a lot of journeys are not walkable. Several cities also report considering or fast-tracking e-scooter pilots to give citizens an additional option.
As cities make way for increased food and retail deliveries, bikes, walking, queuing outside shops, social-distanced public transport and realistically cars, they face a whole lot of competition for very little space in the public realm.
Stephen Zoegall, Global Lead Cities &amp; Infrastructure, Accenture, who moderated one of the roundtables, said the next steps rely on a systems thinking mindset, which means considering interdependencies from inception to delivery and beyond.
Being quick and prudent will require incremental rather than radical changes, he commented. For example, the gentle re-allocation of vehicle road space to active travel, initially allowing for co-existence (e.g. car-free Sundays) with a gradual move towards car-free streets, will allow for smoother adoption rates and cultural changes.
One official suggested that predictions that residents will stay away from public transport may not be borne out or at least to the extent that many assume. With the citys transport network now running at around 25 percent of normal levels, services are already full, they said. Further, feedback from citizens suggests that expanding services is a priority for them.
This backdrop makes the stakes for what happens next very high. One roundtable delegate said: If we get it wrong and the first pictures everybody sees are people too close together on a bus or people cramming onto a train, youre going to lose the confidence straightaway of anybody coming back to public transport, so its a very delicate balance.
Strategies discussed for the way ahead included running more services, continuation of working from home as well as staggered school hours. Technology can play a role too, from passenger-counting tools and apps that allow citizens to see how busy services are in advance, to contactless payments and demand-responsive services.
Zoegall noted that fostering trust in public transport intersects with a number of urban policy areas, such as health, education, business and services, culture, society, environment, city planning, etc. Decision-makers should consider the use of public transport from the unique vantage point of each domain when developing policy and messaging, he said, adding that: Where possible, government should be transparent and accessible in the language they use to communicate decisions, directions and strategies. There should be a weekly build to this messaging, as a way to build momentum each week. This seems obvious but it is an art to distil complicated policy into a simple message.
On trust, delegates agreed it is more constructive to encourage or mandate that citizens wear masks in enclosed public places, rather than singling out public transport to avoid the suggestion that the latter is disproportionately risky.
Revenue
While several cities said investment in public transport is now more important than ever, revenue and financial viability hang in the balance for many, squeezing already-tight budgets. The idea that urban transport is now no longer a commercial option is a very real possibility, one delegate said.
This, as well as the possible need to persuade some people back to public transport when the time is right and it is deemed safe to do so, led some to question whether the pandemic could see more public transportation services being made free permanently some cities have toyed with this idea in the past or are trialling it, and several have actioned it during the crisis to reduce physical contact.
Throughout the emergency, public transport has been a lifeline for essential workers and this highlights the importance of transit as an essential service and maybe less of a business model, said one delegate.
However, fares make up a significant portion of the revenue for transport operators and how they would plug that gap from a standing start remains unclear. The idea of emerging partnerships could offer one possible opportunity.
Winston Churchill once reportedly said: Never let a good crisis go to waste and this quote resonated with leaders during the discussion as they highlighted some positives which could emerge from the pandemic, notwithstanding the human tragedy and economic toll.
Dave Steele, Executive Director, Regional Transit Leadership Council, a coalition of public and private sector leaders from throughout the South-eastern Wisconsin region, said: The upshot of this is [considering] how we can use this unique moment in history to innovate. We always talk about transit being essential now, we have an opportunity to see in real-time where those routes are that are so essential that even if you restrict ridership people are still using that service. Then we have to add additional assets to those routes to ensure that people can use them.
And Michael Replogle, Deputy Commissioner for Policy, New York City Department of Transportation, commented: This is a transformational moment. We wont bring New York City back the way it was. We will need to maximize mass transit, minimize the use of cars and think about this in terms of fighting global warming, pollution and congestion, while boosting equitable access.

The software uses Bluetooth to alert people if theyve been in contact with someone who has the virus. When a user declares that theyve likely caught COVID-19, the system sends a notification to other Android phones and iPhones that have been in their vicinity.
The idea is to both reduce infections and help governments monitor the viruses spread. However, it will only be effective if a lot of people use it, a problem that has plagued most existing contact-tracing apps.
Apple and Google claim that their tech is privacy-preserving. Users can decide whether to opt-in for Exposure Notifications and report their diagnosis. In addition, the system doesnt use GPS location data tracking, unlike many of the contact-tracing apps being rolled out by governments.
In a statement, the unlikely partners said:
User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.
The companies have also stressed that the software is designed to augment rather than replace existing contact tracing efforts. Public health authorities will decide how the notifications are pushed on phones.

We need politicians to be able to make informed decisions, and we need to support the development of effective vaccines and treatments, as well as understanding the unfolding impact of the pandemic on society. The speed with which the global scientific community has risen to this sudden pressing need is remarkable.
But science is usually a slow-moving process a series of steps towards a better understanding, rather than individual eureka moments. Getting to the truth is often not straightforward, and scrutinising claims and counter-claims is an inherent part of the scientific method. Individual studies need to be replicated to see if the original observations are robust, and often they turn out not to be.
But now we are seeing necessarily and understandably a rush of studies attempting to add to our modest knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and provide answers to all of the other important questions emerging from the pandemic.
Read: [Small errors in coronavirus testing might lead to surprisingly big problems]
Some of these studies are conducted with limited resources, rather than specific funding for the purpose, although funders such as the Wellcome Trust and the UK Medical Research Council have moved fast to provide significant support for research activity in this area.
The rise of the preprint
Scientific publishing is also changing.
Usually, scientific research is peer-reviewed before it is accepted for publication in a journal. This means that (typically) two or three researchers with relevant expertise have reviewed and critiqued the work, and often recommended revisions or even further experiments. It is meant to ensure that published work meets a certain minimum quality standard, although it is certainly by no means perfect. Even though it is the established means of ensuring quality, weak work can slip through, and strong work can be unfairly criticized and delayed.
Now, we are increasingly seeing more results posted to preprint servers for more rapid dissemination. A preprint is effectively the version of a scientific article that has not yet been peer-reviewed. It is usually posted around the same time it is submitted to a journal for review.
Preprint servers have been around for a long time in some disciplines notably mathematics and physics, where arXiv has been in use since 1991 and have existed in other guises, for example as working papers in areas such as economics. But they have only become widespread in recent years; there are now multiple platforms supporting preprints across a range of different disciplines, including biomedicine, for example, bioRxiv and medRxiv.
Often the published version of a study the one that has passed peer review is a little different from the preprint version. But sometimes changes are required, and often important ones, such as the inclusion of additional experiments or analyses that provide greater confidence in the overall conclusions of the work.
One of the advantages of preprints over traditional forms of peer review is that they allow more scrutiny from a far larger portion of the scientific community than is provided by the traditional peer-review process. The danger comes when a preliminary report is interpreted as definitive.
The fact that preprints should be treated as preliminary is well known by researchers. However, in the current situation, we are increasingly seeing results reported in preprints being picked up by the media. For example, a study of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies conducted in Santa Clara, California was reported by a number of outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, despite having been heavily criticized by some researchers.
Preprints allow researchers to get their results out quicker, but they should be treated with caution. Credits: Shutterstock
This in itself is not entirely new, but we are seeing rapid growth in preprints as scientists attempt to put their findings in the public domain as quickly as possible at the beginning of April 2020, around 17% of COVID-19 publications were preprints. This is coupled with a desire for equally rapid dissemination of apparently noteworthy new findings by the media. The overall sense is that the scientific process has been accelerated.
But is this entirely a good thing? There is a long-standing aphorism originally from engineering but perhaps applicable here fast, cheap, good; you can pick two. We all know from personal experience that when we rush mistakes are more likely to happen. This is simply human nature, and scientists, however well trained and well-intentioned, are human too. The fundamentals of good design, careful conduct, and thoughtful interpretation apply even when there is a pressing need for knowledge.
These different issues research conducted quickly and disseminated via preprints rapidly, and the media reporting these findings equally rapidly perhaps conspire to mean we are at risk of generating and communicating findings that are not robust. And we have already begun to see retractions of COVID-19 research.
Transparency is everything
Work that is still at the preprint stage should be clearly reported as such by media outlets, and readers should treat the findings as preliminary. Perhaps more importantly, we all need to recognize that our knowledge will evolve, and no single study or finding will be definitive. Understanding COVID-19 is a team effort.
The current pandemic is unprecedented in recent history and has demonstrated the strength of the global scientific community. Resources have been rapidly diverted towards understanding the virus, modeling strategies to reduce its impact, developing vaccines and treatments, and more. Collaborations both national and international have emerged almost overnight, and preprint servers have experienced a surge of submissions. We are making progress and at an extraordinary pace.
However, we also need to ensure that our desire for speed in the generation of knowledge is not at the expense of quality. Given the importance and the immediacy of the challenge we face, rigorous and high-quality research is more important than ever. Transparency will be critical. By making study protocols, materials, data, and analysis plans available to researchers, work will be able to be scrutinized more closely, and any errors detected and corrected more rapidly. Indeed, the mere act of making our research transparent may encourage more error-checking before we release our work.
There is an urgent need for data and knowledge, but it is critically important that research is of high quality and that the knowledge generated is robust. False information is worse than no information at all.

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book ""Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos."" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)In prepared testimony for his appearance before the US House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health on Thursday, Rick Bright said he was removed as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority because he was raising the alarm about the coronavirus early this year and also resisting pressure from the Trump administration to promote an ""unproven drug, hydroxychloroquine, to the American people without transparent information on the potential health risks."" 
Leaving aside the question of why exactly Bright was removed from his post at BARDA, he has certainly proven to be right about the antimalarial drug that President Donald Trump consistently promoted as a ""game changer"" and that also was touted by Fox News hosts and close Trump allies such as Rudy Giuliani. 
On Monday, a study of more than 1,400 COVID-19 patients in New York was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the largest such examination to date, which found that hydroxychloroquine gave no benefits to COVID-19 patients and instead significantly increased their risk of cardiac arrest. 
Monday's JAMA study followed a New England Journal of Medicine study that was published last week that concluded hydroxychloroquine neither helped nor harmed 1,376 patients who were admitted to New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center between March 7 to April 8. 
As a result of these studies, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert said, ""The nail has virtually been put in the coffin of hydroxychloroquine."" 
In the advance version of his testimony for Thursday, Bright also made some dire predictions about what may lie ahead for the United States, testifying that, ""If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities ...Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history."" 
That's a very gloomy prediction as it seems to suggest that more Americans could die of Covid-19 than the 675,000 who died during the 1918 flu pandemic.
Is Bright right? Maybe. A leading infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota estimates that there could be as many as 800,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States over the next 18 months. 
There are many reasons for believing that such a large death toll is a strong possibility, including the likelihood that the US will experience a ""second wave"" of Covid later in the year. 
Testing for the coronavirus in the US is also still far from where it should be. So far there have been almost 10 million tests conducted in the States, but that's only for around 3% of the population. 
A study from Harvard co-authored by New America CEO, my colleague Anne-Marie Slaughter, suggests we need 20 million tests a day by mid-summer to really safely open up the United States and re-mobilize the American economy. 
Meanwhile, the US has an anemic contact tracing effort unlike South Korea, which has had only 260 deaths. 
The US has a population more than six times larger than South Korea so, adjusted for population size, if the United States had a plan in place like South Korea's we might have on the order of around 1,700 Covid-19 deaths. Instead, the US has had over 84,000 deaths, the most in the world. 
Also, most American states that are now opening up are not adhering to federal guidelines about when that is sensible to do. 
And, so far, there is no effective treatment for Covid-19 except for remdesivir, which shortened recovery times by four days for seriously ill patients in a clinical trial compared to those who received a placebo, but the drug is in short supply. 
Meanwhile, accurate antibody tests are still a ways off and developing a widely available vaccine could take years. 
Bright is making some dire predictions, but in his prepared testimony he says he was right when he warned earlier this year that the coronavirus was likely to be a big problem and unless we have a coherent national response he may be right again about the winter of discontent that we may enter at the end of this year."

COVID
I know this feels like a petty complaint. It is! And, to be fair, Twitter did add a tab for following COVID-19 news inside of trending topics, which I guess is nice for folks not tied to the news like yours truly. 
Trending was never great to begin with. It's never really given you a good picture of what's going on online that day. You couldn't even call it a snapshot. It's like staring through the backend of keyhole: it's a fuzzy, distorted image of what's happening. 
The trending section is easily flooded by things no one actually cares about internet flotsam or only tells one or two words of an important story. Every story is pretty damn important these days. Trending topics isn't helping."

Now, 16 of them have tested positive for COVID-19, reports the local news station News4Jax. Seven employees at the bar tested positive, too.
Doctors, virologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, nurses, and public health experts have emphasized incessantly that spending time in crowds particularly inside and without masks is a recipe for allowing the coronavirus to easily spread and blossom in a human population that has no immunity to this new pathogenic parasite.
Still, some Americans continue to ignore advice from experts who have spent decades researching infectious diseases. This is immensely problematic because the coronavirus isnt magically going away, even if some politicians hope it might. There is no vaccine or treatment for this relatively new disease, and there likely wont be, until at the very best, sometime in 2021. COVID-19 is substantially more deadly than the flu
, and can severely sicken young people, too.
I think we were careless and we went out into a public place when we should not have, Erika Crisp, a 40-year-old healthcare worker who tested positive for COVID-19, told News4Jax. And we were not wearing masks. I think we had a whole 'Out of sight, out of mind' mentality. The state opens back up and said everybody was fine, so we took advantage of that, Crisp said.
(Since reopening, coronavirus cases in Florida are starkly rising.)
Yes, it's a bummer that we cant live the same lives we lived five months ago. Most live, in-person concerts, for example, largely wont happen for at least a year. But this is the worst pandemic to occur in a century. Spending time in crowded indoor settings, drunk, and not wearing masks will inevitably result in more disease, particularly in states where infections are still smoldering. Think about how many respiratory droplets fly around bars. Sometimes, most everyone in your group will get infected and then bring that infection home. (Of course, bars aren't the only place where the coronavirus will spread: packed churches and private gatherings are repeated culprits, too).
This is a virus that we know is very happy to take advantage of people being careless, Dr. Vince Silenzio, an M.D. and professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told Mashable in May. 
If political leaders want to run experiments, that doesn't mean you have to be one of the guinea pigs, Silenzio added.
The Jacksonville healthcare worker, Crisp, partook in the states experiment and got some unsurprising results. But Crisp can now impart some knowledge to those on the fence about listening to pandemic experts: We should be wearing masks. We should be social distancing, Crisp told told News4Jax. It was too soon to open everything back up.

Here are some vital things to remember about the coronavirus pandemic going forward, perhaps for at least the next year:
The new coronavirus will be circulating in our communities for quite a while. To curb the spread, its up to us to make either informed decisions, or, unfortunately, decisions based on hope and ignorance (Crisp's group chose the latter). News4Jax reports that Lynch's Irish Pub, after temporarily closing following its prominent role in spreading disease, will be opening again next Tuesday."

Your medicine cabinet is your first go-to in times of illness, and sometimes it gets a little bare. But we're in the midst of a global health crisis. And whether you get Covid-19 or not, it's important to be prepared.
We know, we know. Some of these may be a little obvious, but go ahead and actually check your supplies now. 
Let this be your friendly reminder toconfirm you do, in fact,have the basics. If not, add these to your shopping list. Like now.
Here's a list of what you can use to make sure your household's medicine chest is well-stocked for the length of the pandemic.
Do you think you have Covid-19? A fully stocked medicine cabinet can help you make an initial assessment.
""There are certain signs and symptoms that tip people off to whether they have Covid-19,"" said Dr. Gary LeRoy, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and an associate professor of family medicine at Wright State Universityin Dayton, Ohio.
Thermometer: Early on in the pandemic, pharmacy shelves had been emptiedin people's rush to buy thermometers and monitor possible fever symptoms.
A fever is a hallmark symptom of Covid-19, especially one reaching 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or more, according to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
But also know how to use the thermometer right: Timing is everything. Check your temperature first, before you takeyour pain or fever reducer. ""These medicines artificially lower your temperature,"" LeRoy said. Once you know how bad your fever is, then take your medicine.
Doctors recommend using rectal thermometers for infants. For children and adults, a thermometer under the tongue works just fine.
More advanced no-contact infrared thermometers also have their virtues, especially by eliminating the need to physically touch a symptomatic person.
""Infrared thermometers are easy to use, but they are more expensive,"" LeRoy said.
Cough drops and cough syrup: These stalwarts of the home health arsenal are a good initial line of defense to help reduce the coughing symptoms that are a key indicatorof Covid-19.
Acetaminophen: It helps reduce the muscle ache pains associated with Covid-19 and other viruses, as well as fevers (again, check your or your child's temperature first before administering this pain and fever reliever).
Ibuprofen: This anti-inflammatory is also great for reducing pain and fevers. Use with caution, though, if you have gastrointestinal issues such as acid reflux, LeRoy said.
Antidiarrheals: Diarrhea is a symptom of Covid-19, and if it happens, make sure to hydrate aggressively, as it causes you to lose fluids.
For all of these medications, make sure to read the labels carefully to ensure youtake the right dosage.
The new additions everyone should have
Face masks or coverings: By now you should have a mask or a bandanna or scarf set aside to protect yourself when you're out and about. Keep your stock in your medicine cabinetand in handy places around the house, and also keep one in your car so you don't get caught out in public without one.
""You should also have extra masks for visitors to your house who don't have one,"" LeRoy said.
Make sure you've got a supply of face masks for your whole family. You might not be doing much flying this summer, but you can still keep in minda familiar line from flight attendants: Put on your mask before assisting others.We mean this literally.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes: Read the labels and try to focus on products thatcontain a base of 60% ormore of alcohol.
Latex gloves: You don't have to wear gloves if you're wiping down counters at home, but if you do, make sure you remove them properly.After you're done using them while cleaning or grocery shopping, remove them by sliding your finger in underneath their opening so you don't touch the exposed outer side with your bare hands.
Pulse oximeter (optional): Pulse oximeters are devices that measure the saturation ofoxygen in the body's red blood cells.Early on in the pandemic, the devices were selling out everywhere. Doctor's offices use medical-grade pulse oximeters when monitoring patients with specific conditions, such as emphysema.
At home, experts say the average person doesn't necessarily need a fancy device to measure blood oxygen levels. If shortness of breath is an issue, call your doctor.
""If the question is, 'Would it be a good early indicator if somebody has Covid-19 infection?', I would say probably not,"" said Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Washington in an interview in April.
And a recent study by scientists at the University of Oxford showed that many smartphone apps purporting to measure blood oxygen saturation were unreliable.
""It is not physically possible to measure SpO2 (oxygen saturation levels) using current smartphone technology,"" the authors concluded.
More general items are still key in the pandemic
You ought to be keeping a supply of general health itemsat home, too.
Some of the symptoms of Covid-19 mirror those of other conditions, particularly allergies.
Prescriptions: The CDC reports that the average American takes at least one prescription medication. The agency recommends keeping a seven- to 10-day supply, and storing them in childproof containers.
Antihistamines: Spring and summer mark allergy season, so if your symptoms feel a little better when you're not outside, youcould be suffering fromallergies. Ifthese antihistamines aren't clearing up coughing or congestion, that could be a sign that something else is causing your symptoms.
""If it's not getting better, don't just keep treating it,"" LeRoy said. ""Talk to your doctor.""
Decongestant: Congestion is a key feature of colds or the flu, and a decongestant is acornerstone of any medicine cabinet. A stuffy nose ison the list of symptoms of Covid-19, too, although it's not the most commonone. A report from the World Health Organization that analyzed the first 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China noted that 5% of cases included nasal congestion.
Calamine lotion: It's a great standby if you're spending more time outdoors this summer and get exposed to poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac.
Adhesive bandages: They're just as good now as when Johnson &amp; Johnson employee Earle Dickson invented Band-Aid strips in 1921 to help treat his wife's minor cuts in the kitchen. Any form of adhesive bandage or gauze pads will do.
Fine-tippped tweezers: Thesecan help address a number of issues, notably in removing ticks. If you're outdoors this summer and notice a tick on a friend or your own skin, you can follow the CDC's guidelines, grasping the tick close the skin, and then pulling it off with steady, gentle pressure.
Check expiration dates and dispose of medicine properly
Use the pandemic as motivation for an overall inventory check. As you're updating your stockpile, it's a greattimeto get rid of medications or other products past their use-by date. Besides avoiding a stomach ache or other complications, you'll be able to make room for new remedies.
You need to dispose of old prescription drugs carefully. The USEnvironmental Protection Agency strongly discourages people from flushing prescription or over-the-counter drugs down the toilet or drain and into the waterways unless the product's label specifically says it's OK.
Unused or expired prescription drugs can best be safely discarded by handing them off at a drug take-back site, location or program, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
To find a drop-off locationin the United Sates, Google Maps offers a mobile-friendly way, directing you where to go. You can also type in your ZIP code through a Drug Enforcement Administration website to pull up a list of locationsthat will gladly take your leftover medicines.
Your home medicine cabinet is your first stop for routine scrapes or runny-nose symptoms. But it'sno substitute for sound medical advice.
The contents of your medicine cabinet are a ""tool, not a replacement for medical intervention or a conversation with your physician,"" LeRoy said.
During the pandemic, a large number of hospitals and doctor's offices are focusing on telehealth visits to help alleviate the need for in-person visits.
Pay close attention to how you're feeling. ""Chart what those symptoms are and then treat those symptoms,"" LeRoy said.
But before any of this gets out of hand, fulfill this homework assignment for us.

At times, the hospitals were overwhelmed with patients, many of whom died. It was a deadly month for the state.
As the coronavirus pandemic spread, infecting millions globally and killing hundreds of thousands, doctors have been forced to rapidly figure out how to treat it without a vaccine or medicines that cure it. They're still not sure of the best way to get oxygen into the damaged lungs of the most severely ill patients, for example. 
Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn approach to caring for patients with the disease, from treating blood clots to using ventilators, evolved, Dr. Patrick Borgen, the hospital's chief of surgery, told Business Insider. 
In particular, the emergence of blood clots as a severe complication related to COVID-19 has changed the way the hospital treats all COVID-19 patients from the minute they're hospitalized, Borgen said.
About a month ago, the complication wasn't even on the hospital's radar. 
""We began to understand just how much blood clotting was a part of the COVID story,"" Borgen said.

Clots can wreak havoc on the body, traveling and blocking up veins, leading to strokes, heart attacks, kidney problems, lung problems, and more. They're common in hospitalized patients, but appear to be happening more frequently in COVID-19 patients severely ill with the disease. 
To counter that, Borgen said the hospital now keeps an even closer eye on them, using anticoagulation treatments to keep patients' blood from clotting throughout their hospital stay. The hospital is also discharging patients on blood-thinning medication, he said.
Hospitals around the country now are beginning to address clotting as a concern related to COVID-19.
Clotting complications appear to pop up in about 10% of all hospitalized COVID-19 cases, according to data seen by Dr. Mark Crowther, the chair of the department of medicine at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada and the treasurer of the American Society of Hematology.  
""There's absolutely no question that physicians really need to have blood clots on their radar screen,"" Crowther said. ""If you fail to consider it, you can get into trouble pretty quickly."" 
COVID-19's impact goes beyond the lungs
Dr. Ed Kuffner, an emergency-medicine physician by training, volunteered in the emergency room of NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island during the pandemic.
Kuffner, who's now the chief medical officer at Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer companies, said caring for COVID-19 patients showed him that the disease did more than just impact a person's lungs.  
""I had in my head it was primarily if not exclusively a pulmonary disease,"" Kuffner said.

Over time, he realized that wasn't the case. Yes, a lot of the severe complications have to do with the lungs, but he saw it affecting all organs. For instance, over time he started putting patients on full anticoagulation doses when they came into the emergency room, rather than the lower preventive doses, Kuffner said. 
""I started to realize that what I went in thinking really wasn't the true extent of COVID-19,"" Kuffner.
In the case of COVID-19, where the risk of clotting appears to be higher than in a typical hospitalization, Crowther said he expects to see more hospitals prescribing preventive doses of blood thinners to more patients as they leave the hospital than they might otherwise. 
Crowther said there's evidence that providing blood thinners to patients after they leave the hospital on the whole lowers the risk of clotting incidents.

Treating clotting complications in COVID-19 patients
In the absence of sturdy scientific evidence backing up whether one approach or another is best, doctors are debating the best way to treat the disease, especially in critically ill patients. Studies are ongoing on whether clot-busting drugs — typically used to treat strokes — are a better approach. 
Early on in the coronavirus outbreak, doctors in the US were hearing from colleagues in China about the virus' effects on the heart, Dr. Thomas Maddox, who serves as chair of the science and quality committee of the American College of Cardiology, told Business Insider in an April interview. 
The effects seemed to be related to both a viral invasion of the heart and to the stress of fighting the respiratory disease.
With COVID-19, doctors are also seeing blood clots occurring in the lungs and bodies of patients on ventilators, Dr. Greg Martin, a professor of pulmonary critical care at Emory University and president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, previously told Business Insider.
Other viruses can cause blood problems as well, Crowther noted. For instance, Ebola causes bleeding. 
Also, blood clots aren't uncommon in severely ill patients in intensive care units, or even in hospitalizations. While in the ICU, patients are typically on breathing support and sedated, which limits their ability to move as they heal. Staying still raises the risk of clots.
But the rate at which clots are popping up appears to be higher in critically ill COVID-19 patients. In a recent observational study, Dutch researchers reported that about one-third of the 184 coronavirus patients they observed in the intensive-care unit had a complication associated with a clot.
""We think it's one of the most important, if not the most important, issue with respect to monitoring sick hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"" Dr. Alex Spyropoulos, an expert on blood clots at Northwell Health in New York said in an April interview.
Clotting occurring outside the hospital
For now, most of the conversation is about what to do to prevent blood clot complications in hospitalized patients. 
But, researchers are wondering whether clotting complications are happening in milder COVID-19 cases that don't require a hospital stay. That's a question that's far from being answered, particularly given the lack of routine testing available. 
The other question is whether blood clots are causing problems after COVID-19 patients leave the hospital, leading to sudden deaths. Spyropolous said he's concerned about complications arising after patients are discharged.
In early autopsy data from Northwell, there appear to be major clotting events like a massive heart attack or lung clots in 40% of patients who have died after leaving the hospital, Business Insider previously reported.
Michael Reagan, a 49-year-old COVID-19 patient, told Business Insider he was recovering from the illness when doctors found blood clots in his lungs. After an overnight stay, Reagan was sent home with a prescription for a blood thinner.
""It feels like a toxin is in my body,"" Reagan told Business Insider in April.

""Six members of the advance team tested positive out of hundreds of tests performed, and quarantine procedures were immediately implemented.""
Murtaugh said that none of the positive staffers or anyone who had been in ""immediate contact"" would be at the rally or near attendees or elected officials. 
""As previously announced, all rally attendees are given temperature checks before going through security, at which point they are given wristbands, facemasks, and hand sanitizer,"" he said. 
Murtaugh did not say exactly when the six staffers tested positive or what their specific roles were on the campaign. The positive cases were first reported by NBC News' Kelly O'Donnell.

As Business Insider previously reported, health experts have warned the Saturday rally could be a COVID-19 superspreader event, which research suggests could be the culprit for a majority of COVID-19 cases. 
The president's own advisers reportedly expressed concerns about the rally at the venue that holds around 19,000 people, though the president and his campaign have pushed ahead with his first rally since the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
The BOK Center on Thursday said it requested a more detailed health and safety plan from the campaign, including how it planned to enforce social distancing, but it had not sent one to the venue as of Friday evening, NBC News reported.
Representatives for the BOK Center have not returned Business Insider's request for comment. The Trump Campaign has not returned numerous Business Insider requests about whether it had or would send such a written plan to the venue. 
On Saturday, Tulsa County reported 136 new coronavirus cases — the highest single-day total since the pandemic began, while the state health agency reported 331 new cases. On Thursday, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported 450 new COVID-19 cases, breaking the state's all-time record set the day before.

The President of the United States of America has spent the past few weeks touting a dangerous drug called hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the presidents expertise is in reality TV, not medicine. Severalstudies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, a drug designed to treat malaria, has dangerous side-effects when used to treat coronavirus, including death.
The quest for a COVID-19 drug that will both make Donald Trump and his friends in the pharmaceutical industry rich and not kill the people who take it has, so far, netted no results. But exciting government-sponsored research out of Canada seems to indicate a different approach is in order.
Per the teams research paper:
We have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells.
What this means is the team has carefully developed several cannabis strains that have been experimentally shown to make it significantly more difficult for the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus to find a home inside of the tissue cells it latches onto in order to infect us with the COVID-19 disease.
It does not mean you should run out to your local dispensary and exhaust their sativa and CBD supply. The 13 strains cultivated by the researchers are almost certainly very different from whatever wacky-named strains youre going to purchase over the counter. But, if you must take an untested treatment, I recommend taking Canadas lead and legally imbibing cannabis instead of listening to the Trump administration.

A recent study led by Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra which looked at data from more than 96,000 COVID-19 patients, 15,000 of which had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, clearly showed that patients using the drug were at far greater risk for death than those who did not. Per a report from the Washington Post:
For those given hydroxychloroquine, there was a 34 percent increase in risk of mortality and a 137 percent increased risk of a serious heart arrhythmias. For those receiving hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic the cocktail endorsed by Trump there was a 45 percent increased risk of death and a 411 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias.
Those given chloroquine had a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 256 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. For those taking chloroquine and an antibiotic, there was a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 301 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias.
Donald Trump recently told reporters and the US public that hed been taking hydroxycholoroquine as a preventative measure to ward off COVID-19. Excepting the fact he has a small financial stake in Plaquenil the drug name for hydroxycholoroquine if he really wants to prevent COVID-19 he should imbibe cannabis. Theres no peer-reviewed evidence showing itll work, but at least it wont kill him.

Some studies report that over a third of patients show neurological symptoms.
In the vast majority of cases, COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that causes fever, aches, tiredness, sore throat, cough, and, in more severe cases, shortness of breath and respiratory distress. Yet we now understand that COVID-19 can also infect cells outside of the respiratory tract and cause a wide range of symptoms from the gastrointestinal disease (diarrhea and nausea) to heart damage and blood clotting disorders. It appears that we have to add neurological symptoms to this list, too.
Several recent studies have identified the presence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 cases. Some of these studies are case reports where symptoms are observed in individuals. Several reports have described COVID-19 patients suffering from GuillainBarré syndrome. GuillainBarré syndrome is a neurological disorder where the immune system responds to an infection and ends up mistakenly attacking nerve cells, resulting in muscle weakness and eventually paralysis.
Read: [A brief history of coronaviruses and why COVID-19 is different]
Other case studies have described severe COVID-19 encephalitis (brain inflammation and swelling) and stroke in healthy young people with otherwise mild COVID-19 symptoms.
Larger studies from China and France have also investigated the prevalence of neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients. These studies have shown that 36% of patients have neurological symptoms. Many of these symptoms were mild and include things like headaches or dizziness that could be caused by a robust immune response. Other more specific and severe symptoms were also seen and include loss of smell or taste, muscle weakness, stroke, seizure, and hallucinations.
Some people lose their sense of smell. Elipetit/Shutterstock
These symptoms are seen more often in severe cases, with estimates ranging from 46%to 84% of severe cases showing neurological symptoms. Changes in consciousness, such as disorientation, inattention, and movement disorders, were also seen in severe cases and found to persist after recovery.
Crossing the blood-brain barrier
SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, may cause neurological disorders by directly infecting the brain or as a result of the strong activation of the immune system.
Recent studies have found the novel coronavirus in the brains of fatal cases of COVID-19. It has also been suggested that infection of olfactory neurons in the nose may enable the virus to spread from the respiratory tract to the brain.
Cells in the human brain express the ACE2 protein on their surface. ACE2 is a protein involved in blood pressure regulation and is the receptor the virus uses to enter and infect cells. ACE2 is also found on endothelial cells that line blood vessels. Infection of endothelial cells may allow the virus to pass from the respiratory tract to the blood and then across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. Once in the brain, replication of the virus may cause neurological disorders.
SARS-CoV-2 infection also results in a very strong response by the immune system. This immune response may directly cause neurological disorders in the form of GuillainBarré syndrome. But brain inflammation might also indirectly cause neurological damage, such as through brain swelling. And its associated with though doesnt necessarily cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons.
Not unique, but still worrying
SARS-CoV-2 is not unique in being a respiratory virus that can also infect the brain. Influenza, measles, and respiratory syncytial viruses can all infect the brain or central nervous system and cause neurological disease.
Other coronaviruses have also been found to infect the brain and cause neurological disorders. The related seasonal coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, typically causes very mild respiratory symptoms but can also cause encephalitis in humans. Similarly, the coronavirus that causes Mers and the 2003 Sars virus can cause severe neurological disorders.
Respiratory viruses getting into the brain is thankfully a rare occurrence. But with millions of COVID-19 infections worldwide, there is the risk of significant neurological disease, especially in severe cases.
It is important to be aware of the possibility of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, both during acute illness as well as the possibility of long-term effects. This also highlights the continued importance of preventing viral transmission and identifying those who are and have been, infected.

Also on Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Trump refuses to wear a mask or other face covering in public, which the CDC recommends to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, because he fears it would make him look ""ridiculous"" and even risk his re-election chances. 
Throughout the coronavirus crisis, Pence has also frequently disregarded his own task force's and administration's guidance that Americans wear face coverings in public, receiving an avalanche of criticism for flouting the Mayo Clinic's requirement that all visitors wear masks in an April 28 visit to the clinic's Minnesota headquarters. 
In April, The New York Times reported that Pence felt he didn't need to wear a mask because he had been tested and was showing no symptoms. But as the newspaper noted, Pence could still contract the highly contagious novel coronavirus even though he's tested negative, or have a false negative test.
""When the face-covering guidelines were developed, it was with the intention to not only protect yourself, but primarily to protect others from asymptomatic spread,"" Katie Miller, Pence's spokeswoman, told The Times.

ICE reported the death in a statement on Thursday.
""On May 6, Carlos Escobar Mejia was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. local time by medical professionals at the Paradise Valley Hospital in National City, California, where he had been hospitalized since April 24, after exhibiting COVID-19 related symptoms,"" the agency said.
Escobar-Mejia had been detained since January 10 at the Otay Mesa Detention Center near the US-Mexico border in San Diego. Run by the for-profit prison company CoreCivic, the facility has seen over 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to records obtained by the San Diego Union-Tribune. The detention center had been called a ""death trap,"" by detainees who spoke to NBC last month.
On May 1, a federal judge ordered ICE to release people from the Otay Mesa Detention Center who stand a high risk of suffering serious consequences from contracting the coronavirus. The decision was the product of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the agency's first death should be a wake-up call.
""ICE detention is cruel, unnecessary, and fundamentally unfair. It should have never been a death sentence for Mr. Escobar Mejia, whose death in custody was entirely preventable,"" Monika Y. Langarica, immigrants' rights staff attorney at the ACLU of San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties, told Business Insider. ""Rather than justify its choice to continue unnecessarily detaining him during this pandemic, ICE should immediately turn its attention to releasing people in its custody to avoid needless repetition of this tragedy.""
ICE, in a statement, claimed it was working to prevent future such deaths, saying it has ""evaluated its detained population based upon the CDC's guidance."" It has released 900 people since March, the agency said, ""after evaluating their immigration history, criminal record, potential threat to public safety, flight risk, and national security concerns.""
Escobar Mejia, who had a three-decade-old conviction for a DUI, was not one of them.
""Instead of releasing Carlos from detention, when he was already medically vulnerable, ICE only acted when it had no choice because his health had deteriorated so significantly,"" Denise Bell, a researcher on refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International, told Business Insider. ""ICE could act to ensure the health of people in its custody and care, but instead chooses to demonstrate reckless disregard for lives.""
ICE spokesperson Paige Hughes insisted that the agency did nothing wrong.
""Escobar Mejia was denied an immigration bond by an immigration judge on April 14 due to flight risk,"" Hughes told Business Insider. ""He was tested when he began showing symptoms April 24, and was hospitalized that same day.""
The agency reportedly knew upon admission that Escobar-Mejia suffered from hypertension and diabetes.
Bell rejected ICE's statement."" ICE had the authority to release him, and it chose not to,"" she said. ""Once again, instead of acting to protect people, ICE chose to stand by and do nothing.""
The deceased was arrested at the beginning of the year by immigration officers in Chula Vista while in a car with a friend.
""If that hadn't happened, my brother would be here with me,"" his sister, Rosa, told the Los Angeles Times. He was the only sibling who failed to obtain legal residency, she said.

The research looked at ""limited airborne transmission"" of the virus between cats that had been administered with the virus and other cats without the virus who lived in the same household.
Three cats with no previous COVID-19 infection were inoculated with the virus and were paired with three virus-free cats in order to monitor if the virus could be spread to the healthy cats by direct transmission. Researchers took nasal and rectal swab specimens from the cats daily to test for the virus. 
The research found that within three days, the virus was detected in all the cats that were inoculated, and within eight days, all previously healthy cats had also tested positive for the virus. According to the report, virus shedding in the cats that were not inoculated lasted four to five days.

Research conducted last month suggested that cats may be more susceptible to infection from the new coronavirus and may be able to spread it to other cats. Still, experts say most pets probably aren't at risk, and there's no evidence the virus can spread from pets to pet owners.
Still, there is some evidence that indicates that the new coronavirus may be able to spread from humans to felines.
Last month, the Bronx Zoo announced in a press statement that five of its tigers and three African lions tested positive for the new coronavirus after being infected ""by a staff person who was asymptomatically infected with the virus or before that person developed symptoms.""
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture announced in a joint statement last month that the first confirmed cases of the virus in US pets were detected in two cats. The cats lived in separate households. 
Notably, no human members of the household where one of the cats lived were confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19.
""The virus may have been transmitted to this cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home,"" the statement said.
The owner of the second cat tested positive for COVID-19 before the pet showed signs of illness.

<li>Dr. Anthony Fauci said that there's little chance that the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, will be completely eradicated in an interview with NBC Sports.</li>
<li>Fauci said that with ""global travel, every single day, of literal…",https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-theres-virtually-no-chance-covid-19-will-be-eradicated-2020-5,https://i.insider.com/5eb75143cdfd480e633ebf15?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-05-11T18:19:32Z,"Dr. Anthony Fauci said that there's ""virtually no chance"" that the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, will be completely eradicated in an interview with NBC Sports football writer and columnist Peter King. 
While many sports fans are hopeful that the virus' will be controlled enough to hold a regular football season in the fall, Fauci warned that given how contagious the virus is and how easily it can be spread by people with no symptoms, the logistical hurdles to holding any kind of large-scale team sports will be immense. 
Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, compared the novel coronavirus with the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, a disease caused by another form coronavirus that is quite similar in genetic form to the novel coronavirus, but spread less quickly. 
""So, unlike the virus SARS, back in 2002, when we had an outbreak of about 8,000 people and close to 800 deaths, and then the virus just essentially petered out by good public health measures by the simple reason that it wasn't efficiently or effectively transmitted from one person to another,"" Fauci said.
As of Monday, there are over four million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including 1.3 million cases in the United States. The death toll in the US is nearing 80,000 lives lost. And while some parts of the US are seeing case counts decline, the vast majority of states aren't testing nearly enough people per day to consider safely reopening for business, according to estimates from the Harvard Global Health Institute.
""It is so transmissible, and it is so widespread throughout the world, that even if our infections get well-controlled and go down dramatically during the summer, there is virtually no chance it will be eradicated,"" Fauci said of the novel coronavirus. 
Fauci told NBC that even if the US gets its case numbers under control and adopts effective mitigation measures, it'll be particularly difficult to stop the virus altogether once the US and the world start to resume regular international flights and other travel. 
""There will be infections in the Southern Hemisphere, in South Africa, in Argentina, places like that,"" Fauci said. ""And with the travel, the global travel, every single day, of literally hundreds of thousands of people coming into the United States every day from all over, there's no chance we're going to be virus-free.""
The coronavirus is both more contagious and more deadly than other viral illnesses like seasonal influenza, and a vaccine against it almost certainly won't be available by the time flu season comes around. While initial phase one vaccines are underway at a record pace, a deployable vaccine won't be able for another 12 to 18 months by the most optimistic estimates.  
In the absence of a vaccine, Fauci and other public health experts are advocating for mass testing at a far greater scale, a robust army of contact tracers to locate and stop outbreaks in their tracks, and selective isolation and quarantining for the sick. 
""Now, even if the virus goes down dramatically in June and July and August, as the virus starts returning in the fall, it would be in my mind, shame on us if we don't have in place all of the mechanisms to prevent it from blowing up again,"" Fauci added. ""In other words, enough testing to test everybody that needs to be tested. Enough testing so that when someone gets infected, you could immediately do contact tracing and isolation to prevent the infection from going to a couple of infections to hundreds of infections. That's how you control an outbreak.""

At that pace, it would take more than four years to test every American.
""This is a start but [the White House is] not yet serious about keeping [the] economy open,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said on Twitter. ""I don't get it.""
Experts agree that widespread testing is crucial in order to safely lift lockdowns across the US. Local health authorities must be able to test widely for COVID-19 in order to track the pathogen's spread through the population as people mingle and go back to work. That way, states, counties, and cities can isolate infected people and impose new restrictions if necessary to slow the virus's spread before cases overwhelm local hospitals.
But to hit that goal, the White House's new plan is ""inadequate,"" Jha said, noting that it could result in a disastrous surge in cases that would force another lockdown.
""If you're not testing and people are getting sick out there, then by the time they show up to your hospital, you have a huge wave coming and it's too late,"" he told Business Insider. ""That's what happened to us the first time.""
The White House plan could force another lockdown in 2 months

To open the country quickly and safely (given current testing capacities) Jha has recommended a ""bare minimum"" of roughly half a million tests per day — enough for 4% of the US population each month.

Something is loading.
""I don't know, right now, how to get up to 10 to 20 million times a day,"" Jha said. ""With 500,000 to 700,000 a day, we have a shot of opening the economy and keeping it going for more than six weeks or two months. If we don't do this, we're going to basically find ourselves with large numbers of cases and having to shut down again in two to two-and-a-half months.""
The White House plan falls far short of that, providing only enough tests for roughly 200,000 Americans each day, and also does not provide a clear timeline or roadmap for exactly when testing would ramp up or how tests would get distributed to states.
Many states have their own testing infrastructure, but even assuming the White House tests were added to that existing capacity, it still wouldn't meet Jha's goal. The COVID Tracking Project reported that 1.5 million tests conducted nationwide last week — roughly 200,000 each day.
Plus, Jha said, even more testing will be needed in the early fall, when the virus could make a resurgence as flu season begins.
""If we go into the fall with 500,000 [daily tests], we're going to get crushed,"" he said. 
Still, he added, ""I am more optimistic we'll have 10 million tests a day in September than I am we'll have 500,000 tests a day in May.""

Testing alone is not enough to protect the US from another disastrous surge in coronavirus cases. To contain new outbreaks, experts say, the country also needs an army of contact tracers to track down anyone who came into contact with an infected person. Those contacts must be informed of their exposure and self-isolate for 14 days.
""If all you're doing is testing, then you're just going to spot it getting worse and there's nothing you can do to stop it and cut off transmission,"" Jha said. ""So there it's not just how many tests you have, but what services you have to back up those tests.""
On Monday, a bipartisan group of public health experts wrote a letter to Congress proposing a $46.5 billion plan to safely reopen the economy. The plan emphasized three major spending areas: expanding the contract-tracing workforce, transforming vacant hotels into self-isolation facilities, and offering $50 a day to people who voluntarily self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected person.
Such measures could help prevent a future lockdown once the virus starts spreading again.
""It's going to be super costly over the long run to have to shut down again,"" Jha said. ""Don't shut down again. Don't find yourself in the same place that we found ourselves in a-month-and-a-half ago."""

We first saw the news via the BBC.
""YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS,"" a YouTube spokeswoman told BBC News. 
Icke has spread misinformation for years via social and traditional media, and his YouTube channel had close to 1 million subscribers at the time of its deletion. The straw that broke the camel's back seems to have been Icke baselessly linking COVID-19 symptoms to 5G mobile networks, in violation of YouTube's policies. 
The 68-year-old has been an active conspiracy theorist for over two decades. Among other controversial views, he disputes accepted explanations regarding the cause of the 9/11 attacks. In 2018, Business Insider discovered that YouTube was pushing Icke's conspiracy theories to kids via its YouTube Kids app.
But his mainstream social media presence looks to be crumbling fast after Facebook removed his official page from its platform earlier this month.
The baseless notion that COVID-19 is caused by 5G mobile networks has gained traction internationally, with multiple phone masts across the UK – Icke's home country – being subjected to acts of vandalism in recent weeks. 
YouTube will still allow third-party content featuring Icke to remain on its platform.
YouTube did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

<li>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing that the state close two prisons, in part due to a decline in tax revenue amid the pandemic.</li>
<li>Over 500 California prisoners currently have COVID-19. At least five have died.</li>
<li>""As we have seen,…",https://www.businessinsider.com/california-governor-closing-2-prisons-in-response-to-covid-19-2020-5,https://i.insider.com/5ebf2be03ad861344f47b183?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-05-16T01:18:33Z,"Left-leaning activists for social justice do not, typically, have kind words for austerity, which brings to mind shuttered schools and trimmed welfare rolls. But when California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined plans this week to slash the state's budget, citing a freefall in tax revenue due to the pandemic, there was qualified praise from some over his decision to cut funding for prisons.
California currently has over 117,000 people in its prisons, more than any other state except for Texas. But the number of incarcerated persons has been falling  — by 8% just this year — and that, the product of reduced sentences for drug crimes and efforts to address overcrowding, has meant the state is in a position to begin closing some of its prisons.
In January, Newsom, a Democrat, wanted to close one detention center. Now he wants to close two — and to do it fast. That will save money; according to the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, by more than $100 million per year. It could also save lives.
""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider. ""Closed quarters, lack of circulating air, and staff and vendors who are not regularly tested — and walk in and out — are recipes for public health disasters.""
At least five people have died from COVID-19 while incarcerated in a state prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; another 524 currently have caught the disease while behind bars.
Last month, Kamlager, who chairs the state committee on incarcerated women, told Business Insider that she hoped that efforts to reduce the prison population, in an effort to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, would extend beyond the current crisis.
Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, ""is excited to see the commitment from the governor to close prisons."" But her organization, a coalition of 70 activist groups that advocate cutting prison spending, says the governor's proposal is just a start.
""We believe that California can close five prisons in the next five years,"" Howard told Business Insider. In part, that can be achieved by accelerating early release, as California has started to do in response to the coronavirus. ""Over 20% of the prison population is over the age of 55,"" she noted. ""We need to see the state pushing for elder parole modifications that would release a larger population of people, who statistically have the least risk of contact with law enforcement after release.""
Newsom's proposal, which will require approval by California's Democratic-controlled legislature, already gestures at that, proposing to cut the maximum length of parole — and thus the chances one could be incarcerated over a parole violation — from five years to 24 months.
But with 34 prisons, and plans to close only two over the next three years, critics of mass incarceration see much room for improvement, from the governor granting clemency more often, to voters themselves overturning the state's notorious ""three strikes"" sentencing law. 
""I believe there is a better way,"" Rep. Kamlager commented. ""The current system is not it.""

Investors were treated to a bleak about-face from a positive report on Monday relating to Moderna's coronavirus vaccine candidate.

Moderna shares tumbled as much as 12% on the news after climbing 20% the prior day.

Still, the losses paled in comparison to the commodity's previous expiration-date moves.

Earlier this week, the biotech company Moderna, which has partnered with the National Institutes of Health, announced early findings from the first phase of trials for a COVID-19 vaccine, which was tested on 45 human volunteers.
The early results were encouraging: eight of those in the trial developed a specific type of antibody (a neutralizing antibody) that is associated with stopping the virus from infecting people. (As Fauci said, neutralizing antibodies bind to the ""business end of the virus and block its ability to infect."")
While acknowledging that vaccine development is still in early stages, Fauci, director of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Disease, noted to CNN that this result was not a given — and ""that's why I'm cautiously optimistic about it.""
""The question is: Was it immediately safe? Clearly, it was,"" Fauci said of the prospective vaccine. ""But, importantly, it induced the kind of response that you would predict would be protective against the virus.""
""It was really quite good news,"" he added.
Several companies are working to develop a preventative solution for the coronavirus. On Thursday, the US government agreed to pay British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca up to $1.2 billion to secure 300 million doses of its experimental vaccine.

XpresSpa Group announced Friday that it would begin a pilot test of providing COVID-19 tests at JFK International Airport in New York. The company said it would launch a new brand — XpresCheck — which would operate under a subsidiary — XpresTest.
The initial pilot will take place in JFK's Terminal 4, which saw 21.8 million passengers in 2018, making it among the nation's busiest.
The company said that it would build a ""new modular constructed testing facility within the terminal,"" rather than using its spa location — all of the company's airport locations have been temporarily closed because of the pandemic.
Initially, tests will be available for airline and airport workers and contractors, as well as TSA officers and Customs and Border Patrol agents.
As governments, public health officials, and airline executives explore options for testing workers and passengers, part of a larger effort to bring travel demand back without risking further spreading the disease, companies have been scrambling to find ways to lever ege their existing airport infrastructure.
CLEAR, a biometric identification company that operates at numerous US airports and event venues, has also indicated that it was moving into the health screening arena. The company is introducing a product to link personal health information to verified IDs, allowing businesses to efficiently screen employees for COVID-19 before they return to workplaces.
CLEAR has not announced any imminent plans to bring the program to airports, although its existing framework and cooperation with the TSA at airport screening checkpoints would make it a likely candidate.
The TSA is also widely expected to begin performing temperature checks on passengers at airports.
XpresSpa said it was working with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey — which manages the region's airports — to expand the pilot to additional locations, and that it was exploring converting airport spa shops to test sites in other regions.
It was not immediately clear whether the testing would be for active virus, or for antibodies from past infections, nor whether rapid results would be available.

Shares in Gilead Sciences slipped 4% on Monday after a late-stage coronavirus drug trial showed that remdesivir had limited success treating moderately ill patients. 
The company said that remdesivir helped patients in the trial with ""moderate"" disease recover more quickly when they took it for five days but it had limited benefits for patients who took it for 10 days.
Gilead said patients in the group that received remdesivir for five days were 65% more likely to show signs of clinical improvement compared to those who got usual care, without receiving the drug.
Remdesivir has been tested as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. It has been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been approved for use in Japan. 
While Monday's results affirm that remdesivir does have some success in treating COVID-19 it may raise questions how beneficial it will be overall.

Earlier test results in April showed hospitalized, severely ill COVID-19 patients recovered 31% faster when taking remdesivir instead of a placebo, according to results released by the US National Institutes of Health.
Gilead Sciences said in a statement: ""We now have three randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that remdesivir improved clinical outcomes by several different measures.""
""Today's results showed that when treating moderate disease, a five-day course of remdesivir led to greater clinical improvement than standard care, adding further evidence of remdesivir's benefit to previously released study results.""

Narrator: When coronavirus outbreaks shut down meat-processing plants across the US, animals headed here were suddenly stranded here.
Mike Patterson: As time has gone on and plants haven't been able to operate, that's created a big backlog of pigs.
Narrator: With nowhere to send their pigs, some farmers were forced to euthanize their herds. 
Jayson Lusk: You're literally talking about millions and millions of pigs that were intended to go to market but are still remaining on the farm.
 Narrator: The backup at farms led to record-breaking meat prices and cleared-out shelves. The US was in the midst of a meat shortage.
Anya Fernald: You start with the ethics of it, like, animals live and die to make your product, and then you get to the concentration of it. It's a pretty hairy beast.
Narrator: But why did this all happen? And how can we avoid it from happening in the future? America is the world's leading producer of beef and poultry. It's also one of the top producers of pork in the world. In the US alone, an estimated 9 billion animals are slaughtered a year.
In order to process all that meat, the industry is efficient and concentrated. Simply put, as many animals as possible move from the farm to the slaughterhouse as quickly as possible. When the system works, US meat prices are among the most affordable on the planet. But that efficiency becomes a problem in the face of COVID-19. For one, workers operate in tight quarters.
Lusk: They're in refrigerated environments with recirculating air. This was an environment in which COVID could apparently be spread easily from worker to worker.
Narrator: An estimated 25,000 meatpacking workers have contracted COVID-19. And outbreaks in 167 plants forced 38 in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa to close. Since only a small number of plants handle most of the industry's meat...
Lusk: When any one of them closes, it has an impact on the entire industry.
Fernald: It's like the only store shut down in town and you can't get milk [laughs] if you're a farmer.
Lusk: By early May, beef and pork plants were running at about 40% below the processing volumes we saw just a year ago. So that's an enormous reduction in processing volumes and caused all kinds of disruptions.
Narrator: This has hit farmers like Mike hard.
Patterson: When COVID started really impacting the plants, our percentage of utilization of the plants just kind of kept going down and down and down. That's created a real backlog of pigs.
Narrator: Every year, Mike and his co-op send about 150,000 hogs to the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. But when COVID-19 closed that plant, they had nowhere to send their animals.
Patterson: We got our letter April 11 that the Smithfield plant was gonna be closed. Turned out to be four weeks that they didn't receive any hogs in Sioux Falls.
Narrator: Remember, the meat industry is streamlined to be exact.
Patterson: We're looking for a uniform end product. Last ones were 284. These might be... I think they're gonna be pretty close to that. It's real similar.
Narrator: All the pigs Mike, or any farmer, sends to a plant have to weigh about 280 pounds.
Lusk: If it gets above 300, 330 pounds, the plants are just not configured to take animals of that size.
Narrator: Mike tried to put them on a diet.
Patterson: Right now, it's just basically ground corn. There's some vitamins and minerals and salt in there. Now, usually we would have soybean meal, dried distillers grains from the ethanol process in there as well. But those feeds are more expensive, and we were trying to slow their growth. This diet should slow them down to about one pound a day, and usually they're gaining two, two and a half pounds a day at this stage.
Narrator: But even on a diet, they were growing beyond the 280-pound mark by the day. It was a no-win scenario. They had shipments of baby pigs still coming in from nursing farms. They were running out of space and feed. The current pigs were getting too fat, and factories were still closed.
Lusk: Last-case situation is unfortunately where farmers have to consider euthanizing some animals. Narrator: Combined, Mike's cooperative has had to euthanize over 3,400 pigs.
Patterson: About a half million dollars' worth.
Narrator: But Mike estimates if you add in the feed costs, the loss for his co-op is upwards of $1.5 million.
Lusk: I don't know that it's even possible to compare the economic losses to sort of the psychological impact that this has on producers. Neither one are positive. It's really kind of a double whammy, I think.
Narrator: The situation Mike's co-op faced was happening all over the country.
Lusk: So, one way to think about it is like this: In this country, we have a processing capacity of about 500,000 pigs per day.
Narrator: Remember, the industry was running at about 40% below capacity.
Lusk: If you do the math every day, that's an extra 200,000 pigs that were meant to go to market but instead stayed on the farm. So you do that for five days, which happened, that's a million extra pigs that were gonna go to market.
Narrator: After a couple of weeks, that's millions of pigs at risk of being euthanized. All of this is why consumers have seen higher meat prices and those empty shelves, which Jason estimates may stretch out for at least another six months.
Since mid-May, things have started getting better. Factories like Smithfield Sioux Falls have reopened with limited production and social-distancing measures. Euthanization of animals has slowed, and as a result, production and meat prices have started to stabilize.
But what can we do so this doesn't happen again? One option is to rely more on smaller, vertically integrated farms.
Fernald: When you see a piece of meat in the grocery store, it's typically been touched by 15 or 20 different types of companies, and all of those companies are hyper-specialized and they operate at a really efficient scale.
Narrator: That's Anya. She owns Belcampo Farms, a vertically integrated meat company out in Northern California.
Fernald: Our supply chain relies entirely on our own infrastructure. We own our own farms, our own slaughterhouse, and several direct-to-consumer businesses.
Narrator: Belcampo's home to 3,000 grass-fed organic cattle. They have 30,000 acres to roam and live seven to 10 times longer than conventional cattle. The slaughtering process is also slowed down, with only 50 to 60 animals processed a day in a slaughterhouse that Belcampo owns, just 20 minutes from the farm.
Fernald: I think of it as, like, intentional inefficiency.
Narrator: And because Belcampo exists outside of the normal meat industry...
Fernald: We're not reliant on the broader meat infrastructure. Since we have our own slaughterhouse that we've had extremely aggressive and proactive safety measures in, we have not had any issues.
Narrator: This also made it easier for Anya to start social-distancing measures in the plant before the CDC required it.
Fernald: We implemented mandatory temp checking and a questionnaire every day as of, like, March 18.
Narrator: Direct-to-consumer models could be another shake-up in the industry, cutting out distribution centers. Anya's e-commerce site saw unprecedented traffic, and her app delivering meat to homes in San Francisco and LA...
Fernald: Went from, like, 3,000 to 20,000 users in the past month.
Narrator: As for the bigger meat companies at the heart of this issue, Jayson has a few ideas. More medium-sized plants, for starters, so if one goes down, it doesn't take the whole supply chain with it.
Lusk: Even if you're one of the large processors, you may think about giving up some of that economies of scale to maybe reduce some risks.
Narrator: But Jayson says the most effective change would be:
Lusk: Automation.
Narrator: Robots don't get sick.
Lusk: It's just hard. We're not putting together car parts that are uniform in shape and size. Animals are different sizes, shapes, weights.
Narrator: But whether or not the meat industry will make any of these changes comes down to what the consumers demand and how much they're willing to pay for any real changes.
Fernald: That's been a choice we've been making with our wallets for years, where we love cheap protein. Are customers gonna pay up for a secure supply chain? And I think that the more we talk about it, the more people are gonna raise their hands and say, ""I'm opting out.""
Abby Narishkin: Hey, guys. My name's Abby, and I'm the producer on this video. One thing that came up in our reporting was whether or not this meat shortage would lead to more nonmeat purchases, like if you're at the grocery store and you go and get chicken but there isn't any, do you then turn to pick up soy nuggets?

US stock indexes gained on Wednesday as traders shrugged off dismal economic data and instead focused on promising drug trial news out of Gilead.
The biotech firm revealed its leading coronavirus drug remdesivir succeeded in a key study, saying ""the trial has met its primary endpoint."" Additional information on the drug's performance is set to be revealed later in the day at a briefing. Markets have previously soared on such news as investors wait for a viable option to combat the coronavirus.
Gilead shares surged as much as 11% following the report's release. Trading was initially halted on the news.

The optimistic biotech news largely overshadowed dire updates to the nation's economic situation. US gross domestic product contracted by 4.8% in the first quarter, its worst decline since the financial crisis. Economists expected the metric to slide by 3.8%, according to Bloomberg data. The update officially ended the US's longest-ever economic expansion.
Wall Street is also looking to the Federal Reserve for any hints at how the US economic recovery may play out. The Federal Open Market Committee wraps up two days of meetings on Wednesday and may issue fresh guidance on the central bank's policy playbook.
Alphabet's post-earnings bounce further lifted indexes. The Google parent soared as much as 8% in early trading after revenue bested expectations. While CEO Sundar Pichai warned of a drastic slowdown in advertising sales, he praised YouTube and Google Cloud's revenue growth through the chaotic first quarter.
Oil retraced some losses posted earlier in the week, leaping 18% to $14.57 per barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude leaped 5% to $23.39 per barrel. The gains follow the American Petroleum Institute reportedly saying oil inventories increased by nearly 10 million barrels last week, falling below analysts' 12 million barrel estimate. The statement suggests storage demand may be waning after last week's market meltdown.

""We are strongest when we work together; this includes our battle against COVID-19,"" she said in a statement posted on her office's website. ""I request that the tribes immediately cease interfering with or regulating traffic on US and State Highways and remove all travel checkpoints.""
In the letters, also posted online, she said the checkpoints are out of compliance with an April 8 memorandum from the US Department of the Interior, which required tribes to consult and enter into an agreement with the state before restricting travel on state or US highways. 
""The State of South Dakota objects to tribal checkpoints on US and State Highways regardless of whether those checkpoints take into consideration the safety measures recommended by the SD DOT,"" Noem wrote in the letters. ""Safety recommendations do not constitute consultation and certainly do not equal agreement."" 
If the tribes don't remove the checkpoints within 48 hours, the state ""will take necessary legal action,"" Noem wrote.
Noem has a contentious history with the Native American community in her state. In early 2019, she led efforts to pass a state law targeting demonstrations by anti-oil pipeline activities. The Oglala Sioux tribe later told her she was unwelcome in the Pine Ridge Reservation, one of the largest reservations in the country, until she rescinded her support for such laws.

Both tribes have issued strict stay-at-home orders and curfews for their communities, although Noem has not issued such orders for the state, according to CNN. 
Residents of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, for one, are allowed to leave for essential activities like going to doctor's appointments in areas not deemed COVID-19 hotspots, but first must fill out a health questionnaire and pass through a checkpoint, according to policies posted on its social media. They have to complete another form before returning. 
The checkpoints also filter non-residents, requiring them to fill out questionnaires before entering, which they can only do for essential activities. If they're coming from out of state or from a COVID-19 hotspot, they have to obtain a travel permit from the tribe's website.
It's unclear how the Oglala Sioux tribe's checkpoints operate. 
A spokesperson for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe told The Rapid City Journal the tribe has seen Noem's letter and given it to council members, but did not yet have a comment in response.
As of May 8, South Dakota had 3,145 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 31 deaths, with 169 cases of Covid-19 among Native Americans, according to the state health department."

<li>The basic idea of an immunity passport is to link an individual's identity with the…",https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-immunity-passports-race-id-startups-yoti-onfido-2020-5,https://i.insider.com/5eb410df204ad35c7e6480cb?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-05-08T07:01:00Z,"Prior the pandemic, the idea of issuing citizens with ""immunity passports"" to prove to authorities, employers and loved ones they weren't infected with a deadly disease would have sounded unhinged.
But as COVID-19 swept across the planet – so far infecting almost 4 million people and killing around 250,000 – governments everywhere have been forced to battle an invisible enemy, enforcing unprecedented curbs on civil liberties while reassessing the role of technology and their citizens' right to privacy. 
Among the tech solutions on the table are contact-tracing apps, which have been trialed with mixed results. These have highlighted a power struggle between governments and Big Tech, as Apple and Google put forward the building blocks of their own apps with strict privacy stipulations.
Another option being considered by some is nationwide rollouts of immunity passports.
The basic idea is to link a person's identity with their COVID-19 test status, potentially allowing people who have recovered from the virus to return to work and normal life.
Most solutions rely on some combination of facial recognition, ID documents like passports or driving licences, and the distribution of unique QR codes.
With all three elements in place, ID firms such as Yoti, Onfido and IDnow – all of which have held talks with the UK government – say their software will allow users to reliably provide their COVID-19 test results on the spot. 
But depending on who you're talking to, these passports are either a magic bullet with the potential to end lockdowns everywhere, or a naive fantasy. 
Last month, the World Health Organization warned there was ""not enough evidence"" to show they could be useful, in large part because there isn't enough evidence to show those who have recovered from the virus become immune.
If an individual needed to prove their health status – to the police or anyone else – that information would need to be unalterably linked to their identity.
COVID-19 could create a new market for ID startups
Hancock confirmed the UK government was 'looking into' immunity passports
Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/Handout via REUTERS
The global ID verification market was already set to be worth close to $13 billion by 2024, but calls for immunity passports or similar solutions around the world could boost that figure. 
Edgar Whitley, a professor at the London School of Economics, told Business Insider there could be ""significant demand"" for such solutions in the future. 
""Although there is no useful science behind immunity as of yet,"" he said. ""I suspect that if, or when, it works, there would be significant demand and the likely result will be that there will be multiple providers offering their services."" 
In the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock fired the starting pistol in the race for ID solutions in early April, when he confirmed officials were ""looking at"" immunity passports as one route out of lockdown in a government press briefing. 
Two weeks later, Business Insider revealed London-based ID firm Yoti and German competitor IDnow had been invited to discuss the practicalities of such a scheme. 
The idea of immunity is still controversial
Yoti released its alternative to so-called immunity passports
Yoti
Following talks with government insiders, however, Yoti CEO Robin Tombs reiterated the need for caution around the word ""immunity.""
""Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how 'immune' a person is once they've recovered from this disease,"" he said.
""Our discussions with the goverment focused more on being able to tell when an individual had most recently been tested, for example, if you had negative results confirmed a day or two ago, rather than proving you're absolutely immune."" 
Yoti subsequently confirmed it had signed a preliminary agreement to provide its new solution to the Colombian soccer league, as part of an initiative to let players take part in matches behind closed doors. 
The firm went on to publish its designs for an alternative to immunity passports, a digital wallet allowing people to carry recent COVID-19 test results in their pocket, which could be presented before entering an office or boarding a flight. 
After consulting with a range of experts and academics, the firm also published a draft ""global code of practice"" for businesses offering to tie ID verification to test results. 
""Anyone who's had Yellow Fever immunity documentation will know it's a mandatory requirement for travel to certain countries,"" said Tombs. ""It was clear to us that knowing an individual's health status would be important.""
He added: ""Whilst governments are engaged, they have many issues to deal with.
""Many businesses and sports leagues, and we believe many among the general public, are thinking about how to stay safe once lockdown restrictions are lifted and people start to return to work."" 
Immunity passports could be useful one day
Onfido
Despite the lack of deep research done on COVID-19 immunity, highlighted by the WHO, the NHS, and Yoti, some companies have insisted their solutions will prove indispensable down the line. 
Husayn Kassai, CEO of ID startup Onfido, recently revealed he had been involved in talks with both the US and UK governments about the prospect of rolling out immunity passports. Speaking to Business Insider, Kassai insisted they would have a part to play in long-term exit strategies. 
""Of course, I realize we have yet to establish how long someone can be immune to the disease for,"" Kassai said. But when a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunity is eventually established, he added, the value of an immunity passport ""would increase ... not decrease"".
""Having this system in place would mean us being able to react very quickly … So if the requirements change, we can immediately revoke a user's status, and ensure they know they need to be tested again,"" he said.
For Roger Tyrzyk, UK manager of Germany's IDnow, which has also held talks with the British government, it was clear a rise in demand for identity verification would come when Hancock signaled as much at his press conference.
""We knew then that something was coming over the horizon,"" he said. ""But our approach has always been to focus on how we can help the government now, and if there is any revenue to be made later, think about that then.""
He added: ""I think some companies have tried to say 'This is how it should be done', but it's important to remember we're not health experts or scientists. We verify people's IDs and that's what we should focus on.""
IDnow is set to publish its own set of proposals for immunity passports, submitted to the UK Science and Technology Committee, within the next two weeks.
But while the future of immunity passports remains clouded, with no clear indication of who will be asked to create them, there are signs of a more collaborative than combative effort. 
Tyrzyk confirmed the firm had held talks with iDenfy and another two ID startups, which he declined to name, about how they might collaborate on a shared system across borders.
Meanwhile, Tombs confirmed to Business Insider that Yoti had entered talks with ""a small number"" of ID startups to discuss making their solutions compatible with one another. 
""We're always open to working with the right strategic partners.""

The cases and deaths are spread across roughly two farms and 189 meat and processed food factories, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network, or FERN.
The report comes amid increased attention towards the sanitation and social distancing measures taken at meat-processing facilities across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the plants-turned-hotspots are owned by major industry players like Tyson Foods, Cargill, JBS, Hormel, Conagra, and Kraft Heinz. Employers have also seen an increase in strike activity since the pandemic began, as workers demand safer conditions and higher wages. 
On Wednesday, 20 workers at a poultry plant in South Carolina walked off the job for fear of viral exposure. Since March, workers have launched protests in Georgia, California, Iowa, Nebraska, and elsewhere.
Smithfield, a meatpacking corporation, reportedly did not initially give safety masks to its workers at one Wisconsin plant. 
One worker there was told that his request for a mask was declined because the company would ""have to do it for everyone else,"" The Intercept reported.
At least 22 meatpacking and food factories have temporarily closed their doors to stem an outbreak on the shop floor, FERN reported.

Others, like a Smithfield factory in South Dakota, have recently opened up again, according to the Associated Press. 
On April 29, the top government regulator for worker safety announced it would not enforce coronavirus-related safety guidelines for the plants so long as they demonstrate ""good faith"" efforts to keep workers safe.
Employers are not required to track coronavirus cases among workers, per recent guidance, and does not require on-site inspections for worker complaints related to the virus. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, known as OSHA, said that if the ""good faith"" condition is met, the Department of Labor will consider heading off worker lawsuits against their employers.
""Likewise, the Department of Labor will consider similar requests by workers if their employer has not taken steps in good faith to follow the Joint Meat Processing Guidance,"" OSHA added in the statement.
OSHA did not say what constituted a ""good faith"" effort to comply with its guidelines. The agency didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.
Democrats and Independents slammed the ""good faith"" guidance in a letter to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia.
OSHA must ""ensure our nation's workers are meaningfully protected from COVID-19,"" said the letter, written by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
OSHA must issue emergency temporary standards, enforceable protections for workers, and general guidance to employers for protecting their workers, said the letter, which was signed by 24 other Democrats and Independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont."

Some of these businesses are adding surcharges to customers' bills to cover extra costs that are piling up as they reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""The cost of reopening includes all the extra supplies that we need and all the cleaning supplies that we need,"" Rachel Gower, owner of Houston-based Upper Hand Salon, told local ABC affiliate KTRK. The salon is adding a $3 ""sanitation charge"" to guests' checks. 
She added: ""It's worth it! It's absolutely worth it!"" 
Similarly, some dentist's offices are adding a copay to help cover the cost of personal protective equipment, a cost that the American Dental Association is working to shift to insurance companies.
Restaurants across the country faced backlash from customers earlier in May after some instituted a ""COVID-19 surcharge"" in response to rising food prices, especially for meat products that have been affected by shutdowns of processing plants.
Kiko Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Lounge in West Plains, Missouri, ultimately said it would remove surcharges and instead raise menu prices as its employees experienced harassment at the hands of frustrated customers. Photos of receipts showing the surcharge had circulated widely on social media. 
Citing a recent survey commissioned by American Express, CreditCards.com industry analyst Ted Rossman wrote that implementing a surcharge could have the unintended consequence of damaging a business' reputation and making customers feel unappreciated.
Businesses trying to keep the lights on amid the pandemic might be better off raising prices across the board, he wrote. 
""Whether we're talking COVID, health insurance, or credit cards, trying to raise revenue with an itemized surcharge is a turn-off for customers, and any short-term benefit to the merchant is greatly outweighed by the longer-term consequences of offending the people who pay the bills,"" Rossman wrote.

The company will also require that employees have their temperature checked upon arrival, wear masks, and limit their numbers in confined places like elevators, according to Bloomberg. Apple will also make modifications to its headquarters in Cupertino, California, like keeping break-room kitchens closed and reconfiguring open-office floor plans.
Apple, which was one of the first major tech companies to halt employee travel and close retail stores as the coronavirus began to spread outside of China earlier this year, has also been one of the first to start bringing employees back into the office.
In mid-May, Bloomberg reported that Apple began a phased return-to-work approach, initially allowing some hardware and software engineers to resume working out of its headquarters several days per week.
Apple, with a focus on building hardware and a secretive culture that has reportedly made it difficult for employees to work remotely, has taken a starkly different approach than rivals like Google and Facebook, which are allowing their employees to work remote until the end of 2020 (or even indefinitely if they choose, in Facebook's case).
Other companies that are charting more aggressive timelines, including Amazon, have also started building up capacity to test employees. CEO Jeff Bezos told shareholders in April that the company is aiming to test all employees, and Business Insider reported in May that the company has begun a pilot program for warehouse workers.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.

The moves are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars, the company said in a press release.
Carnival did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the percentage of its workforce that would be affected or the exact amount of money it expects to save.
""Taking these extremely difficult employee actions involving our highly dedicated workforce is a very tough thing to do. Unfortunately, it's necessary, given the current low level of guest operations and to further endure this pause,"" Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said in the statement. ""We care deeply about all our employees and understanding the impact this is having on so many strengthens our resolve to do everything we can to return to operations when the time is right.""
Earlier this week, Carnival's UK division began a process that will end in layoffs and pay cuts in the coming months. Carnival had previously reduced pay for executives and some ship-based workers, though Donald told employees at the end of March that the company didn't intend to cut its workforce through the end of June.
The global spread of COVID-19 has shut down the cruise industry since March, after the disease infected passengers and crew members on a number of ships, including the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess, Ruby Princess, and Costa Luminosa. Carnival's two biggest competitors, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, have also resorted to layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts in recent months. Norwegian said earlier in May that it had significant doubts about its ability to survive the next year.
Carnival raised $6.4 billion in debt and equity in April, and Donald said that month that the company had enough money to survive a scenario in which it earns no revenue for the rest of this year. Carnival plans to return some ships to service in August.

At the time, doctors weren't sure whether the condition — informally known as ""COVID toes"" — was an anomaly. But a growing number of coronavirus patients have displayed similar lesions over the last few months.
A Thursday editor's note in the journal JAMA Dermatology asked dermatologists to consider the link between the coronavirus and purple, swollen feet. 
""Its close temporal appearance with the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the two are associated,"" Dr. Claudia Hernandez, a dermatologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, and Dr. Anna Bruckner, a dermatologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, wrote. ""Dermatologists must be aware of the protean cutaneous findings that are possibly associated with COVID-19, even if our understanding of their origins remains incomplete.""
When doctors began observing the symptom in April, it appeared to be more common among younger, relatively healthy patients who showed few or no other symptoms. But a few Chinese studies in March identified lesions and purple toes among patients with severe infections as well. 
The lesions could be the product of general inflammation in the body or inflammation in the walls of the blood vessels — known as ""vasculitis."" They might also result from blood clots in skin vessels, or a combination of all three factors, Esther Freeman, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, previously told Business Insider. 
Despite its name, ""COVID toes"" isn't considered an official COVID-19 symptom by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much of what we know about the condition comes from a registry launched by The American Academy of Dermatology that tracks dermatological issues among coronavirus patients. Out of more than 200 submissions from healthcare providers in April, about half noted lesions on the hands or feet that resembled frostbite.
Spanish dermatologists also identified coronavirus infections in 29 out of 71 patients with purple, swollen toes in April. The doctors concluded that it was unlikely that something other than the coronavirus caused the symptom, given the timing and warm weather.
Other studies, however, have struggled to explain the phenomenon.
In a study published Thursday, doctors in Valencia, Spain, concluded that the coronavirus was not the cause of undiagnosed lesions among 20 hospitalized children in April. The patients didn't have any other coronavirus symptoms, and tested negative for both an active coronavirus infection and coronavirus antibodies. 
Another study, also published Thursday, found no evidence of coronavirus infection among 31 patients with inflamed, purple lesions in Brussels, Belgium, in April. The authors suggested that the symptoms resulted from ""lifestyle changes"" during quarantine, including more time spent in sedentary positions.
But dermatologists in Madrid found that ""COVID toes"" may occur later in the course of a coronavirus patient's illness — when that patient may no longer test positive for an active infection. On average, patients in their study developed skin lesions around nine days after their first coronavirus symptoms arrived.
For now, the link between ""COVID toes"" and coronavirus infections remains tenuous, but dermatologists stress that the association cannot be ruled out.

<li>The coronavirus pandemic threatens the future of traditional car shows as attendance dwindles and sponsorship weakens.</li>
<li>Car shows face competition as automotive manufacturers turn to the internet and off-site media previews to debut new vehic…",https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-threatens-destroy-car-shows-2020-6,https://i.insider.com/5ef2558cf0f419192301b09a?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-06-27T16:17:26Z,"Last week would have been a big week in Motown, the North American International Auto Show opening its doors to the public for the first time since abandoning its traditional winter timetable in January 2019.
The move aimed to revitalize what long was considered one of the world's most important car shows, typically drawing over 700,000 visitors through its turnstiles while, in its heyday, as many as 70 new cars, trucks, crossovers and concepts would make their debut. The last few years saw sharp declines at NAIAS, however. What was once three hectic days of product debuts shrinking to barely five hours. Sponsors had hoped a new spring timetable, allowing the show to spread to surrounding park space, would give it a kick-start. But the pandemic forced cancellation of the debut event.
The Detroit auto show isn't the only one struggling. Attendance at the Frankfurt Motor Show, once the biggest global events, was so weak last year sponsors called it their last. Now, as the coronavirus scrubs most major public events, the question is whether car shows can survive the pandemic.
""The auto show was certainly on life support already,"" said Jeff Schuster, lead auto analyst with consultancy LMC Automotive. ""With the rolling cancellation of one show after another, the coronavirus may be speeding up their demise.""
This year may see only one significant global car show, February's gathering in Chicago. Since the last-minute decision to halt the Geneva Motor Show later that month one event after another has been scrubbed, including big shows in New York and Paris, and smaller gatherings around the world. The Los Angeles Auto Show, still on the books for November, is widely expected to postpone until 2021, say numerous industry planners, though there's been no formal announcement.
The coronavirus has hit everything from baseball games to amusement parks. But it's coming at a particularly tough time for car shows already struggling with weakening public attendance and declining industry support for much of the past decade.
Attendance at the Frankfurt Auto Show peaked at 931,000 in 2015, when there were so many new models debuts organizers scheduled two simultaneous news conferences every 20 minutes for 10 hours. Last fall, public turnout was 40% lower, while manufacturers including Alfa Romeo, Bentley, Ferrari, Infiniti, Jeep, Nissan, Tesla, and a half-dozen other brands skipped out entirely.
High costs are a major factor. Even the smallest stands in New York, Paris or Los Angeles ""will come in at $1 million, bare minimum,"" said Schuster, adding it's ""easy"" to get to $10 million, especially when a carmaker brings in a big name entertainer, as Mercedes-Benz often does.
Today, however, budgets are getting squeezed, and manufacturers want ways to get more for their dollars, said Mark Wakefield, head of AlixPartners' automotive practice. There also is more competition making classic car shows ""just not as useful.""
A major reason for Detroit's move to June was the emergence of January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas as the go-to place for automakers debuting increasingly high-tech products and digital features. This year, more than a dozen staged events at CES.
Automakers are turning to places like the Texas State Fair to reveal new trucks, such as the latest-generation Chevrolet Silverado, and the annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance as a backdrop for new luxury products.
Then there's the internet which, this year has seen dozens of web debuts for products like the Honda Civic Type R, the Nissan Rogue, the Toyota Venza, Ford's F-150, and the Mercedes E-Class. 
Even when they do turn up at for traditional events like last November's Los Angeles Auto Show, many automakers have switched to off-site media previews. That not only can save money but give manufacturers more time with journalists who might otherwise have to run from one event to another every 20 minutes, explained a Volkswagen planner who asked not to be identified by name.
There's no question ""It's time for auto shows to make an adjustment,"" said Rod Alberts, executive director of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, which sponsors the NAIAS. ""If shows learn to adapt, I think they'll stay around.""
The original plans for the 2020 event called for NAIAS to spread out from the confines of Detroit's TCF Center, setting up exhibits not only on the roof of the convention hall, but in the adjoining riverfront park land, ""something we couldn't do in winter,"" said Alberts.
The DADA also was setting up an off-site event for luxury brands, like Ferrari and Rolls-Royce, that otherwise saw little value in setting up stands at TCF Center. And, rather than stick with the traditional, static displays, automakers were invited to offer potential buyers short rides in some of their news products.
Auto shows are ""becoming more focused on how to get people into dealerships,"" said David Sloan, the president of the Chicago Auto Trade Association, which sponsors that city's event.
Organizers are wont to quote data showing car shows generate sales.
""In 2019, 72% of New York Auto Show attendees said they will buy or lease a new vehicle in the next 12 months, and 36% of them added brands to their consideration lists after visiting the Show,"" stated a May release by organizers of the 120-year-old event.
But such numbers are being greeted with increasing skepticism, especially as manufacturers experiment with alternatives they feel are proving at least as effective at reaching and motivating potential buyers, said LMC Wakefield.
And the coronavirus pandemic will add impetus to a shift away from car shows, along with other large public gatherings, he said, adding that, ""We're expecting to see, post-coronavirus, a step-level change in people's comfort level with doing things online.""
Car shows won't go away entirely, Wakefield and other experts believe, but those that can't adapt to changing realities might fail, as did Frankfurt. Those that do survive are likely to be smaller, less lavish, and far more focused as they square off against others competing for the attention of potential car buyers.

The facility is one of the biggest auto-manufacturing plants in the world. The closure represented the longest it has ever experienced in its eight-plus-decade history.
In attempts not to endanger or risk the health of its hundreds of thousands or workers, the German automaker is making ""100 changes"" to the way its factories will operate as business resumes, reports CNN Business.
Production will build up gradually, according to the outlet, and follow closely to parts availability, government regulations, and car demand, which nosedived this year thanks to the pandemic. Volkswagen says it expects to build about 1,400 cars at the Wolfsburg plant this week. That number will go up to 6,000 cars next week, which is only about 40% of the plant's normal output.
Shifts will also be affected. Rather than the usual 20,000 workers, Volkswagen is restarting with one shift of 8,000 production line workers. They will see reduced hours in the beginning and changes in shifts so people coming in don't meet those exiting. 
It will be a massive undertaking. Per the story:
Workers will be expected to check their own temperature and change into their uniforms at home each morning, rather than on site. They will be asked to use elbows to open doors and walk in single file once inside, following markers on the floor to keep space between people.
Social distancing will be enforced during team meetings and over lunch breaks, with reduced seating in common areas and conference rooms converted into office spaces. Canteens will remain closed and workers asked to bring their own lunch. Water dispensers have been temporarily removed to reduce the likelihood of infection and air conditioners set to circulate as much fresh air as possible.
Tools will be disinfected after every shift and workers will no longer pass them to one another by hand, instead setting materials down in containers so that others can pick them up at a safe distance. Several hundred additional hand washing facilities are being installed throughout the plant.
There will also be more space between cars on the factory floor, with employees performing their jobs on the same car ""separately where possible."" If it isn't possible to stay five feet apart from each other, employees will need to wear masks.
Volkswagen also works with thousands of suppliers, and CNN reports it has brought over 40,000 of them up to speed on its 100-point safety plan. It notes that around 2,000 trucks would typically bring 21,000 raw materials and car parts to the Wolfsburg plant per day before the pandemic. 
With the new safety measures, delivery drivers will have to stay in their vehicles. The machines used to unload the cargo will be cleaned more often.
Volkwagen shut its Wolfsburg plant on March 18. The plant itself is among the largest in the world and covers 70 million square feet. In 2019, it produced around 700,000 cars, which breaks down to about 3,500 cars a day. It was opened in 1938 and currently employs about 63,000 people.
Ceasing production in Europe and the Americas during the pandemic reportedly cost the automaker $13 million an hour, or $2.2 billion per week.
Volkswagen did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for additional comment on the matter.

A PepsiCo representative told Business Insider that the sign has since been taken down. 
""This was an unfortunate mistake by one of our local sales associates that in trying to move with speed to get this important testing message up did not follow proper approval protocols,"" PepsiCo said in a statement. 
Massive brands, including Pepsi, have been forced to revamp their marketing practices during the coronavirus pandemic.
The company's North America chief marketing officer, Greg Lyons, told Business Insider's Tanya Dua in a recent interview that in a recent 5,000 person survey the company found 80% of respondents want brands to revise the tone or style of their advertising during the pandemic. As a result, PepsiCo pulled campaigns such as #Summergram, which showed people going outside. 
""It would be tone-deaf right now if you got a bottle of Pepsi that said 'Suns out, Buns out,'"" Lyons said. ""[We] gave some people something to feel good about — in an authentic way — because Pepsi is part of a lot of restaurant experiences and we want to help those restaurants and those employees.""

Business Insider
Above all, it is an economic experiment. The sudden stop is testing every econ department theory about global supply chains, fiscal and monetary policy, public confidence, and unemployment. Let's not let the opportunity go to waste. 
Lionized Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern yesterday recommended that New Zealand employers adopt a four-day work week. The long weekends would kickstart domestic tourism, reviving one of the most important sectors of the New Zealand economy. 
Great idea! Try it! Let's see what happens! 
The pandemic has prompted a vast array of policy experiments to protect jobs and incomes. The US has sent stimulus checks and subsidized small businesses. 
A lot of European countries are using government funds to pay furloughed workers. The US has increased unemployment pay to levels unimaginable before the crisis, and there are even conservative Republicans contemplating UBI-like income guarantees for workers. 
Almost every industry that can support working from home has switched to a working-from-home model, and some have already said they'll make it permanent. 
Work-sharing, in which employees cut hours, stay employed, and receive partial unemployment, was almost never practiced in the US before COVID-19, but now it's exploding in the 27 states that permit it. The city of Amsterdam is proposing to recover from pandemic by trying out a new, ecologically minded theory called ""doughnut economics.""
In short, the world is conducting a whole bunch of economic experiments all at once, in an effort to avert a lasting depression. It's incredibly exciting. 
Our job as citizens and our politicians' job as leaders is to learn from these experiments. As soon as the immediate crisis lifts, we'll be tempted to retreat back to our ideological hidey-holes: lower taxes, raise taxes, no deficit, don't reward laziness, etc. Let's fight that urge. 
Necessity has forced us to try policies we would have railed about three months ago. If they work--and let's hope some of them do--let's have the humility and honesty to admit it, and make them permanent.

In a decision announced April 29, the Texas General Land Office — headed by Commissioner George P. Bush, son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — rescinded the ability of local governments to prohibit beach access, the Houston Chronicle reported.
The city of Galveston, home to some of the state's most popular coastline, noted the decision in a press release, stating that beaches would reopen May 1, ""with social distancing recommendations."" Beachgoers previously risked arrest.
The reopening coincides with the expiration of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's shelter-in-place order, which is not being extended despite the spread of the coronavirus.
On April 28, Texas reported 42 new fatalities from COVID-19 — up from 26 a week before and 11 at the start of the month. Overall, at least 732 people have died from the coronavirus in the Lone Star State, which has confirmed just over 27,000 cases of the disease caused by the virus.
Texas' Republican leaders have long chafed against social distancing requirements. In March, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick suggested in an interview with Fox News that older people, who are at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, should accept the greater risk of mortality that comes with returning to business as usual.
""What I'm living in fear of is what's happening to this country,"" Patrick said. ""No one reached out to me and said, as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?

But, owners say they are simply trying to stay in business as food costs skyrocket. 
Earlier this week, a tweet showing the receipt from Kiko Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Lounge in West Plains, Missouri, went viral after a customer noticed a ""COVID-19 surcharge."" Many responded with outrage, questioning why the coronavirus pandemic would lead to the restaurant adding on a 5% surcharge. 
—Talia (@talialikeitis) May 11, 2020
According to a post on Kiko's Facebook page, the outrage continued off-line. The restaurant owner wrote that employees had been harassed due to the photo of the receipt.  
""Please understand we are not doing this to take advantage of you guys!"" the post reads. ""We are doing this hoping we can adjust the surcharge weekly rather than just raise all of our prices on our menu due to increase prices from our supplier on meat, poultry, seafood &amp; produce.""
The post questioned why people were harassing Kiko workers when meat suppliers had raised prices due to the ""broken"" meat supply chain.
Meat plants have been forced to close due to COVID-19 outbreaks in recent weeks, causing prices to skyrocket. Fresh meat prices were up 8.1% at the end of April, and experts say prices could increase by an unprecedented 20% in the coming months. 
Kiko announced it would remove the surcharge, instead raising prices on all menu items. 
West Plains local news station KY3 reported that two other local restaurants, Ozark Cafe and Bootleggers BBQ, had also added 5% surcharges. While many customers told KY3 they were happy to pay, Buffalo BBQ announced earlier this week it was dropping the surcharge, instead choosing to raise prices. 
""We appreciate all of your support and understanding during this very unusual trying times!"" the restaurant posted on Facebook. ""Please remember we are all human, treat each other with decency and respect, and let's try to get along and get through this together!""
Purple Cow, a diner in Kingsport, Tennessee, also ended a surcharge on beef prices this week ""due to confusion."" After a burst of angry Facebook comments, the restaurant announced it would instead change the prices on individual menu items, apologizing for any inconvenience. 
Goog's Pub and Grub in Holland, Michigan wrote on Facebook that it has seen remarkable support since adding a $1 ""COVID charge,"" to counteract sky-rocketing beef prices. An Instagram photo, spotted by NBC's Today show, appears to show a $1 carne asada surcharge at Ramberto's in San Diego.

Walmart's testing approach could include diagnostic tests to confirm COVID-19 infections in employees, as well as antibody testing to determine whether employees had ever contracted the illness.
""We're pursuing strategies in testing associates for the virus, including in the longer term, antibody testing,"" McMillon said during a call with analysts. 
He said Walmart has a team dedicated to determining its testing approach. 
""We've got a team involved in trying to sort out what kind of testing approach we're going to take, both diagnostic and antibody testing, as we all try to keep people safe,"" he said. 
Widespread testing could be costly for Walmart, which has more than 2.2 million employees worldwide, including more than 1.5 million in the US. 
Amazon has said it expects to spend $1 billion in 2020 to develop employee testing. The company is developing a testing lab and assembled a team of researchers, engineers, and procurement specialists dedicated to building its testing capacity. 
Amazon has also said it plans to spend at least $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses.
""Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we'd expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said this month. ""But these aren't normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on COVID-related expenses getting products to customers and keeping employees safe.""
In response to an analyst's question about Amazon's testing cost estimates, McMillon said, ""Some of those investment numbers that have been mentioned I think anticipate paying per test a fairly high number for a lot of people and a lot of tests. That's one of the areas that we are looking at.""
He didn't provide specifics on testing costs for Walmart.
Walmart said it spent about $900 million in coronavirus-related costs in the first quarter, and that most of that investment was spent on employee bonuses and expanded benefits. 
Walmart has announced two rounds of pandemic-related bonuses for its US hourly employees, which collectively cost the company about $755 million. Walmart has also hired more than 235,000 additional US workers since March."

The drug is part of the ""Solidarity"" international clinical trial sponsored by the WHO in 17 countries, with others expressing interest. Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan explained that the trial is overseen by a board of experts and an independent data safety monitor. The steering committee met over the weekend and decided in light of uncertainty about the drug, that they should ""err on the side of caution and suspend enrollment into the hydroxychloroquine arm"" of the trial, Dr. Swaminathan said. 
The new plan is for the board to look into data from the trial so far, and continue to gather evidence on efficacy and safety of the drug. Dr. Swaminathan emphasized the importance of continued well-conducted studies in large enough numbers to reliably answer those questions. The WHO wants to use hydroxychloroquine if it reduces mortality rates and lengths of hospital stays, she said. 
Officials in the press conference clarified that this is only a temporary measure, and the board will meet again in about two weeks to review the data. The process is standard practice, and if no danger is found randomized use will continue, Executive Director Dr. Michael Ryan said.

Hydroxychloroquine, which was approved the FDA in 1955, has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and malaria.
Last week, President Trump announced that he's taking the drug every day to possibly prevent COVID-19. In a letter, Trump's doctor said ""the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks."" The FDA says the general public shouldn't take the drug to treat or prevent COVID-19 outside of hospitals or monitored trials, because it can interact with common medications and cause irregular hearth rhythms. 
In the largest study so far on hydroxychloroquine 's effectiveness at treating COVID-19, patients who received the medication had a higher risk of death than those who did not. The study of more than 96,000 hospitalized patients was published in the journal The Lancet, and the study's authors couldn't find any noticeable benefits from the medication. The study wasn't definitive, though — it was observational, rather than a randomized controlled trial.

But scientists believe that they can confidently say that the virus wasn't created by humans and the myth going around is nothing more than that, a myth. So how do they know with such certainty? The key is in the virus's genetic code. This is the genomic sequence for SARS-CoV-2.
It was decoded in January 2020, just weeks after the world started to learn of this novel coronavirus. Each of those letters is a genetic building block known as a nucleotide, and when built up, they form an organism's genetic code, which we can use to understand them. Each organism has a different code and a varying amount of nucleotides. A human has about three billion of them, whereas a virus, such as SARS-CoV-2 has about 30,000. Your genetic sequence can give information about your hair, eye color, sex, and lineage. And just like your genes give clues about who and where you come from, scientists can use a virus genome sequence to help explain where that virus originated as well. An ancestry test for viruses, if you will.
Robert Garry: We honed in on the parts of the virus that we thought were unique and that might play a role in the evolution of the virus, but also in the pathogenesis of it. And a couple of things stood out pretty quickly when we starting to compare with the other coronaviruses that have come before.
Narrator: That's Robert Garry, a professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Tulane University. Along with his colleagues, he used the virus sequence to try and understand where SARS-CoV-2 came from. They first looked at the virus's backbone. That's the whole genomic structure, unique to each virus, like a viral template. Simplified, the backbone for SARS-CoV-2 and its 30,000 nucleotides looks a little bit like this.
Each section is responsible for a part of the virus. For example, this one is responsible for the spike proteins you may have seen lining the virus shell. So it may not come as a surprise that to engineer a virus in a lab, you would need to start with a backbone. But to manufacture from scratch the backbone of a virus that can also cause disease is almost impossible.
Garry: I mean, people just don't know enough about what makes a virus pathogenic to be able to assemble that. How you pick amongst all the possibilities to get to that last little bit that's gonna turn it into this worldwide pathogen, which sequences do you think about to put in there?
Narrator: Simply, there is just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation, like SARS-CoV-2 has. So creating a new, deadly backbone is pretty much impossible. But there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab, and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point.
With a recycled backbone, two main methods could have been used to create the new virus. They could've either quickly mutated it, or added and deleted parts of the existing virus. But additions and deletions in a virus leave a trace that can be pointed out pretty quickly, a little bit like removing a red brick from a wall and replacing it with a black brick. This is exactly what Maciej Boni, an associate professor at Penn State, looked for.
Maciej Boni: You might see an insertion that looks unusual, and you look out in nature and you see that no other viruses have genetic insertions like that. We did not see any genetic insertions that are not also identified in nature. So there's no evidence suggesting that it was manmade or laboratory created somehow.
Narrator: So what if they went with the other option and mutated an existing virus? This is known as serial passage and acts in a similar way to selective breeding. Scientists are able to mimic evolution, to a degree. By forcing the virus to mutate over and over again into a potentially different form. This can be used to weaken a virus, which is how some vaccines have been made, or to strengthen a virus, say, by making it more transmissible.
But for this to work, the existing virus would have to show significant genetic similarity to the new virus. In fact, they would have to be almost identical. Because this process only speeds up viral evolution and has a limit, it's not possible to direct mutations into a completely different form. Yet Garry and his team found that the backbone for SARS-CoV-2 was strictly unique, differing significantly from other coronaviruses.
For example, SARS-CoV, the first SARS, has only about a 79% genetic sequence match to SARS-CoV-2. So it's ruled out. The best candidate is RaTG13, a bat coronavirus with a 96% gene sequence similarity.
Garry: Now, 96% sounds pretty close, but in genetic terms, that's actually a pretty long ways away.
Narrator: To put it in perspective, humans and chimpanzees share 99% of the same genome. And you may have noticed there's still a large difference between the two. For SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, that 4% is the difference of about 800 nucleotides, or about 50 years of natural evolution.
Garry: 800 is too big a barrier. You have something that was 99.5% or 99.7% similar, maybe only 20 or 30 nucleotides, you might get away with it, you might be able to manufacture that, doing it in the lab.
Narrator: But it just wouldn't be possible with current knowledge and existing viruses. There's also another part of the gene sequence that helped Garry and his colleagues learn about the natural origins of SARS CoV-2. In particular, this set of nucleotides in the gene sequence. You might remember those from earlier. They're responsible for the virus spike proteins, the pointy, claw-like arms lining the outside of the virus that give it its distinctive appearance, and coronaviruses their name.
Specific viruses, including coronaviruses, use these arms to enter and take over host cells. But this piece of the spike protein helped tell the researchers that this virus originated in nature. This set of nucleotides relates to the receptor binding domain, or RBD. That's the part that latches on to the receptors on targeted cells. As viruses can only survive when inside other cells, this is a vital section that you would have to focus on if you were to make a virus in a lab. Garry and his team found the RBD has evolved specifically to bind to the human cell ACE2, a receptor usually used to help regulate blood pressure.
But it's the way it so successfully binds to the ACE2 receptor that is crucial. You see, when a scientist tests what aspects would make a virus more potent, they run models through computer simulations. But when researchers put this sequence through those simulations, they found that SARS-CoV-2's RBD shouldn't be successful at all and would actually cause poor efficiency in transmission, which we know is not the case.
Garry: Yeah, by working in the lab or working with the computer, trying to figure it out, we just would not have come up with this particular way to have this virus bind to this receptor, a very important part of the whole replication process.
Narrator: In other words, if your goal was to make a virus to infect humans, you wouldn't have chosen this one.
Garry: Basically, what nature has done is come up with a solution for binding that is better than any computer and also way better than what any scientist could come up with.
Narrator: So we know why scientists confidently say SARS-CoV-2 wasn't made in a lab, but that's not the end of the story. It's also been rumored that SARS-CoV-2 was a known virus that was accidentally leaked from a lab. Now, we can't say for certain this isn't the case, but it's highly unlikely. For one, this virus wasn't sequenced before January 2020. And if it was, the world would know because the Wuhan Institute of Virology was specifically looking for something like this in order to protect the world from any outbreaks.
Garry: If they would have come up with a SARS coronavirus that was 76% similar to the original SARS one. I mean, they would have published that as fast as they could. That would have been, at least in the scientific world, very big news.
Narrator: But it's also just statistically highly unlikely.
Garry: So just out in nature there, literally billions of people that are having millions of encounters with these animals. And, you know, we're talking about a handful, a few dozen, maybe, in the whole world are scientists that go out and trap bats. So just on the odds of the thing, it's just a minuscule chance that it was this one scientist that accidentally infected himself in this very sophisticated laboratory setting.
Narrator: So SARS-CoV-2's origin is no longer a mystery. But where and how it jumped in nature, well, that's a question many are still trying to answer.

<li>Small businesses have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown, but planning thoughtful messaging will help them stay connected with customers as the country is slowly opening up.</li>

More than 100,000 small businesses have permanently closed since the beginning of the shutdown, according to a recent study.
As states around the country begin the road to reopening, the good news for small businesses is that consumers ""will want to spend money on brands that they have been loyal to in the past and those that define their neighborhood or culture,"" says Sloane Humphrey, president and CEO of Powell Communications, a New York corporate public relations firm.
Consumers are open to receiving marketing messages from businesses, but they also want to know which efforts companies are taking to address COVID-19. ""Consumers aren't going to penalize businesses for marketing,"" says Kelty Logan, an associate professor at the College of Media, Communication, and Information at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""But they want evidence that businesses are doing the right thing and taking care of their people and taking care of us.""
Small businesses should feel comfortable reaching out to their customers and the larger community through email and social media — but they need to be thoughtful with their messaging to avoid alienating people during an unusually sensitive time. 
Here are some ways small businesses can effectively reach out to their customers in this new post-COVID-19 world. 
Use the right language
The most important thing to remember when crafting marketing messages during, and even following, a crisis is to strike the right tone. Customers want to hear how you're navigating the crisis, but they are also sensitive to any sign that you are attempting to exploit or profit from it. 
Proactive business move: For now, put overt sales messages aside and strive for an even, reassuring, and optimistic tone. If you've reopened, it's okay to send an email with a celebratory subject line like ""We're back!"" or ""Open for business!"" Then, use the body of the email to carefully explain what precautions you've taken: ""For now, we will be limiting in-store capacity to four customers at a time,"" or ""we are offering curbside pickup: here's how it works."" The key is to make sure you are giving customers the information they need to feel safe patronizing your business. 
In your first communications with customers, avoid overly pushy sales language, like a subject line advertising ""Big savings!"" But if you are running a sale or specials, it's fine to include those in the body. For example: ""To welcome you back, we are offering 30% off special items throughout the store."" 
Spread the word
If your company temporarily closed during the shutdown, it's important to let customers know that you've opened up again. Now, more than ever, letting people know that you're a part of their community and eager to provide a service could entice first-timers to give you a try. 
Proactive business move: Small businesses should consider implementing an email marketing program to remind customers that they are open for business — and to help identify new patrons. Square's email marketing tool allows you to design, send, and measure email campaigns quickly. 
When starting an email campaign, be mindful of how frequently you hit send. Emailing too often could annoy recipients, while emailing too infrequently could weaken your results. The rule of thumb is to respect your customer's inbox and email only when you have something to say. If your emails are always useful and informative, you will find customers much more eager to engage with them.
Offer reassurance
As Americans emerge from their homes, lingering fears of virus transmission will help determine where they choose to spend their time and money. All companies — particularly those with a physical location that is open to the public — need to let customers know which steps they are taking to keep them and their employees safe. 
Proactive business move: Use your social feeds and email communications to explain your new health and safety procedures. If you've recently implemented a contactless purchase system, like the one Square provides, advertise that your business has taken proactive steps to make your customer's experience more comfortable for them. Don't be afraid to share those messages widely, as they have an impact far beyond your customers.
Be social
In general, small businesses should be communicating regularly via their social feeds during this time, Humphrey says. ""Frequent updates via social media will be mission-critical,"" she says. That means friendly reminders like, ""we're still here"" and ""things will be different, but we're the same brand you remember."" It's a great way to let customers know you're open for business and be sure they keep your company top of mind as they venture out.
Proactive business move: When developing a social media content plan, it's best to think in terms of themes. For example, you could try to fit each of your posts into one of the following themes
<ul><li>Brand education: The basics about your business and what people need to know to do business with you.</li><li>Updates and announcements: Notes about new products or locations, expanded (or reduced) hours, and major staff changes. </li><li>Behind-the-scenes access: Photos or videos that give your customers a sneak peek into what makes your company unique. </li><li>Social good: Let your customers know about any charity or community work you or your staff are doing.</li><li>Redeemable offers: Coupon codes, limited-time offers, free shipping. </li></ul>Reward loyalty
If you haven't already, now is a great time for small businesses to start a customer-loyalty program, which can drive a sense of belonging among everyone who does business with you. They can also ensure deeper engagement with walk-in customers. 
Loyalty programs are a proven way to retain customers, and studies show that existing customers are far more likely to buy from your business than potential customers. The cost of retaining customers is also a fraction of what it costs to acquire new ones.    
Proactive business move: If you're starting a loyalty program for the first time, be sure to let your customers know about it through email and on social media. Make sure that your program offers rewards that your customers want and a path to getting them that is easy enough (but not too easy) and fairly quick.
Walk the walk
In times of crisis, consumers look to local businesses to do their part. If you've donated any money, goods, or services to COVID-19 relief causes, don't be afraid to let your community know about it. You should share even small measures that you've taken. Consumers don't expect local shops to make large-scale contributions. They just want to see your values in action.
As challenging as the coming months could be, they present a unique opportunity for small businesses to come out stronger than ever. By effectively communicating their value and commitment to the community, companies can help customers — and themselves —  more rapidly adjust to the new normal. The trick is to walk the walk and show consumers you have them in mind every step of the way.

Paul Monies, a reporter with the nonprofit news outlet Oklahoma Watch, revealed on Friday that he tested positive despite not yet showing any symptoms. He took the test as a precaution after attending the rally.
Two Trump campaign staffers who were at the event have also tested positive, joining a half-dozen others on the advance team for the rally who contracted the virus before the event — including two members of the Secret Service.
""I'm pretty surprised,"" Monies posted on Twitter. ""I have zero symptoms (so far) and I feel fine. In fact, I ran 5 miles this morning.""
""I spent the last few hours calling people I know I've been in contact with in the last 14 days,"" he added.

""COVID is here in Tulsa,"" he said. ""It is transmitting very efficiently.""
Keaton Ross, another reporter at Oklahoma Watch, said that both he and his colleague were wearing masks at the rally. But ""it was very difficult to avoid large crowds, especially as we left the arena,"" he noted.
Ross said he was going to get tested and was ""bracing for a positive result.""
It's ""scary to think there are thousands of people like me (likely positive but feel fine) who are out and about,"" Ross added.

Cars are a seemingly perfect mobility solution during the COVID-19 pandemic; they help us maintain social distancing while also giving us a closed-off space to inhabit.
But what about convertibles? Yes — they, too, are perfectly safe to use during the pandemic. 
Perhaps it is the open-topness of a convertible that is giving people pause but rest assured that just because a car lacks a roof, it doesn't mean it exposes you to the virus any more than a hardtop car would.
As long as the inside of the car — which is what you come in closest contact with — hasn't been exposed to someone with COVID-19, it's perfectly safe to drive. The virus can't suddenly enter the car just because the top is down.
""A convertible doesn't present any great risks,"" Paula Cannon, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, confirmed to Business Insider. 
One extreme hypothetical situation that Cannon outlines is if a convertible driver suddenly finds themselves stationary in a crowd and people are within six feet of the car (like perhaps if you get caught in a busy crosswalk or some sort of march).
""That would be the same risk as if you were standing in that same crowd,"" Cannon says. ""So, I suggest you don't do that.""
The chances of that happening while driving a convertible, however, are pretty low. And if it did, occupants are welcome to simply put the top up until the hazard has passed. Or, they could avoid places with frequent stops near high-pedestrian traffic areas altogether.
The actual risk comes more from who's in the car, not who's outside of it. Be thoughtful about who is in the car with you, Cannon advises. In fact, given a situation, it may indeed be more beneficial to have the top down when driving with others. ""Certainly, having the top down makes it safer than being in an enclosed cabin,"" she says.
But despite discussing convertibles, Cannon's advice seems more applicable toward sharing cars in general.
If you are driving the car after someone else, for example, she recommends wiping down common touch points, such as the steering wheel, door handles, buttons, keys, window controls, climate vents, and gear selector lever to make sure everything is safe. It's also a good idea to wipe the car down after you yourself are done driving and intend on letting someone else drive. 
""Again, the safest strategy is to be a little bit selfish,"" Cannon says. ""Personally, it would be only in my own car, or with the people I am socially distancing with, or with a very small and select group of friends or family who I trust to also be socially distancing."" 
The most ideal situation for every individual — or self-isolating group — is to stay in their own cars, she says.

The Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy’s health, is also expected to show the number of people on jobless benefits hitting a new record high in mid-May. 
The report is being watched to assess how quickly the economy rebounds after businesses shuttered in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19 and almost ground the country to a halt. While non-essential businesses are starting to reopen, claims have stayed at astonishingly high levels. 
“I am concerned that we are seeing a second round of private sector layoffs that, coupled with a rising number of public sector cut backs is driving up the number of people unemployed,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
“If that is the case, given the pace of reopening, we could be in for an extended period of extraordinary high unemployment. And that means the recovery will be slower and will take a lot longer.”  
The number of people filing new claims for state unemployment benefits likely totaled a seasonally adjusted 2.1 million for the week ended May 23, down from 2.438 million the prior week, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
The number has fallen steadily since hitting a record 6.867 million in late March, but have not registered below 2 million since mid-March. State governors have requested $500 billion to help cover public health expenses and lost tax revenues, underscoring the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the economy. 
The Commerce Department is expected to confirm in another report on Thursday that gross domestic product contracted at a 4.8% annualize rate in the first quarter, the deepest decline in output since the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
The second wave of layoffs could grow bigger, with Boeing (BA.N) announcing on Wednesday it was eliminating more than 12,000 U.S. jobs and also disclosing it planned “several thousand remaining layoffs” in the next few months. 
The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book on Wednesday, comprising anecdotal information on business activity from contacts nationwide on or before May 18, was equally grim. Its depiction of the labor market said “employment continued to decrease in all districts” and “continued to fall sharply in retail and in leisure and hospitality sectors.” 
In addition to the spill over to segments of the economy not initially impacted by the closure of nonessential businesses, some economists said initial claims were staying elevated also because of backlogs from the flood of applications that overwhelmed state unemployment offices. 
But this was dismissed by many who argued these backlogs should have been eliminated by now. 
CLAIMS MISREPORTED? 
There is also belief that state employment offices are combining filings for the federal government’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program with regular jobless claims instead of separating them as required by the Labor Department. 
The PUA program is for gig workers and many others who do not qualify for regular unemployment insurance. They, however, must first file for state benefits and be denied in order to get federal aid for coronavirus-related job and income losses. 
Last week’s filings would raise the number of people who filed claims for unemployment benefits to above 40 million since March 21. Economists cautioned this figure does not represent the number of jobs lost due to the pandemic, citing technical difficulties and procedures at state unemployment offices. 
The focus should be on the number of people still receiving unemployment benefits. These so-called continuing claims could shed light on the effectiveness of the government’s Paycheck Protection Program. 
The PPP, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, offered businesses loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. 
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, likely increased to a record 25.750 million in the week ending May 16 from 25.073 million in the prior week, according to the Reuters survey. This data will cover the period during which the government surveyed households for May’s unemployment rate. 
Based on the forecast, continuing claims increased roughly by 7.7 million between the April and May survey periods, suggesting a surge in the unemployment rate from last month’s post-World War Two record of 14.7%. 
“Now is a good time to think how many of those people who lost their jobs are going to get them back, my sense is 25% will not and that’s what gives us the double digit unemployment rate well into 2021,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. “The bankruptcies of small and medium enterprises will result in a much higher rate of permanent layoffs.”

The museum can usually attract up to 15,000 visitors a day during the summer months, but with France’s borders still closed to many foreign tourists and with social distancing in place, its daily capacity has now been cut to 5,000. 
“The crisis has hit the cultural world very hard. Our revenue shortfall will be significant. We are in a complex situation with a very tough period to navigate in 2020-21,” said museum head Laurence des Cars. 
“We are hoping for special support from the state.” 
Ticket sales make up 70% of the Orsay’s revenue, and foreign tourists account for 70% of all visitors during the summer. 
Visitors are now asked to book tickets online, to wear protective face masks and observe social distancing rules. 
Orsay, a former railway station on the left bank of the Seine river, houses the world’s largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. 
Access to the entrance and exit is signposted, but circulation within the collection and exhibitions remains free. 
The French government began easing its lockdown measures from mid-May and cultural venues are slowly reopening. The Palace of Versailles reopened on June 6 and the Louvre museum will welcome back visitors from July 6. 
Visitors wandering around the Orsay’s permanent collections and a new retrospective of French artist James Tissot on Tuesday were delighted that the museum had reopened. 
“I was happy and emotional (on learning of the reopening), and the proof is that I’m here on the first day,” said Yvette, an 80-year-old Parisian.

With public support for low-carbon shifts growing and the state spending billions to boost its flagging economy, now is “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to ramp up the transition, said John Gummer, chair of Britain’s Committee on Climate Change. 
“If we are to emerge successfully from COVID-19, there is only one route and that route is one that enables us also to fight climate change,” said the head of the independent advisory body, which released its annual progress report on Thursday. 
That document said Britain was moving toward its commitment, made a year ago, to produce no more emissions than it can offset or store by 2050 - but steps so far “do not yet measure up to the size of the net-zero challenge”. 
To speed up action, the government should use the coronavirus crisis - including fresh public concern about unexpected risks and willingness to change behaviour - to push ahead on new climate-smart policies, the report said. 
Those should include retrofitting homes and buildings to make them more energy-efficient, which would provide work in all regions, it noted, as well as strengthening the electricity supply network to support increased use of renewable power. 
The country’s emerging electric-vehicle charging network should be rapidly expanded, and only new vehicles that are zero emissions sold by 2032, it said. Work on flood defences, as climate risks rise, should also be brought forward, it urged. 
Efforts to train workers for low-carbon jobs, to ensure a fair green transition, should be a priority, along with protecting nature through more forest protection and tree planting, and better managing agricultural land, it added. 
Even improving Britain’s broadband network - to enable more people to work at home - could have big climate benefits, said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. 
And hiking fossil fuel taxes now while oil prices are low could raise $15 billion over the next decade in badly needed new tax revenue - and help push people towards low-carbon alternatives, he said. 
“We are not short of ideas of what can be done here,” Stark told an online briefing, noting many of the proposed changes “stack up on straight economic grounds” as well as making sense for climate action. 
Renewable power - in large part from offshore wind - is now the cheapest electricity option in Britain, he said, one reason the country’s emissions dropped by more than 3% last year even as global emissions continued to rise. 
With Britain moving to the final stage of leaving the European Union at the end of 2020, clean power could be one pillar of its new post-Brexit identity, he said. 
“We’re almost at the point where you can envision an energy system based on renewables, especially wind, and no one blinks when you say it. It’s absolutely amazing,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. 
‘WIN-WIN’ 
Adair Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a New York-based think-tank, said government spending on things from renewable energy to home retrofits and tree planting could quickly create jobs while curbing emissions. 
“This is a clear win-win opportunity which must be seized,” he said in a statement. 
Camilla Toulmin, a senior associate with the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, said Britain - host of the delayed COP26 U.N. climate talks - could not afford “a slowdown or delay to climate action in 2020”. 
Climate impacts are being felt both abroad and in Britain, she said in a statement, noting that despite the global pandemic “the climate crisis has not stopped”. 
Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said some of its members planned to protest on Thursday at the Treasury in London against what they saw as “criminal inaction” by the government so far toward achieving its net-zero goal. 
That goal was enshrined in law last year following large-scale street protests and other civil disobedience by the grassroots movement and other climate campaign groups. 
The Committee on Climate Change report draws on recommendations made by the Climate Assembly UK, a citizen panel set up by several parliamentary committees with members selected to reflect the demographics of Britain’s diverse population. 
Nearly 80% of the assembly’s 108 members agreed in a secret ballot that government steps to boost the economy after COVID-19 should be designed to help achieve Britain’s net-zero target. 
And almost all - 93% - agreed that, as the virus lockdown eases, the state, employers and others should encourage shifts in lifestyles to become more compatible with reaching net-zero. 
Gummer said Committee on Climate Change members hoped the government would rapidly turn many of their recommendations into policy that is then quickly put into practice. 
“What we don’t want from the government is a lot of good-hearted statements (and) the beginnings of policies that are not being implemented,” he said. 
Changes in the law often take several years to take effect, but with climate threats surging and the country’s zero-carbon deadline drawing closer, “we haven’t got five years”, he said.

The June 22-23 poll also found that a majority of Americans want Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, to testify to Congress under oath, after he accused Trump in a new book of misdeeds, including seeking Chinese President Xi Jinping’s help to win re-election. 
The poll shows that 37% of Americans approved of the way Trump has responded to the pandemic, the lowest on record since Reuters/Ipsos started asking the question at the beginning of March. Fifty-eight percent said they disapproved. 
With a little over four months to go before the Nov. 3 general election, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, leads Trump by 10 percentage points among registered voters, according to the latest poll, down slightly from a 13-point lead in a similar poll last week. 
Trump has been slow to publicly acknowledge the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 120,000 Americans so far, and he has pushed states to reopen before experts said it was safe to do so. 
In his first post-pandemic rally, held in Oklahoma on Saturday, the president told thousands of supporters that testing was a “double-edged sword” and that he asked health officials to slow down testing in response to the public’s concern for the growing number of cases. 
Administration officials said Tuesday that Trump did not, in fact, ask them to slow down testing, which is one way to track and eventually control the spread of the disease. 
Cases have jumped by 25% nationally, according to the latest seven-day tally, led by spikes in a number of states such as Texas, Arizona and Florida that have been more lenient about social distancing. 
Trump has steadily bled support among a broad swath of voters since March. Americans are increasingly critical of his response to the pandemic and a wave of protests in the aftermath of the May 25 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis. 
Members of Trump’s Republican Party also appeared to be more pessimistic than at any other time during his presidency. Just 43% said they thought the country was headed in the “right direction,” the lowest level recorded by the Reuters/Ipsos poll since Trump entered office in January 2017. 
Trump has faced an unusual outpouring of criticism from members of the military establishment such as James Mattis, his first defense secretary, over his militarized response to the protests. Most recently, Bolton said Trump was unfit to be president and accused him in his new book of routinely obstructing justice. 
Fifty-eight percent of Americans - 81% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans - said they would like to see Bolton testify under oath about his experiences in the Trump administration. 
Bolton, who refused to do so last year as part of the House of Representatives’ impeachment proceedings against Trump, appeared to confirm one of the investigation’s central allegations in his book, saying that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, as a condition to receiving U.S. security aid. 
However, Americans appear to be less interested in another protracted impeachment investigation, so close to the election. Forty-one percent said they wanted Congress to open another inquiry into Trump, while 39% said they were opposed, and 20% said they were “not sure.” 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,115 adults, including 503 Democrats and 408 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points.

FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Adria Tour - Novak Tennis Centre, Belgrade, Serbia - June 12, 2020 Serbia's Viktor Troicki, Nenad Zimonjic, Dusan Lajovic, Novak Djokovic, Austria's Dominic Thiem, Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov and Germany's Alexander Zverev pose for a photo with the ballkids, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) REUTERS/Marko Djurica/File Photo
As a cautionary tale, it could hardly be more stark. 
For while the images from the Adria Tour exhibition tournament in Serbia and Croatia were no doubt a fillip for some fans starved of top-flight tennis action, the organisers also tempted fate with the lack of precautions. 
Though the players were not breaking government protocols during the tournament, which was organised by Djokovic, it highlighted the risks of athletes from different countries mingling without adhering to what have become social distancing norms. 
    Few were, therefore, surprised when Djokovic contracted the virus with Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Croatia’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki having already tested positive after playing in his Balkan event. 
Hindsight offers clarity, but organisers of the world’s biggest tournaments say they will not make the same mistakes as they reopen the sport and seek to keep the players safe. 
“There were a fair few learnings that have come out of that (Adria Tour),” Tennis Australia’s (TA) Chief Operating Officer Tom Larner told Reuters. 
“And whilst, certainly the whole event was actually really well-intentioned in terms of raising money for charity, the execution was clearly not great, as were the processes in place.” 
Australia had successfully curbed the virus spread but a double-digit increase in new cases recently has triggered fear of another wave due to apparent community transmission. 
TA gave a glimpse of the biosecurity protocols that could be in place for next year’s Australian Open while announcing measures for the domestic UTR Pro Tennis Series, which will be played at closed stadiums. 
Players would have to bring their own towels and will be encouraged to shower off-site. On-court personnel would be limited to an umpire, minimal line judges with no ball-kids. 
NO SPECTATORS 
First up, though, will be the U.S. Open, scheduled to be held in New York from Aug. 31. Organisers have come under fire, including from Djokovic, who initially called their measures “extreme”. They will now feel vindicated. 
    “This situation is exactly why we have created a comprehensive health and medical plan... that was approved by New York State,” USTA spokesman Chris Widmaier told Reuters. 
    “The creation of a controlled U.S. Open environment, including official hotels, transportation, food, medical and safety protocols, enables us to mitigate potential risk, and appropriately respond to any issues.” 
    The U.S. Open will have no spectators, there will be limitations on players’ entourage and everyone must wear masks when onsite unless practising or competing. Testing will be conducted before travelling to the United States and at least once per week along with daily temperature checks. 
    New York City has witnessed an easing of lockdown restrictions in recent days but residents have been asked to follow social distancing norms and cover faces in public. 
    Restaurants and bars began offering outdoor service and many retailers started to allow patrons back into their stores. 
    Serbia introduced a state of emergency soon after the pandemic broke out, including daily curfews for 12 hours, but gradual easing of measures saw 25,000 fans flock to a soccer derby between Belgrade rivals Red Star and Partizan on June 10. 
    A sellout crowd of 4,000 attended both days of the Belgrade leg of Djokovic’s tournament, staged at his tennis centre by the Danube River. 
    Croatia, where the tournament’s second leg was held in Zadar, still had social distancing norms in place and the Visnjik tennis complex, with a capacity of 9,000, hosted half as many spectators. 
    It did not stop Djokovic and his fellow players from playing basketball there, images of which were jarring to many as the majority of the world continued to battle the virus. 
    Djokovic, who heads the players council of the men’s ATP Tour, said he was wrong and “deeply sorry”.

Outbreaks of coronavirus infections have killed three people and infected hundreds more on farms in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, in recent weeks. 
Health Minister Patty Hajdu said she had heard stories about the treatment of migrant workers that “would curl your hair,” and the way some farms treat them now is “a national disgrace.” 
Hajdu added that she was working with Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough “on how to reform the temporary foreign worker program” but gave no details on what those reforms might look like. 
Canadian farmers rely on some 60,000 temporary foreign workers, predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean to plant and harvest crops. Many live in crowded bunkhouses where the virus can spread quickly. 
“All the PPE (personal protective equipment) in the world will not protect you if you are sleeping in a bunkhouse that is housing 12 to 15 people that may not have any ability for distancing, certainly no private washrooms or kitchen,” Hajdu said when asked whether Canada would consider providing migrant workers with PPE upon their arrival in Canada. 
Migrant farm workers are considered a vulnerable population and need to be supported should they fall ill, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam told reporters on Thursday. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said Canada must do more to protect migrant farm workers, who are considered essential workers. 
Earlier this week, an Ontario official said the province would allow some people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but do not have symptoms to immediately return to work, provided precautions were in place.

The shutdowns enacted to control the virus disproportionately hit hospitality, education, health and retail, and it will take a while for the economy to recover fully, George said in remarks prepared for a virtual event organized by the Economic Club of Kansas City. 
“While we saw strong job gains in these industries in May, with employment increasing by 2 million jobs, a full recovery is still far off,” she said. 
The Fed’s efforts to boost market liquidity and improve market functioning through asset purchases and a slate of emergency lending facilities seem to have worked, George said. But economic activity may not fully rebound, and the possibility of a new surge of infections is likely to remain a “persistent risk” until a vaccine is developed, she cautioned. 
State and local governments, in particular, are struggling to balance their budgets after the pandemic led to a sharp drop in tax revenues, she said. 
Given the uncertainty over the outlook, it will be difficult for policymakers to determine the correct path for monetary policy, George said. 
“Overall, it might be a while before the dust settles and we gain insight on whether further accommodation is necessary or not,” she said.

* Sovereign wealth funds investing more at home 
* Trend to quicken after economic rout

By Tom Arnold 
LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Famed for snapping up glitzy real estate and stakes in troubled international banks during the global financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds are investing more at home, a trend set to accelerate in the wake of the economic carnage wrought by COVID-19. 
Some of these state-owned entities, such as Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, already acted more as development funds aimed at supporting their countries’ economies, but many of them are considered “rainy day” funds - meaning they will have a big role in helping governments to manage the fallout from the pandemic. 
There has been a flurry of recent domestic deals, such as Turkey’s fund injecting 21 billion lira ($3.1 billion) into three state banks and Temasek supporting a $1.5 billion rights issue by Sembcorp Marine. 
That’s in addition to withdrawals from the Nigerian and Norwegian funds to help their governments deal with the economic impact of the virus. 
While the lion’s share of sovereign fund investments is still overseas, domestic deals are on the rise. They accounted for 21% of private equity deals in 2019 - already a doubling from 2015 levels, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF). 
“I’d expect greater levels of investment in domestic economies going forward,” said Will Jackson-Moore, global private equity, real assets and sovereign funds leader, PwC. 
“That said, the best opportunities in international markets are going to be in the next 18 months. If there’s demand for short-term emergency funding (from governments) then that could be more of a conflict and it will come down to how governments and sovereign wealth funds balance that.” 
Analysts say returns at home may not necessarily be poorer, particularly if funds can cherry pick deals. Also, many are located in emerging markets, where expected gains can be larger. The rub comes if their remit also includes aiding the development of local economies, in which case some of the payback can flow to the economy as well as the fund. 
Qatar made its name more than a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when its sovereign fund vehicles snapped up stakes in Credit Suisse, Barclays and Volkswagen at a time when illiquidity meant many asset prices were low. 
This year, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages over $300 billion in assets, is making similar waves, last month disclosing stakes in Boeing Co, Citigroup Inc, Facebook Inc, Walt Disney Co and Marriott. 
Still, the PIF is redoubling its domestic focus, said a source familiar with the fund. Its aim is to ensure its portfolio of local assets under management sits at 75% by the end of 2020. PIF did not respond to a request about its current weighting. 
It’s a not dissimilar story for other funds. 
“Many sovereign wealth funds will support national budgets to finance the recovery or support healthcare systems,” said Javier Capape, director of sovereign wealth research at the IE Center for the Governance of Change, pointing to the examples of the sovereign funds of Iran, Kuwait and PIF. 
Ireland’s fund formed a rescue package for small and medium-sized enterprises, while Temasek has helped accelerate the production of a vaccine. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala was set to play a key role in propping up neighbouring Dubai’s economy by linking up assets in the two emirates, sources said last month. 
Mubadala declined comment at the time. 
RAINY DAY 
While the financial pain caused by the virus is undoubtedly the rainy day sovereign funds have been built for, governments are having to weigh their use of resources now against the prospect of providing windfalls for future generations. That dilemma is especially stark in the case of oil wealth funds as hydrocarbon revenues are expected to wane in future years. 
Even before the coronavirus and the plunge in oil prices, drawdowns from Kuwait’s General Reserve Fund, managed by the country’s sovereign fund, meant its assets are estimated by Fitch Ratings to have fallen for the sixth year in a row. 
The Kuwait Investment Authority didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not an oil-based fund, will raise the liquidity of its portfolio to ensure it can provide funds for maintaining Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, while meeting the government’s needs in withdrawing fiscal reserve deposits to deal with the epidemic, a spokesperson said. 
A recent IFSWF survey of oil and non-oil sovereign funds found only two out of 10 said their governments had sought funds, with the same number saying they had received requests to support additional government projects. 
Instead of tapping their rainy day funds, several governments including Gulf states and Kazakhstan have tapped debt capital markets to cover budget shortfalls. Mubadala last month raised $4 billion in bonds. 
“It is interesting the use of leverage to finance the buying spree, it makes sense that sovereign wealth funds prefer to go to the debt markets than withdrawing private equity valuable positions at a loss nowadays,” said Capape. ($1 = 6.8578 liras)

The respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus has been particularly dangerous for the elderly, although other adults and children are also among the 500,000 fatalities and more than 10 million reported cases. 
While the overall rate of death has flattened in recent weeks, health experts have expressed concerns about record numbers of new cases in countries like the United States, India and Brazil, as well as new outbreaks in parts of Asia. 
More than 4,700 people are dying every 24 hours from COVID-19-linked illness, according to Reuters calculations based on an average from June 1 to 27. 
That equates to 196 people per hour, or one person every 18 seconds. (To see a Reuters interactive, open this link in an external browser: tmsnrt.rs/2VqS5PS) 
About one-quarter of all the deaths so far have been in the United States, the Reuters data shows. The recent surge in cases have been most pronounced in a handful of Southern and Western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively. 
The number of cases in Latin America on Sunday surpassed those diagnosed in Europe, making the region the second most affected by the pandemic, after North America. 
The first recorded death from the new virus was on Jan. 9, a 61-year-old man from the Chinese city of Wuhan who was a regular shopper at a wet market that has been identified as the source of the outbreak. 
In just five months, the COVID-19 death toll has overtaken the number of people who die annually from malaria, one of the most deadly infectious diseases. 
The death rate averages out to 78,000 per month, compared with 64,000 AIDS-related deaths and 36,000 malaria deaths, according to 2018 figures from the World Health Organization. 
CHANGING BURIAL RITES 
The high number of deaths has led to changes to traditional and religious burial rites around the world, with morgues and funeral businesses overwhelmed and loved ones often barred from bidding farewell in person. 
In Israel, the custom of washing the bodies of Muslim deceased is not permitted, and instead of being shrouded in cloth, they must be wrapped in a plastic body bag. The Jewish tradition of Shiva where people go to the home of mourning relatives for seven days has also been disrupted. 
In Italy, Catholics have been buried without funerals or a blessing from a priest. In New York, city crematories were at one point working overtime, burning bodies into the night as officials scouted for temporary interment sites. 
In Iraq, former militiamen have dropped their guns to instead dig graves for coronavirus victims at a specially created cemetery. They have learned how to conduct Christian, as well as Muslim, burials. 
ELDERLY AT RISK 
Public health experts are looking at how demographics affect the death rates in different regions. Some European countries with older populations have reported higher fatality rates, for instance. 
An April report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control looked at more than 300,000 cases in 20 countries and found that about 46% of all fatalities were over the age of 80. 
In Indonesia, hundreds of children are believed to have died, a development health officials have attributed to malnutrition, anemia and inadequate child health facilities. 
Health experts caution that the official data likely does not tell the full story, with many believing that both cases and deaths have likely been underreported in some countries.

By Ana Mano 
SAO PAULO, June 23 (Reuters) - Food producer JBS SA was ordered to test all workers for COVID-19 at a Rio Grande do Sul meat plant, labor prosecutors said on Tuesday, on the same day they raised the number of meatpacking plants with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus to 32. 
JBS declined to comment on the decision, saying the plant remained open. 
State prosecutors said a labor court ruled that JBS should test all workers at its Três Passos plant in five days, as well as put on paid leave any employees who test positive for COVID-19, for a minimum of 14 days. 
Slaughterhouses in 23 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul state, the country’s southernmost state, registered COVID-19 cases among food plant workers. The state is Brazil’s third-largest chicken exporter and producer. 
To date, some 4,957 workers at meat plants have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, 25.14% of the state’s total 19,710 cases, the labor prosecutors said. That proportion was as high as 35% at one point, as Brazil became the world’s No. 2 hot spot for the COVID-19 pandemic, behind only the United States. 
There are more than 1.1 million people infected and 52,000 deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil. 
Five employees from Rio Grande do Sul’s meatpacking plants and 12 relatives or friends of people working in the industry died because of the disease, the labor prosecutors said. 
JBS and rival BRF SA, which also operates in the region, had plants closed there and in other states because of outbreaks. 
The pandemic has not affected Rio Grande do Sul’s output or exports so far, according to José Eduardo do Santos, executive director at Asgav, the state’s producers association. 
He told Reuters in a recent interview that the state’s chicken exports rose by 64.5% to 281,400 tonnes between January and May, generating $403 million in the period. 
Meatpackers became hotbeds for the COVID-19 contagion as employees often work at densely packed workstations in cold, virus-preserving environments.

BRASILIA, June 23 (Reuters) - Brazil’s federal tax revenue slumped by almost a third in May to a 15-year low, the federal tax service said on Tuesday, reflecting the shock to economic activity from the quarantine and social isolation measures used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The tax take of 77.4 billion reais ($15 billion) in May marked a decline of 32.9% in real terms from the same month last year, although it was more than the 69.9 billion reais forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
It was the lowest monthly take since May 2005, highlighting the strain on public finances resulting from the crisis that will see government deficits and debts soar to record levels this year. 
The government is forecasting a primary deficit this year excluding interest payments of around 700 billion reais, or just under 10% of gross domestic product, and a jump in overall debt to 93.5% of GDP. 
Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida has said these forecasts may be too optimistic, given the severity of the economic crisis that is choking government revenues and prompting a surge in emergency spending. 
The tax revenue service said the total tax take in the first five months of this year stood at 579.7 billion reais, down 11.9% in real terms from the same period last year. ($1 = 5.15 reais) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

The Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents more than 50 airports, said future passenger numbers at UK airports were expected to be significantly lower, and analysis of its members suggested up to 20,000 jobs were at risk. 
The government should scrap its quarantine regime, provide relief from business rates, extend a job retention scheme, directly fund the sector regulator and suspend air passenger taxes to help save jobs, the AOA said. 
“These jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK’s infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief to the current crisis expected,” said AOA chief executive Karen Dee. 
“Government needs to recognise the immense crisis facing the country’s airport communities and take action to support UK aviation and protect livelihoods.” 
UK-based airlines British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and easyJet have already announced close to 20,000 job losses between them. The country’s biggest airport Heathrow has also started a voluntary redundancy scheme. 
Britain has a 14-day quarantine policy in place for arrivals into the country from abroad, which airlines, airports and the hospitality sector have said is deterring international travel at a time when they had been hoping for it to recover. 
The rule is due to be reviewed on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced and could be replaced by “air bridges”, which would allow restriction-free travel between countries with low infection rates.

There were 2,531 new coronavirus infections reported in the past 24 hours, raising the total number of cases to 212,501, along with 9,996 deaths in all, the ministry said on Wednesday. 
The daily death toll has regularly topped 100 in the past week for the first time in two months, mirroring a sharp rise in new infections since restrictions on movement began to be lifted in mid-April.  
Senior officials have regularly warned that restrictions will be reimposed if health regulations such as social distancing to stem the surge in infections are not observed. 
In a sign of such concern, the Islamic Republic’s official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday that Friday prayers at mosques will not resume in the capital Tehran this week despite an announcement last week that they would. 
On Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani said the government was considering making it mandatory within days to wear masks in public places and covered spaces given the surge in the number of confirmed infections.

The U.S. stock market has consistently outperformed Europe since the 2016 election of Trump, which was followed by a rally widely dubbed the ‘Trump bump’. 
Fund flows suggest a shift in sentiment. Bank of America’s latest weekly report on Friday showed $6.6 billion left U.S. equity funds, the largest exodus in seven weeks, while $800 million made their way into European ones. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 has outperformed world stocks by about 1.5% in the last month, while Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 .SPX has underperformed by the same extent. 
Among factors boosting European assets is Europe’s relative success in gradually reopening its economy and the European Union’s proposed 750 billion euro ($841.73 billion) recovery fund to help countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. 
The spending plan, which could be approved in July, would bring the EU closer to a fiscal union and as such has boosted sentiment and soothed recurrent worries about peripheral euro zone countries such as Italy. 
The common currency has risen 4% since France and Germany unveiled a joint proposal for the recovery fund on May 18. 
Graphic: Wall Street lags on virus, election angst here
APPEAL 
“The strengthening of the euro reinforces the appeal of European equities, particularly for U.S. investors”, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. 
“There’s a very strong re-rating potential for the European market which has long been underinvested and undervalued.” 
Before the COVID-19 financial crash, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX had gained over 60% since November 2016, about twice as much as the pan European STOXX 600 . 
“We are warming up to European assets as the region steps up its policy response and demonstrates relative success in tamping virus growth,” BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, told its clients on Monday. 
Similarly, Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating for Europe to “overweight” for the next three months, citing “a combination of favourable tailwinds”. 
Investors were pleasantly surprised this week when IHS Markit’s euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, reached 47.5, moving closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. newsflow was less favourable, with record COVID-19 infections and jobs data suggesting the labour market could take years to recover. 
Opinion polls give Biden a substantial lead over Trump both nationally and in key states, and betting odds currently give the Democrat candidate a 60% chance of winning.

Goldman Sachs said the possibility of a Biden victory - and the possible reversal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts - wasn’t fully priced into markets. 
Given the uncertainty of the race and bearing in mind the surprise win of Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, many may choose to stay on the sidelines and wait for the dust to settle. 
“European equities may get an edge over their U.S. peers as we get closer to the U.S. election,” Morgan Stanley’s head of cross-asset strategy Andrew Sheets told Reuters.

But at the same time that many people are seemingly appreciating those around them, our new research has found that COVID-19 has led to a rise in online Islamophobic hate speech.
My colleague, Roxana Khan-Williams, and I have examined the impacts of COVID-19 on social media. Weve found that COVID-19 has been used by the far-right to peddle Islamophobic hate.
Our study, which was conducted on behalf of the Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group,provides a snapshot of the type of language used online about Muslims and COVID-19. And what weve found is that stereotypes fueled by conspiracy theories, memes , and fake videos create the perfect climate for the demonization of Muslims.
One video, for example, shared on the Tommy Robinson News channel on the messaging app Telegram, alleges to show a group of Muslim men leaving a secret mosque in Birmingham to pray. Despite the fact the video is fake and West Midlands Police have confirmed the mosque is closed, it has been watched over 14,000 times.
Read: [Why conspiracy theories flourish during pandemics]
At risk of attacks
As someone who has spent their academic career researching Islamophobia, I am not surprised or shocked to see this level of vitriolic hate. But it does demonstrate how quickly the internet can act as an echo chamber and how easily such narratives become normalized.
Even more worrying, is that this type of Islamophobic bigotry found on social media reinforces the them versus us narrative by using issues such as deprivation, poverty, social cohesion, and social mobility as a Muslim problem. Indeed, many of the online posts we analyzed targeted Muslims because of social and economic issues. All of which leaves Muslims more at risk of Islamophobic attacks when lockdown lifts.
The tweet below, for example, specifically labels Muslims as muzrats, a word used to describe Muslims as vermin and disease.
We also found that levels of Islamophobia increase around certain events. Ramadan, for example, seems to have led to a wave of conspiracy theories around Muslims with claims the virus is likely to spread around this time.
We also found the depiction of British Muslims on social media was synonymous with deviance and being a problem-group. And that a number of fake news stories featured claims that Muslims are flouting social distancing measures to attend mosque. One picture, for example, taken outside a Leeds mosque appears to show Muslims breaking the rules of lockdown, despite this having been taken two weeks before the official lockdown began.
In another example of fake news, a Twitter user claimed to have spoken to his local mosque in Shrewsbury. The user claimed to be horrified to find out this mosque was still open, adding that people inside could be super spreaders of the virus, and urged the police to act. The police have confirmed, however, that there is no mosque in Shrewsbury.
Similarly, a picture emerged on Twitter that seemed to show Muslims praying on the streets of central London and not adhering to social distancing rules. Again, the story was debunked as the picture had been taken several weeks ago.
Muslims are the enemy
The problem with such disinformation is that it can lead to wider retribution against Muslims. On one Facebook post, for example, messages from users indicated they wanted Muslims off the streets!! another added that Muslims are praying in groups then driving taxis afterward.
We also found evidence of users focusing on grooming events in Rotherham to call British Muslims deviant. Another user stated that all over the world these ignorant religious idiots are responsible for spreading this further. This led to wider dehumanizing language around wanting British Muslims to go back home.
Evidence suggests that BAME people seem to be the most impacted by COVID-19. Figures show that 35% of almost 2000 patients in intensive care units are from a BAME background, compared to 14% of the UK population. And the sad truth is that, as we fight the pandemic offline, a pandemic is also spreading online.
Social media companies must do more to tackle this and remove posts that are clearly using dehumanizing language. If not, the risk is that this could escalate to attacks and incidents when restrictions on movement are lifted.

But the toll became clear as deaths mounted. First, one of the sheriff’s jail commanders died; then, a deputy in a medical unit. 
“Working in the Wayne County Jail has now become a DEATH sentence!” the head of the deputy sheriffs’ union, Randall Crawford, wrote on Facebook as the losses mounted. 
By mid-April, the jail system’s medical director and one of its doctors also had died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The virus was everywhere, but jail officials had little sense of who was infected and spreading it. 
Testing of inmates and staff needed to determine who should be quarantined to slow transmission was just getting started. In the weeks since, more than 200 staff and inmates have tested positive. 
COVID-19 has spread rapidly behind bars in Detroit and across the nation, according to an analysis of data gathered by Reuters from 20 county jail systems, 10 state prison systems and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which runs federal penitentiaries. 
But scant testing and inconsistent reporting from state and local authorities have frustrated efforts to track or contain its spread, particularly in local jails. And figures compiled by the U.S. government appear to undercount the number of infections dramatically in correctional settings, Reuters found. 
In a May 6 report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed 54 state and territorial health departments for data on confirmed COVID-19 infections in all correctional facilities local jails, state prisons and federal prisons and detention centers. Thirty-seven of those agencies provided data between April 22-28, reporting just under 5,000 inmate cases. 
Reuters documented well over three times the CDC’s tally of COVID-19 infections about 17,300 in its far more modest survey of local, state and federal corrections facilities conducted about two weeks later. The Reuters survey encompassed jails and prisons holding only 13% of the more than 2 million people behind bars nationwide. Among state prisons doing mass testing of all inmates, Reuters found, some are seeing infection rates up to 65%. 
The CDC tally “is dramatically low,” said Aaron Littman, a teaching fellow specializing in prison law and policy at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles. “We don’t have a particularly good handle” on COVID-19 infections in many correctional and detention facilities, “and in some places we have no handle at all.” 
Problems with unreliable data aren’t unique to corrections. Epidemiologists say the incidence of COVID-19 in the general U.S. population also is unclear due to limited testing, especially in the pandemic’s early days. And the CDC acknowledged in its report that its infection count for jails and prisons was similarly hampered by spotty data and “not representative” of the disease’s true prevalence in those facilities. 
But uneven testing for COVID-19 in correctional settings and erratic reporting of confirmed cases have profound implications for health officials and policy makers tracking its spread, because epidemiologists see jails and prisons as key pathways of transmission. 
EVIDENCE OF “A CRISIS” 
The United States has more people behind bars than any other nation, a total incarcerated population of more than 2.2 million as of 2018, including nearly 1.5 million in state and federal prisons and just under 740,000 in local jails, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
Jails generally keep inmates for short stays: arrestees awaiting trial or people serving short sentences. The churn of these inmates raises the risk of infections among both the inmates themselves and jail staff, who can carry the virus to and from the community. 
Prisons, which hold convicted criminals on longer sentences, also are fertile ground for the virus. While inmates come and go far less frequently, the pathogen can be carried in from the community by a single contagious staffer, spread quickly in crowded cell blocks, and be re-introduced to the community by other, newly infected workers. 
Reuters collected data from 37 state prison facilities across the country that have done mass testing for COVID-19 among all inmates, including those with no symptoms, and found more than 10,000 confirmed cases among the 44,000 tested. There were 91 deaths from the disease at those facilities, which span 10 states. 
In contrast, federal prisons, which typically limit testing to inmates with obvious symptoms, reported confirmed infections in fewer than 4,200 of their total inmate population of about 150,000, with 52 deaths. 
The situation in the nation’s 2,800 local jails is even more opaque. Many don’t report their COVID-19 cases publicly, and there is no national tracking of their infection numbers. 
Reuters surveyed the 20 U.S. counties with the largest jails, holding an average total of about 73,000 inmates, and found nearly 2,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases a figure that has risen nearly 30-fold over the past six weeks. While some of that increase is a result of increased testing during that time, it still reflects an almost certain undercount, because testing remains limited in many of those facilities. 
The surge in jail infections comes amid a chorus of concerns from judges, oversight agencies, corrections officers, defense lawyers and civil rights groups that most local lockups are ill-equipped to control the virus, which has killed at least 310,600 people worldwide. Unlike state and federal prisons, typically equipped to provide health care for long-term inmates, jails often have little medical capacity. 
In health care, jail inmates “are the last and the least and the lost,” said Dr. Thomas Pangburn, chief medical officer for Wellpath LLC, the medical contractor in Wayne County’s jails and hundreds of others nationwide. Many jails have been overlooked in the race to secure COVID-19 test kits and medical supplies for hospitals and nursing homes, he said, but “we have the most vulnerable population in a very confined space meant for correctional housing and not for medical care.” 
In many jails and prisons, the toll of COVID-19 on corrections officers and other staff approaches that of inmates and here, too, the numbers reported to the CDC by state and local authorities appear to be a vast undercount. 
The CDC report documented nearly 2,800 COVID-19 cases among staff across all U.S. correctional facilities. But Reuters found more than 80% of that number upwards of 2,300 infected jail and prison workers in its far less comprehensive survey of just the federal prison system, a few dozen state prisons and the 20 counties with the biggest local jails. 
In an effort to curb infection rates, many jails and prisons are releasing inmates to create more distance among those remaining behind bars. That has raised concerns about whether inmates, particularly in jails, are being screened for COVID-19 before returning to the community, where many can’t get medical care. 
More than 37,000 state and federal prisoners have been released since March 31, according to U.S. government data and records collected from 41 state prison systems by the Vera Institute of Justice, a research group that seeks to reduce incarcerated populations. There is no national tracking of local jail releases, but in just the 20 counties surveyed by Reuters, at least 14,000 jail inmates have been let go. 
Releasing inmates is critical “both in jails and surrounding communities, because of the role jails serve as vectors” for spreading the virus, said Udi Ofer, justice division director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed dozens of “decarceration” suits and legal petitions. “It’s a crisis.” 
Some groups have pushed back. Victims’ rights group Marsy’s Law, named after the murdered sister of billionaire Henry Nicholas, has criticized the releases, expressing concern that crime victims aren’t always notified when inmates are let out. 
NO TESTS, NO PROTECTION 
U.S. President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency on March 13. By that time, officials in the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office already were scrambling to address a looming outbreak in their three jails. 
Days earlier, Sheriff Benny Napoleon and Chief Robert Dunlap, the jails supervisor, had laid plans to keep inmates more separated, cut public visits and quarantine new arrivals rules that took effect just after Trump’s announcement. On March 19, the jail also began releasing low-level offenders, for the most part inmates with risky medical conditions. 
Staff and inmates were already falling ill across the jail system, which typically houses a population of about 1,400. Donafay Collins, 63, a jail commander, was hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection that would kill him less than two weeks later the first death among the four staffers claimed by the virus. 
“It’s like a bad dream,” Chief Dunlap said in an interview with Reuters. 
Meanwhile, getting diagnostic tests and protective equipment to track and manage the virus proved challenging, Dunlap said. Suppliers had little to offer, and just about everything they had was going to hospitals and emergency medical services. 
Hunting for face masks, the sheriff’s office turned to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who had been pressing the federal government to give states more supplies from federal stockpiles. On March 20, state officials sent the sheriff 7,500 N-95 masks provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
The highly protective masks are used by staff handling sick inmates, Dunlap said. Basic surgical masks became available later for more routine use by both staff and inmates, he added. 
Getting test kits proved even harder. As COVID-19 raced through Wayne County’s jails in March, corrections officers needing tests had to visit a local testing center or hospital, where they often were refused if they did not show specific symptoms, Dunlap said. It wasn’t until April 6 the day the virus killed the jails’ medical director, Dr. Angelo Patsalis that officers began getting regular tests through the Wayne State University Physician Group. 
Getting the tests was “a matter of life and death,” said Crawford, the head of the deputy sheriffs’ union, in an interview. 
For inmates, however, testing remained elusive. 
In late March, the sheriff directed the jail’s medical contractor, Wellpath, to obtain test kits for inmates, but the company couldn’t get enough due to heavy demand, Dunlap said. “Wellpath, like every other provider around this county, couldn’t get them.” So, COVID-19 testing was limited to inmates with symptoms. 
By April 30, the jail’s population had dropped to just 834 inmates about 500 had been released and only 89 had been tested for the new coronavirus. Of those tested, 29 were positive, just over 30%, according to the sheriff’s office. Among the sheriff’s 810-member staff, 196 had tested positive, or 23% of whom 89 have returned to work. 
On May 7, the jail expanded testing to all inmates under a grant from the Hudson Webber Foundation. That should “further mitigate the spread of the virus” inside and outside the jail, Dunlap said, and help identify infected inmates before release. 
As in many states, Michigan’s prison system began universal testing earlier than the jails. 
On April 21, Michigan’s Department of Corrections began testing for coronavirus infections in large numbers of inmates even if they showed no sign of illness, said department spokesman Chris Gautz. 
Demands for mass testing are growing. The ACLU and the Council of Prison Locals, representing 30,000 federal prison employees, called earlier this month for universal testing in all federal lockups. 
But some public health experts are ambivalent on that approach. The CDC’s guidance for correctional facilities calls for quick COVID-19 testing of inmates who appear symptomatic, but it takes no position on universal testing. 
The guidance reflects a belief among some public health experts that testing only symptomatic inmates and, in some scenarios, a sample of the rest may suffice for assessing the virus’ overall prevalence in a jail or prison, said Marc Stern, former medical director for the Washington State prison system and a faculty member at the University of Washington School of Public Health. Testing every asymptomatic inmate may not make sense if a jail lacks the capacity to isolate and trace the contacts of those who test positive and also because not everyone who tests positive may be contagious. 
In Michigan’s prison system, however, officials say mass testing has been valuable. 
“If you don’t know where the problem is, you can’t fix it,” spokesman Gautz said. 
‘IT’S CRAZY IN THERE’ 
Charles Peterson, 78, began showing symptoms of COVID-19 a week after a parole violation landed him in Colorado’s Weld County Jail on March 11. By the time he was released on March 30, he was on the verge of dying from it. 
Peterson declined quickly, two fellow inmates told Reuters. Coughing and disoriented, they said, he eventually struggled to stand and began losing control of his bladder and bowels. 
Donovan Birch said he and other inmates alerted jail staff, but Peterson was left in the general population. Birch also became ill with COVID-19 symptoms after his exposure to Peterson, he said, but never was tested. 
Peterson “needed help,” said Birch, who was jailed on a parole violation for trespassing charges. “I knew he was going to die if he didn’t get it.” 
Instead, Peterson was released; two days later, he was dead. Official cause: “acute respiratory failure, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 infection.” 
Peterson likely was a “superspreader,” according to an infectious disease expert who inspected the jail on behalf of inmates for a lawsuit they filed seeking better sanitary and safety measures. By early May, at least 10 of the jail’s roughly 480 inmates had tested positive for the virus but just 22 had been tested. Eighteen deputies had also been infected, the jail said. 
The inmates’ lawsuit claims Weld County Sheriff Steven Reams “willfully disregarded public health guidelines” by leaving three to four inmates to a cell, sharing sinks and toilets, as the virus spread. “Failing to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 endangers not only those within the institution,” the suit says, “but the entire community.” Reams declined to comment. 
The case is among more than 100 lawsuits nationwide, many of them class-action cases, seeking mass releases of inmates or other measures to reduce overcrowding and infection risks in jails hit by the new coronavirus, according to the UCLA law school’s COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project. Many of those cases, as well as hundreds more filed by individual inmates, argue that confinement in facilities with COVID-19 outbreaks violates the U.S. Constitution’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment. 
Inmates have been issued masks since early April and have access to soap, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies, said Weld County Sheriff’s spokesman Joe Moylan. He noted the jail has been on lockdown since April 1 the day Peterson died and inmates are rotated out of their cells in small groups to common areas that allow for social distancing. He declined to comment on the litigation and the specific cases of Peterson and Birch. 
Peterson was released after Colorado’s Department of Corrections decided not to hold him for his parole violation, part of the effort to slow COVID-19 transmission in local jails by reducing inmate populations. Since March 1, the jail has reduced its population by more than 300 inmates; fewer than half its 954 beds are occupied. 
Peterson’s parole violation involved failing to renew his sex offender registration while living at “Rock Found,” a re-entry home for convicts returning to the community. When he was let out of jail, a former Rock Found roommate brought him back to the home, cold, shivering, barely able to walk. 
The program director called paramedics. 
“I honestly could not believe that not a single person from the Weld County Jail had told anyone at Rock Found that they were releasing a seriously sick person into our care,” the director, Cheryl Cook, said in a statement filed in the inmates’ lawsuit. 
Moylan, the sheriff’s spokesman, said Peterson was not tested for COVID-19 because he was not overtly symptomatic. 
The conditions at the jail violated the constitutional rights of medically vulnerable inmates, a federal judge ruled May 11. He ordered the sheriff to socially distance those at risk, provide single cells when possible, and improve cleaning of communal spaces. 
Many of the problems addressed by the judge were identified by the plaintiffs’ expert witness during two visits to the jail in April. He reported to the court that he found most inmates confined to group cells more than 22 hours a day with no handwashing options unless they were let out to a bathroom. Many complained of unsanitary conditions and said shared sinks and toilets were not cleaned between uses, the expert reported. 
Ralph Brewer, 41, jailed for violating a restraining order, told Reuters he was directed to continue working in the kitchen after developing nausea and a bad cough. Staffing was short, he was told, so he had to work unless he had a fever. 
“It really concerned me. We had no masks, just gloves,” Brewer said. He requested a doctor to check his lungs, he said, but nurses only gave him Tylenol, cough medicine and instructions to stay hydrated. 
Brewer was released on April 3 and his daughter took him straight to an urgent care clinic. The doctor said he had COVID-19 symptoms no tests were available and told him to quarantine for 14 days, Brewer said. He recovered at his mother’s house. 
“I was lucky to get out, but I’m worried about the people still in jail,” Brewer said. “It’s crazy in there.”

Broward County, outside Miami, has used daily attendance as a tool to quickly find students who were unable to participate in online classes because their households lacked laptops or internet access. Checking attendance has also helped officials identify those children in families particularly hard hit by the pandemic, whether through illness or financial setbacks. 
“A lot of kids are in home situations that are even more stressed than they have ever been,” said Robert Runcie, superintendent of the district, the sixth-largest in the United States, with 330 schools and 270,000 students. The district closed its school buildings on March 16 and launched online classes on March 30. 
“If we’re not tracking their attendance,” he said, “then in some ways we are neglecting our responsibility to make sure those kids are safe.” 
That puts Broward County in the minority. Only a third of 100 school districts tracked by the Center on Reinventing Public Education in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic have said they are still taking attendance. 
A handful of states, including California and Texas, have waived average daily attendance requirements for state funding. In those states, districts are now receiving state money even if they have stopped monitoring attendance. 
Many large districts, including Los Angeles and Chicago, have stopped taking daily classroom attendance. Others track students only when they download materials, complete assignments or answer daily questions online. 
“Teachers are not necessarily in contact with students every day,” said Hedy Chang, director of Attendance Works, an organization that tracks attendance policy. 
“If your remote learning strategy is just sending packets home, then what’s attendance?” she said. 
NO STONE UNTURNED 
By contrast, Broward students are counted as present after logging in to an online portal, a single entry point to the district’s suite of educational applications. Teachers also count students who are participating online and measure their engagement. 
A student is marked absent if he or she fails to log in, triggering a response from school officials who will call parents, family members and even friends in hopes of tracking down and reconnecting with the pupil. 
That effort has exposed the so-called digital divide among students. Attendance data, for example, showed 13 students who live in a disadvantaged neighborhood of Broward County were absent from school three weeks ago. 
When the district discovered the students lived in households without internet service, it dispatched a technician to bring them mobile hot spots, enabling them to log in to virtual classes. 
“We will not leave a stone unturned,” said Laurel Thompson, the district’s director of student services. “Every child matters.” 
Since the pandemic struck, the district has distributed more than 90,000 laptops and mobile hot spots, officials said. 
But some students have struggled to attend online classes as they are now working full-time to help support their struggling families, dealing with sick family members or living in unstable homes. When they appear absent, the district has dispatched social workers to connect the student with support services. 
Frequent absence from class is usually “a symptom of something more,” Thompson said. “We have an ethical responsibility and a moral mandate to serve these students and their families.” 
The effort to track down and help absent students through attendance taking has been fruitful, Broward officials said. In recent weeks, the district has reduced its number of non-engaged students from 6,600 to 1,700. Overall, the district’s daily attendance during the pandemic is at 91%, or 3 percentage points lower than normal. 
In one case, Broward second-grade teacher Vivian Lewis noticed during her daily attendance-taking that one of her students was absent from online classes. After phone calls to his Spanish-speaking family, she was able to help him get logged in to virtual classes. 
“I felt like he was thinking, ‘Where’s everybody? Where’s my teacher? Why isn’t she checking on me?’” Lewis said. “I could envision him ... being scared.”

Under increasing pressure to defend his record on fighting Covid-19, he said: “We brought in the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown.” 
An examination by Reuters of the guidance issued to care homes, as well as interviews with three care home providers, has provided no evidence that any such early lockdown was ordered. 
The government's handling of care homes has emerged as a major controversy in parliament. According to a Reuters analysis of official figures here the pandemic has resulted in over 20,000 deaths in UK care homes. 
The prime minister’s spokesman told reporters on Wednesday that in his comments earlier that day to parliament, Johnson was referring to government advice to care homes, issued on March 13. This advice, he said, was “recommending essential visits only, that obviously came before we took steps nationwide in relation to social distancing.” The government issued a general lockdown order to the nation on March 23. 
The March 13 guidance here://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance/covid-19-guidance-on-residential-care-provision by the government was equivocal, a review of the documents shows. The advisory, reviewed by Reuters, did not impose a ban on visits from family or friends. 
Instead, the document from Public Health England, an official agency, advised home providers to “review their visiting policy by asking no one to visit who has suspected Covid-19 or is generally unwell, and by emphasising good hand hygiene for visitors.” Balancing those restrictions, it said that care home policies “should also consider the wellbeing of residents, and the positive impact of seeing friends and family.” 
At a press conference on March 16, Johnson commented that “absolutely, we don’t want to see people unnecessarily visiting care homes.” 
Reuters found no official guidance which made that advice mandatory. The news agency asked 10 Downing Street, Johnson’s office, if it could point to any official order that care homes must close to outside visitors, prior to the broader UK lockdown on March 23. A government spokeswoman referred Reuters to the March 13 advice. Asked if there were further instructions to care homes between March 13 and the March 23 general lockdown, the spokeswoman said there were not. 
In a statement, the government said it had been “keeping in regular contact with care homes to provide guidance on reducing the spread of infection. We have continued to review and update our guidance, in line with the latest scientific advice.” 
The government’s cautious approach to imposing restrictions was signaled earlier in March by Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser. At the launch of the government’s coronavirus action plan, on March 3, Whitty told journalists that specific advice for care homes would be issued in future, “but one of the things we are keen to avoid is doing things too early.” He explained that premature action would bring no benefit “but what you do get is a social cost.” 
A Reuters investigation last week here detailed how the government's focus on shielding hospitals, to prevent emergency wards from being overwhelmed, left care home residents and staff exposed to COVID-19. To free up hospital beds, many patients were discharged into homes for the elderly and vulnerable, many without being tested for the coronavirus that causes the disease. 
On May 5, when Reuters initially asked the Department for Health and Social Care when an order was first given to ban care home visits by family and friends, a press officer responded: “There was no order, care providers make their own decisions about visitors.” 
Later that day, another press officer said the guidance was issued in a document dated April 2 here which said visits should only be made in exceptional circumstances, such as when residents are dying. That guidance was issued 10 days after the national lockdown and 20 days after the earlier, more nuanced advice to care homes. 
Joyce Pinfield, who runs two care homes and is on the board of directors at the National Care Association, a body which represents care providers, said she spent time Wednesday after Johnson’s comments to parliament trying to find out when the order to lock down care homes was made. She said she found no trace of any order prior to the wider UK lockdown on March 23 and the April 2 instruction closing homes to outside visits, and concluded there hadn’t been one. 
“The guidance should have been far better,” she said. “It was left to care providers to make their own decisions.” 
Pinfield’s view was echoed by Julie Nicholls, the manager of the Appleby Lodge residential home in Cornwall. Nicholls said care home managers were left to make their own decisions about whether to restrict visits. She closed her care home on March 13, the day after the government moved the threat level of the virus to “high” and the prime minister warned the nation to expect to lose loved ones. 
Nicholls said she “definitely didn’t have any government guidance” to close before the general lockdown ordered by Johnson on March 23. “There was never a formal order,” she said. 
Opposition MPs have accused Johnson this week of misleading parliament over the government’s handling of the coronavirus. 
Labour leader, Keir Starmer, confronted the prime minister in parliament on Wednesday with Public Health England guidance for care homes that was in place from February 25 to March 12. This stated, as reported by Reuters on May 5, that “it remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home will become infected.” A government spokesman told Reuters in early May that the advice “accurately reflected the situation at the time when there was a limited risk of the infection getting into a care home.” 
Johnson replied to Starmer that “it wasn’t true that the advice said that.” 
After the debate, Starmer wrote to Johnson asking him to correct his remark. The prime minister responded that he stood by his comments and accused the Labour leader of selectively and misleadingly quoting from the documents.

As a cautionary tale, it could hardly be more stark. 
For while the images from the Adria Tour exhibition tournament in Serbia and Croatia were no doubt a fillip for some fans starved of top-flight tennis action, the organisers also tempted fate with the lack of precautions. 
Though the players were not breaking government protocols during the tournament, which was organised by Djokovic, it highlighted the risks of athletes from different countries mingling without adhering to what have become social distancing norms. 
    Few were, therefore, surprised when Djokovic contracted the virus with Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, Croatia’s Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki having already tested positive after playing in his Balkan event. [nL8N2E03KO] 
Hindsight offers clarity, but organisers of the world’s biggest tournaments say they will not make the same mistakes as they reopen the sport and seek to keep the players safe. 
“There were a fair few learnings that have come out of that (Adria Tour),” Tennis Australia’s (TA) Chief Operating Officer Tom Larner told Reuters. 
“And whilst, certainly the whole event was actually really well-intentioned in terms of raising money for charity, the execution was clearly not great, as were the processes in place.” 
Australia had successfully curbed the virus spread but a double-digit increase in new cases recently has triggered fear of another wave due to apparent community transmission. 
TA gave a glimpse of the biosecurity protocols that could be in place for next year’s Australian Open while announcing measures for the domestic UTR Pro Tennis Series, which will be played at closed stadiums. [nL4N2E11A8] 
Players would have to bring their own towels and will be encouraged to shower off-site. On-court personnel would be limited to an umpire, minimal line judges with no ball-kids. 
NO SPECTATORS 
First up, though, will be the U.S. Open, scheduled to be held in New York from Aug. 31. Organisers have come under fire, including from Djokovic, who initially called their measures “extreme”. They will now feel vindicated. 
    “This situation is exactly why we have created a comprehensive health and medical plan... that was approved by New York State,” USTA spokesman Chris Widmaier told Reuters. 
    “The creation of a controlled U.S. Open environment, including official hotels, transportation, food, medical and safety protocols, enables us to mitigate potential risk, and appropriately respond to any issues.” 
    The U.S. Open will have no spectators, there will be limitations on players’ entourage and everyone must wear masks when onsite unless practising or competing. Testing will be conducted before travelling to the United States and at least once per week along with daily temperature checks. 
    New York City has witnessed an easing of lockdown restrictions in recent days but residents have been asked to follow social distancing norms and cover faces in public. 
    Restaurants and bars began offering outdoor service and many retailers started to allow patrons back into their stores. 
    Serbia introduced a state of emergency soon after the pandemic broke out, including daily curfews for 12 hours, but gradual easing of measures saw 25,000 fans flock to a soccer derby between Belgrade rivals Red Star and Partizan on June 10. 
    A sellout crowd of 4,000 attended both days of the Belgrade leg of Djokovic’s tournament, staged at his tennis centre by the Danube River. 
    Croatia, where the tournament’s second leg was held in Zadar, still had social distancing norms in place and the Visnjik tennis complex, with a capacity of 9,000, hosted half as many spectators. 
    It did not stop Djokovic and his fellow players from playing basketball there, images of which were jarring to many as the majority of the world continued to battle the virus. 
    Djokovic, who heads the players council of the men’s ATP Tour, said he was wrong and “deeply sorry”.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 12 cents, or 0.3%, to $38.13 at 0129 GMT after dropping $2.36 on Wednesday. 
Brent crude futures climbed 5 cents, or 0.1%, to $40.36, after falling $2.32 on Wednesday. A day earlier, the benchmark contract hit its highest price since early March, just before pandemic lockdowns and a Saudi-Russian price war slammed markets. 
Wednesday’s selloff came after U.S. government data showed crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels, driving inventories to a record high for a third straight week last week. 
However analysts said that was mostly due to a flotilla of Saudi cargoes booked by U.S. refiners when prices slumped in March. Those shipments are due to ease soon. 
On the positive side, the U.S. data showed a healthy increase in implied demand for gasoline, said National Australia Bank’s head of commodity research, Lachlan Shaw. 
Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, jumped by 9% from the previous week, and U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 1.7 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, a bigger draw than analysts had expected. 
However worries about a second wave of COVID-19 cases in several U.S. states, where lockdowns had eased, and a rapid spread of infections in South America and South Asia are expected to keep a lid on fuel demand. 
The fear is that even if lockdowns are eased, people will stay home because of the perceived health risks. 
“The latest trends there are not encouraging,” Shaw said. 
Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiCorp, said mobility data from Google showed driving in Texas, Florida and to a certain extent California was flatlining. 
In another reminder of fuel demand woes, Australia’s flagship airline, Qantas Airways, said on Thursday it expected little revival in international travel until at least July 2021, as it slashed a fifth of its workforce and grounded 100 planes. 
“It highlights the reality that we’re talking years before international aviation recovers probably three to four years,” Shaw said.

In its quarterly inflation report, the central bank repeated its view from last week’s policy meeting, when it cut interest rates by 75 basis points to a record low of 2.25%, that room for further policy stimulus was small. 
The central bank said its dramatic downward revision was largely due to the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, which now has the world’s second highest number of confirmed cases and deaths behind the United States. 
The economy is expected to recover in the second half of the year, but only gradually. 
“Daily and weekly data suggest that activity reached its lowest level in April, with only a partial recovery in May and June,” the central bank said. 
“The level of uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery throughout the second half of this year remains higher than normal,” it added. 
A gross domestic product slump of 6.4% is in line with market consensus and steeper than the government’s -4.7% forecast. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday slashed its 2020 GDP outlook to -9.1% from -5.3%. 
Inflation is still on track to undershoot its 2020 and 2021 targets of 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively, according to models using a mix of interest and exchange rate variables, the central bank said. 
In four scenarios outlined the report, 2020 projections varied from 1.9% to 2.4%, and the range for next year was from 3% to 3.2%. 
Among its key economic revisions, the central bank now sees industry contracting by 8.5% instead of shrinking 0.5% as predicted three months ago, 
Fixed business investment is expected to shrink by 13.8% instead of 1.1%, and services, which accounts for two-thirds of all activity, is expected to contract 5.3%.

The U.S. stock market has consistently outperformed Europe since the 2016 election of Trump, which was followed by a rally widely dubbed the ‘Trump bump’. 
Fund flows suggest a shift in sentiment. Bank of America’s latest weekly report on Friday showed $6.6 billion left U.S. equity funds, the largest exodus in seven weeks, while $800 million made their way into European ones. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 has outperformed world stocks by about 1.5% in the last month, while Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 .SPX has underperformed by the same extent. 
Among factors boosting European assets is Europe’s relative success in gradually reopening its economy and the European Union’s proposed 750 billion euro ($841.73 billion) recovery fund to help countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. 
The spending plan, which could be approved in July, would bring the EU closer to a fiscal union and as such has boosted sentiment and soothed recurrent worries about peripheral euro zone countries such as Italy. 
The common currency has risen 4% since France and Germany unveiled a joint proposal for the recovery fund on May 18. 
Graphic: Wall Street lags on virus, election angst here
APPEAL 
“The strengthening of the euro reinforces the appeal of European equities, particularly for U.S. investors”, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. 
“There’s a very strong re-rating potential for the European market which has long been underinvested and undervalued.” 
Before the COVID-19 financial crash, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX had gained over 60% since November 2016, about twice as much as the pan European STOXX 600 . 
“We are warming up to European assets as the region steps up its policy response and demonstrates relative success in tamping virus growth,” BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, told its clients on Monday. 
Similarly, Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating for Europe to “overweight” for the next three months, citing “a combination of favourable tailwinds”. 
Investors were pleasantly surprised this week when IHS Markit’s euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, reached 47.5, moving closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. newsflow was less favourable, with record COVID-19 infections and jobs data suggesting the labour market could take years to recover. 
Opinion polls give Biden a substantial lead over Trump both nationally and in key states, and betting odds currently give the Democrat candidate a 60% chance of winning. 
Goldman Sachs said the possibility of a Biden victory - and the possible reversal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts - wasn’t fully priced into markets. 
Given the uncertainty of the race and bearing in mind the surprise win of Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, many may choose to stay on the sidelines and wait for the dust to settle. 
“European equities may get an edge over their U.S. peers as we get closer to the U.S. election,” Morgan Stanley’s head of cross-asset strategy Andrew Sheets told Reuters.

The study was published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It follows a study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine that also showed the drug doesn't fight the virus. 
Even before these reports were published, the US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health issued warnings about using the drugs for coronavirus patients. 
In the most recent study, researchers at the University at Albany looked at 1,438 patients with coronavirus who were admitted to 25 New York City area hospitals. After statistical adjustments, the death rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine was similar to those who did not take the drug. The death rate for those taking hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, was also similar. 
However, the patients who took the drug combination were more than twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest during the course of the study. Heart issues are a known side effect of hydroxychloroquine. 
""The big takeaway for me from this study is that it's very consistent with the FDA and NIH guidelines that came out in April,"" said one of the study's senior authors, David Holtgrave, dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany. ""When deciding on public health interventions and treatments for Covid-19 or any other disease, it's really important to follow the data and follow the science and make sure decisions are being made on the highest quality data possible."" 
This study likely won't be the last word on the drugs. Researchers at the University of Washington, New York University and other centers are still testing the drug in patients. 
In the clinical trials, coronavirus patients are randomly assigned to take the drugs or to take placebos, which have no effect, and then the death rates between the two groups will compared. These types of studies are considered the most reliable.
Trump's enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine 
Starting in mid-March, President Trump became a frequent cheerleader for hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and other diseases and the antibiotic azithromycin, often sold under the brand name Zithromax, or as a""Z-pack."" 
He promoted the drugs nearly 50 times, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not. 
""HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,"" Trump tweeted on March 21. 
Fox News frequently echoed Trump, but both the network and the president quieted down about the drugs once studies started showing they didn't work and possibly could hurt. 
No difference in death rates 
Trump's enthusiasm for the drugs was based on a French study of 20 patients in March that showed the drugs might work against the virus. That study was criticized for poor methodology, with experts calling it ""pathetic"" and ""a complete failure."" 
The medical society that published that study later said the study ""does not meet the Society's expected standard."" 
But the study was enough to excite Trump, and enough to excite doctors, who were free to prescribe the drugs because they're both already on the market to treat patients with other illnesses. 
The latest study in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at the medical records of 18% of all coronavirus patients hospitalized in the New York City area from March 15 to March 28. 
In this group, doctors prescribed both drugs to 735 patients, just hydroxychloroquine to 271 patients, just azithromycin to 211 patients and neither drug to 221 patients. 
They found that those taking hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with the antibiotic, were sicker than other patients to begin with and as time went on had a higher death rate. However, once the researchers statistically adjusted for the fact that the patients who took the drugs were sicker to start with, there was no statistical significance between the two death rates. 
Overall, the patients had a 20% death rate. 
The patients in the study were in the hospital, and other research teams are studying whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus infection or slow it down in the beginning stages of the disease.

The pushback underscores how House Democratic leaders are being attacked on all sides over the legislation -- by congressional Republicans, who have dismissed the legislation as an liberal wish list, as well as within their own ranks by both progressives and moderates. 
Despite the criticism from both progressives and moderates, House Democrats leaders have expressed confidence that the package will pass the House on Friday. It is not expected to be taken up by the Senate, however, due to Republican opposition. 
Progressives have expressed frustration that the bill does not go far enough to provide aid to Americans dealing with economic fallout, while some moderates are voicing concern over the massive price tag of the plan and the fact that it does not have widespread bipartisan support. 
Freshman Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn, a moderate who flipped an Oklahoma House seat from red to blue in 2018, strongly criticized the Democratic leadership's $3 trillion coronavirus response bill on Thursday, saying that she won't vote for it.
""Messaging bills without bipartisan support are a disservice to the American people, especially during a time of crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship, this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most.""
Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman from Michigan in a swing district, told CNN on Thursday that she has ""concerns"" with the $3 trillion price tag and said ""I'm undecided"" on whether she will vote for the plan on Friday. 
Slotkin said that she's trying to weigh ""the positives for my district against some of the negatives."" 
""What I wanted to see in this package is sticking to the very specific emergency need that the country has, and so I feel like there are a lot of things that I pushed for, and I believe in, especially money for our cities and towns. There's money for testing, like really critical things, and then there are some things that I don't feel like had to be in the bill, and what I'm trying to decide is does the net positive outweigh that negative,"" she said. 
Moderate freshmen Democrats like Horn and Slotkin represent the kind of frontline, battleground districts that will be heavily contested in the fall as Republicans try to win back the House majority they lost to Democrats in 2018. 
The voices of these vulnerable Democrats carry outsized influence within the House Democratic caucus with Democratic leaders recognizing the importance of holding onto those seats to maintain their majority. 
Pelosi defended the bill against attacks that it is partisan during a press conference on Thursday, saying, ""We're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation."" 
Congressional Republicans have argued that it is too early to pass another far-reaching measure and have instead urged waiting to see what the impact will be of the already-enacted relief packages so far. 
And while GOP leaders and the White House oppose the Democratic plan, at least one House Republican intends to vote for the bill: Rep. Pete King. 
The New York Republican plans to vote for the measure, according to his spokesman Kevin Fogarty."

People are doing a lot more video conferencing now that theyre stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, conduct business with colleagues, and keep up with schoolwork. Sometimes, though, you may want to save a recording of the meeting so you can revisit it later. That could let you listen to a teachers lecture again, use the audio for a podcast, or even relive the announcement of a family pregnancy (which is something that actually happened to me on a recent family video call).
Many services offer ways to record video meetings, even on their free versions. Weve outlined here how to set up recordings for three well-known services: Zoom, Google Meet, and Skype. 
Zoom
Zoom lets you record calls whether youre a free user or a paid user. However, if youre a free user, youll only be able to save recordings to your computer. If you want to save recordings to the cloud, youll need to be on one of the companys paid offerings. Those plans start at $14.99 per user per month for its Pro plan and $1,800 per year for schools. 
Heres how to record a Zoom meeting:
<ul><li>If youre the host of your Zoom call, click the record button on the toolbar at the bottom of the call window to start the recording. If youre on a paid plan, you should see the option to pick between making a local recording or a cloud recording.</li><li>When the recording starts, youll be able to pause or stop the recording using buttons in the top left corner of your screen or on the Zoom toolbar.</li><li>If you opted for a local recording, the call will be converted into a .mp4 file and saved to your computer as soon as you end your meeting. In my testing, Zoom automatically opened the Finder window to the folder with both audio and video versions of the recording.</li><li>If you opted for a cloud recording, when you end your meeting, Zoom will show you a message saying that youll get an email when the recording is ready. For me, that email had a link to Zooms website with audio and video versions of the recording, as well as a password-protected link I could share with others so they could view and download the recording.</li></ul>Zooms website has support documents for cloud recordings, local recordings, and recording using Zooms iOS and Android apps if you want to learn more. The company also put together a helpful video that demonstrates how to record a call when youre using a computer.
Google Meet
For a limited time, anybody who is a G Suite customer should be able to record a call via Google Meet. Thats because Google has opened up free access to recording and other advanced Meet features until September 30th. After that date, video recording in Meet will presumably revert to only being available for customers of G Suite Enterprise, which costs $25 per user per month, and G Suite Enterprise for Education, which costs $48 per user per year (though Google is offering lower promotional pricing until July 31st under certain circumstances). If you plan to host video meetings via the free version of Google Meet thats rolling out over the coming weeks, though, you wont be able to make recordings, Google tells The Verge.
Heres how to record a Google Meet call. Note that I was not able to personally test these steps myself; the recording feature wasnt enabled for the G Suite account I use at work (or for the account of a colleague who has a personal G Suite account). If you dont see the recording option after following the steps below, it may not have rolled out to your account yet, or your companys G Suite settings may not let you make recordings. 
<ul><li>Once youre in the meeting, click the icon with the three vertical dots in the lower right hand of your screen. A menu will appear, and on the top of it, you should see a Record meeting option. Click that to start recording. The meeting organizer or anyone in the same organization as the host can record a meeting, according to Google.</li><li>To stop recording, click the three vertical dots again and click the Stop recording menu option at the top of the list.</li><li>Recordings will be saved to the meeting organizers Google Drive in a folder called Meet Recordings. The organizer will also receive an email with a link to the recording. If you arent the meeting organizer but activated a recording, youll also be emailed a link to the recording. A link to the recording will also be added to the calendar invite. </li></ul>Google has additional details about meeting recordings in this support document, and you can see a video about recording in Meet here.
Skype
Heres how to record a Skype call. 
<ul><li>Youll need to have at least one other person on your call to do a call recording. Once the other person has joined, you should see an option to Start Recording in the bottom left corner of your call window when you move your mouse. Either person can click on that to start a recording. </li><li>To stop recording, click the Stop recording button at the top of the screen or in the same bottom left corner of the window where the Start Recording button was.</li><li>When you end your call, youll be able to access the recording in the Skype app and download it to your computer. Recordings will be available for 30 days.</li></ul>You can also check out Microsofts support document about call recording in Skype if you want to learn more."

Google announced on Thursday that it will bring its SameSite cookie update back starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84. The update will roll out gradually to Chrome 80 and later versions.
When Chrome 80 launched in February, Google started rolling out its SameSite update, which is intended to change how cookies are handled by the browser. In April, Google announced it would be rolling back that update in order to keep essential websites working during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The update will resume starting July 14th, alongside the launch of Chrome 84
Chrome used to accept cookies by default, but with the introduction of its SameSite labeling policy, Chrome will block cookies from functioning in a third-party context, unless they carry specific labels. This is part of Chromes phased approach to privacy: this is supposed to limit which cookies collect data across sites, and in turn, limit the data those websites collect on users. 
Blocking third-party cookies can cause some websites to break, particularly during the login process, since cookies store your login information across sites and visits. Prior to Google rolling back the update, several sites had been adjusted according to the SameSite policy. However, Google said it wanted to provide stability and continuity during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially for essential services, so it decided to temporarily halt the update with the aim to resume over the summer. 
Google is taking a gradual approach to blocking third-party cookies, since Google is worried that blocking cookies could break some websites. In contrast to Safari and Firefox, which block third-party cookies by default, Chrome has decided to phase them out within two years. Following this incremental plan, earlier this month Google announced Chrome would be blocking third-party cookies in incognito mode. The Chrome team is also working on a set of alternative technologies which are intended to preserve website revenue and allow advertisers to target audiences but without breaking logins to sites or being too invasive for consumers."

Once production is fully ramped up, the company expects to print up to 3,000 parts per day.
“Formlabs’ EUA for BiPAP adapters signifies the need for these components and 3D printings' unique ability to fill that need. 3D printing enables rapid iteration and prototyping of new, innovative medical equipment, while expediting the production process, shortening supply chains, and allowing for localized manufacturing,” said Max Lobovsky, Formlabs CEO and co-founder.
Lobovsky noted that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA had only authorized a handful of EUAs. In March, Abbott received the rush-approval for its toaster-sized lab-in-a-box, and recently, NASA’s ventilator design was approved through the fast-track authorization.
While companies from Tesla to Dyson and NVIDIA have explored new ways to manufacture ventilators, pivoting manufacturing to make the devices is difficult and requires a lot of expertise. Plus, all ventilators have to clear regulatory hurdles and require creating new supply chains. Solutions like Formlabs’ adapter and right-to-repair efforts to prolong the life of existing equipment may be more practical."

On April 2, after weeks of criticism that the UK was lagging behind its European counterparts like Germany on testing, Hancock said he was ""setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.""
On Friday, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten the goal by more than 22,000.
Striking an upbeat tone, Hancock said: ""I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal."" 
Ambiguous numbers: Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to the public, but not necessarily returned. 
Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers. ""Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,"" he said.
The issue of testing didn't need to become so political. 
When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.
It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out such as rolling out a contact tracing program. 
So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time and no one can deny that more testing is a positive thing it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying."

Ai Weiwei has produced a series of face masks printed with his most iconic artworks to help counter the ""humanitarian crisis"" arising from Covid-19.
The Chinese artist, who is currently in lockdown in the UK, is hoping to raise at least $1 million for international charities that are helping vulnerable and displaced people impacted by the pandemic.
Three designs are being made available at $50 each, including works titled ""Mask with Middle Finger"" and ""Sunflower Seeds,"" a reference to the installation that saw Ai fill London's Tate Modern with over 100 million porcelain seeds. 
Many of the other designs, which can only be bought in larger sets of four or 20, allude to state control and freedom of expression, issues the dissident artist has long addressed in his work. Among them are images of handcuffs, a surveillance camera and a crab, a reference to a Chinese slang term for censorship.
Produced in collaboration with Guggenheim Museum curator Alexandra Munroe -- and printed by hand at Ai's studio in Berlin -- the items are available starting Thursday for the next month via eBay. 
The cloth masks are not for medical use, nor are they even meant to be worn. Instead, the artworks are intended to raise money for vulnerable groups, including the migrants and refugees whose plight has featured heavily in Ai's art and activism in recent years. 
All proceeds will go to the Covid-19 responses organized by Human Rights Watch, Refugees International and Médecins Sans Frontières.
For Ai, the threat to vulnerable people's livelihoods ""requires each individual to act, both alone and collectively.""
""Our small individual acts become powerful when they are part of the social response,"" he said in a media statement. ""An individual wearing a mask makes a gesture; a society wearing masks combats a deadly virus. And a society that wears masks because of the choices of individuals, rather than because of the directive of authorities, can defy and withstand any force.
""No will is too small, and no act is too helpless,"" he added.
In a press release, Human Rights Watch's executive director Kenneth Roth described the project as ""a powerful example of art and activism coming together for good,"" while Refugees International president Eric Schwartz called it a ""noble initiative"" that ""sounds the alarm"" on the threat the pandemic poses to displaced people. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, warned on Tuesday that urban refugees in Africa are among those struggling to meet basic needs due to the economic impact of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns.
Ai has also been outspoken about the pandemic's political implications -- especially in China, where he was frequently subjected to police harassment and detention before entering self-exile in Germany in 2015. 
He has since moved to Cambridge, UK. In an interview with CNN Style last month, he expressed concern that the country's government is using its response to the virus to strengthen what he calls its ""police state.""
""For China, everything is for political use,"" Ai said, adding: ""It doesn't matter what kind of disaster they're facing. The only thing they learn is how well they use this authoritarian power to manipulate the story.""
The artist also revealed that he is producing a documentary about the pandemic, and has been working remotely with film crews in Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged.
Ai is not the only artist to turn his hand to mask-making in recent weeks. Takashi Murakami, who is known for his work with the likes of Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, has just released a series of face coverings featuring his signature flower motif, among other designs.
In the UK, a group of four renowned artists -- David Shrigley, Yinka Shonibare, Eddie Peake and Linder Sterling -- last week unveiled a series of limited edition masks. Money raised by their designs will go to the Contemporary Art Society's Rapid Response Fund, which offers financial support to artists and museums affected by coronavirus lockdowns.

9,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Scottie Andrew, CNN",This is the coronavirus' staggering toll in the US,How do you calculate the cost of an American tragedy? These numbers show just how drastically the Covid-19 pandemic has blown up life in the US.,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/us-coronavirus-toll-in-numbers-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200527111957-coronavirus-toll-numbers-v02-super-tease.jpg,2020-05-27T22:43:03Z,"(CNN)How do you calculate the cost of an American tragedy?
It's difficult to comprehend just how drastically the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted life in the US when its effects are so wide-reaching. Unemployment has soared to levels not seen in decades. The virus is ravaging African American and Latino communities. And daily life as we knew it is on indefinite pause. 
The following figures make those consequences clearer. Here, in dollars, percentages and -- most tragically -- lives, is the devastating toll the pandemic has taken on the US. 
The virus has killed more than 100,000 Americans
Coronavirus has now killed at least 100,000 people in the US since the first death was reported in February, according to Johns Hopkins University's case count. That's an average of nearly 900 deaths per day. 
Nearly 80% of all deaths occur in people over 65
Older adults are exceedingly vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus. And according to CDC data, that risk increases with age. 
About 59% of all coronavirus deaths occur in people 75 and older, according to the CDC, which relies on less complete data than the Johns Hopkins University count. 
21% occur in people between 65 and 74, and roughly 18% occur in people ages 45 to 64. Just 3% of deaths occur in 18- to 44-year-olds. 
The US leads the world in cases and deaths 
The US death rate is 2.6 times higher than the second leading country, the United Kingdom. The UK has reported 36,875 deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University's global case count.
Both the US and the UK have heard mixed messages from leadership. President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the virus and ceded decisions about closing and reopening to the states. 
In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new message of ""Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"" has confused leaders of the three other nations in the UK, who aren't sure whether the guidance applies to them or just Britain. 
Nearly as many Americans have died of Covid-19 as in the wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan combined
More than 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam. The US coronavirus death rate is 1.7 times higher. 
Almost 37,000 Americans died in Korea. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 3 times higher. 
4,431 Americans died in Iraq. The US coronavirus death rate is 22 times higher. 
2,445 Americans died in Afghanistan. The US coronavirus death rate is nearly 40 times higher. 
And by June more Americans will have likely died of coronavirus than in all four of those conflicts combined. 
Nursing homes account for 42% of deaths in most of the US
More than 35,100 nursing home deaths have been reported in 37 states, out of 174,381 cases in 42 states, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Not all states are reporting infections and deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, so these numbers may be higher on a national scale. 
With their highly vulnerable residents, frequent visitors and relatively close quarters, nursing homes are hotbeds for infection. The first significant coronavirus outbreak in the US occurred at a facility in Washington state, where at least 35 people died and dozens more residents and staff were infected.
Black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to die from the virus
Black Americans represent 13% of the population in the 40 states plus DC that have released mortality data, but they account for 25% of deaths, according to an analysis from the American Public Media (APM) Research Lab. 
At least 20,195 black Americans have died from coronavirus as of May 19, APM reported. That's roughly equivalent to 1 in 2,000 black Americans dying. 
""If they had died of Covid-19 at the same rate as white Americans, about 12,000 black Americans, 1,300 Latino Americans and 300 Asian Americans would still be alive,"" the lab said.
By comparison, white Americans, who make up 61.7% of the states that have released race mortality data, account for 49.3% of all deaths in those states. In all, white people represent 21 in 100,00 deaths. 
The Navajo Nation has the nation's highest per-capita infection rate
Data on Covid-19's impact on indigenous people is incomplete, but the numbers that do exist are bleak. 
The Navajo Nation has a population of 173,667 spread out across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. With 4,002 cases, the Navajo territory has 2,304 cases per 100,000 people. 
That's more than densely populated New York and New Jersey, which report 1,806 and 1,668 cases per 100,000 people respectively. 
In Arizona, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 5 times higher than the rate for all other groups. In New Mexico, the indigenous mortality rate is more than 7 times higher. 
More than 41% of US deaths have occurred in New York and New Jersey
The two states have seen a combined 40,279 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's count. That's more than 41% of the 97,722 deaths reported as of Monday. 
New York has reported 29,350 deaths, and 11,339 people have died in New Jersey. 
The epicenter of the country's outbreak is New York City, the most populous city in the US with 8 million residents. It's also got the country's highest population density, with 27,000 people per square mile. That, coupled with a subway system that sees 5.5 million commuters daily, make it prime breeding ground for infection.
New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, is home to hundreds of thousands of commuters who worked in the city before the pandemic hit. Plus, it has the highest population density of any state. 
Coronavirus is 2 to 3 times more contagious than the flu
A person with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people. But without mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders, a person with novel coronavirus infects an average of 2 to 3 other people. 
Researchers say the US could have prevented 84% of its deaths
If the US had locked down two weeks earlier than it did in late March and early April, 82% of its cases and 84% of its deaths could've been avoided, according to Columbia University researchers.
And if states took social distancing measures just one week earlier, more than half the number of deaths and infections would've been prevented, the researchers said.
Without a coordinated national effort, states issued stay-at-home orders on a rolling basis over two weeks. California locked down on March 20 while Florida, after pressure from lawmakers, locked down almost two weeks later. A few states, like Arkansas, never enforced a statewide stay-at-home order. 
The US still predicts up to 240,000 deaths in the first wave
Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House's coronavirus task force told Fox's Chris Wallace on Sunday that she stands by the original model, which predicted anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. At the beginning of May, Trump said he predicted 80,000 to 90,000 deaths, which the US has already exceeded. 
A second peak may follow the first wave with an even higher death toll, the World Health Organization warned Monday.
Countries must be prepared that the virus could ""jump up at any time,"" and another peak could likely occur during flu season, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. 
The US needs to test 900,000 people every day to reopen, a study says
There were 378,908 new Covid-19 tests reported on Sunday, according to the Atlantic's Covid-19 Tracking Project. That's a significant uptick since March 24, when states conducted 68,454 tests. But it's still not enough to safely reopen, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. 
In early May the institute said the US should test at least 900,000 people every day by May 15. 
Though testing access has improved considerably since the start of the pandemic, faulty tests issued by the CDC are thought to have contributed to the slow US response to the virus. Still, the responsibility to ramp up testing falls to the states, per the Trump administration's latest testing report. 
The US economy had its worst quarter since the 2008 recession
America's first-quarter GDP, the most expansive measure of the US economy, fell at a 4.8% annualized rate, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in May. 
It was the first contraction of the US economy since the first quarter of 2014, and the worst drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
43 states reported record unemployment in May
Nevada's unemployment rate is the worst in the country at 28.2%, significantly higher than its rate of 6.9% in March. Michigan and Hawaii had the next highest unemployment rates at 22.7% and 22.3%, respectively.
Things may get even worse. US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin told Fox News' Chris Wallace that the US could get close to jobless rates not seen since the Great Depression, when unemployment peaked at 25%. 
Grocery prices have risen as much as 16%
Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April. That was the biggest increase from one month to the next since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Egg prices shot up 16.1% in April. Cookies cost 5.1% more in April, too. Chicken is 5.8% more expensive, and orange prices rose 5.6%. 
It's because of disruptions in the food supply chain. Restaurants shut down, more Americans started cooking at home and more people started buying groceries, though food producers couldn't speed up their deliveries at the same rate.

""This is the first major look at Covid-19 infections among healthy young adults that the CDC has released,"" said Daniel Payne, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collaborated with the US Navy on the investigation.
More than 1,000 of the ship's nearly 4,900-member crew tested positive for Covid-19 following the outbreak. After spending weeks at a port in Guam, the ship returned to sea last month.
The majority -- nearly 60% -- of sailors in the study who had antibodies had neutralizing ones, ""a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity,"" the researchers wrote.
Most reported mild or no symptoms, and those who took preventive measures -- such as face masks and social distancing -- were less likely to become infected.
""What we saw was that most of the infections were actually mild, in addition to those that were asymptomatic,"" Payne told reporters Tuesday.
""And this is perhaps different from studies of older Americans, or maybe even those who were hospitalized already, and certainly much different from those with underlying health conditions.""
With a number of young people reporting mild, atypical, or no symptoms from the virus, ""symptom-based surveillance might not detect all infections,"" the investigators wrote.
Most tested positive for antibodies
The report, published Tuesday, included a sample of 382 service members, with a median age of 30. According to the report, three-fourths were male. 
Nearly 60% of them tested positive for antibodies, and among them, 59% had also developed neutralizing antibodies by the time their blood samples were taken. 
Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, potentially disabling it from attacking human cells. In a handful of participants, these antibodies were detected more than 40 days after their symptoms began.
However, because the data come from a single point in time, they note that longer studies will be needed to definitively show whether and how long these antibodies might protect against the virus.
Lower infection rate in those who took protective measures
Those who took preventive measures were also less likely to become infected. 
Sailors who wore face coverings were less likely to become infected (55.8% versus 80.8%), as were those who avoided common areas (53.8% versus 67.5%) and practiced physical distancing (54.7% versus 70.0%). 
Symptoms more closely associated with Covid-19 in this sample were loss of taste or smell, muscle pain, fever and chills. 
Two were hospitalized among the 238 in the study confirmed to have been infected with the virus.
Officials are working to ""tailor our public health practices to the unique characteristics of this adversary whose secret weapon, as you know, is the ability to be transmitted by an individual before they know they're infected,"" Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, the US Navy surgeon general, told reporters Tuesday.

More than 2 million Americans struggle with opioid use disorder, and about 130 Americans on average die every day from an opioid overdose. Opioids account for a majority of drug overdose deaths, the leading cause of accidental death in the US. It's a crisis that's been a priority for officials at the federal, state and local levels for years.
Now, the coronavirus has disrupted all matters of life across the country -- including efforts to combat the nation's opioid problem.
Walk-in clinics and syringe exchange programs have been closed. Community support groups are meetingvirtually. 
Some who struggle with substance abuse are homeless or incarcerated and can't comply with social distancing guidelines, while those who can are left isolated and at risk. On top of all that, the pandemic is causing massive stress -- a primary driver of relapse. 
""This changing, very strange world that we're living through could serve as a trigger for people to return to drug use,"" said Daliah Heller, director of drug use initiatives at the public health organization Vital Strategies. ""And that brings a great potential for overdose with it.""
As local officials report spikes in overdose calls and deaths, experts and advocates say they're concerned the coronavirus pandemic is making an already serious problem worse.
Local officials are reporting overdose spikes
County coroners, law enforcement and emergency responders around the country are reporting spikes in overdose calls and deaths -- and they're concerned that's connected to Covid-19.
Franklin County, Ohio, reported 28 non-fatal overdoses from last Friday night to Saturday night. The previous Friday, the county had six overdose deaths, which coroner Anahi Ortiz had described as a ""surge"" in a Facebook post.
Ortiz wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that Franklin County had seen a 50% increase in fatal overdoses from January to April 15.Sixty-two people died of overdoses in the month of April alone, she wrote.
Niagara County in New York reported last month that drug overdoses spiked 35% from January 1 to April 6, compared to the same time last year.
And in Jacksonville, Florida, the fire and rescue chief said the city saw a 20% increase in overdose calls from February to March.
It's too soon to determine whether such reports are evidence of a larger trend, said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Federal and state data on fatal and non-fatal overdoses for the past few months are not yet available, while coroners and medical examiners are overwhelmed with cases of Covid-19 and may not have the resources to follow up on overdose deaths, she said.
""We do not know,"" Volkow said, of whether more people are overdosing in connection with Covid-19. ""In many cases, we will likely never know.""
But she predicts that some communities will ""absolutely"" see an uptick in overdoses.
Public health services are disrupted
There are a few reasons that experts are concerned about a potential coronavirus-related increase in opioid overdoses.
For one, harm reduction programs across the country have beenexperiencing reduced capacity given the pandemic, Heller said.
Though many states have defined such services as essential in their stay-at-home orders, some programs have had to restrict access or reduce staffing because of a lack of funding or personal protective equipment for their workers.
Federal agencies have eased some regulations that have mitigated the risks of overdoses and Covid-19 infection, Heller said.
For example, patients receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder often have to visit a provider daily for a dose of methadone. But because such visits could expose both patients and health care workers to Covid-19, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is temporarily allowing treatment programs to provide patients with two to four weeks' worth of methadone doses to take home. 
Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has also relaxed telehealth restrictions around prescriptions for buprenorphine, another medication-assisted treatment.
Still, for people who lack health insurance or high-speed internet access, there are barriers.
People are engaging risky behaviors
In some communities, services that treat addiction or prevent overdoses, such as needle exchange programs, are on hold -- leading people to engage in risky behaviors. 
Jamie Favaro is the founder of Next Distro, a harm reduction organization that provides syringes and the overdose-reversing naloxone online and through the mail. She said her organization is receiving about five times as many requests as usual because people haven't had access to sterile syringes. A significant volume of requests is coming from people in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, she said.
Recently, she said, a client in West Virginia requested syringes after sharing a single needle with three other people for a week. The exchange programs in their area were shut down, the client said, and there was nowhere else to get syringes. Other clients have reached out saying they are also reusing syringes or have had needles break off in their skin, she said.
""I'm very fearful that we're going to see an HIV spike and a Hepatitis C spike, as well as an overdose spike in areas where the needle exchange programs have shut down,"" Favaro said.
More harm reduction programs around the country are beginning to mail syringes and naloxone to people who use opioids, Favaro added. County health departments are ramping up naloxonedistribution to protect against overdoses too.
But the coronavirus pandemic presents challenges there as well.
When someone overdoses on opioids, another person generally administers naloxone to reverse those effects. Because of social distancing, Volkow said, it's possible that some individuals may not have anyone else around to administer the life-saving medication.
The drug supply is affected
Another reason people are at heightened risk of opioid overdoses has to do with how Covid-19 has affected the nation's illicit drug supply, experts say.
Illegal drugs are typically smuggled into the US from other countries, but border restrictions brought on by the pandemic could theoretically decrease drug access in some areas, Volkow said.
On the surface, Heller said, that might seem like a good thing. But a limited supply could drive dealers to increase the potency of products to meet demand, mixing powerful, synthetic opioids like fentanyl into drugs and putting those who use them at a greater risk of overdose. 
Less access to drugs could also drive users to seek out other, unfamiliar drug sources -- or risk withdrawal.
Stress could drive people to relapse
Finally, the social isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is leaving people especially vulnerable.
Some support groups for people experiencing opioid addiction or for those in recovery are now taking place over Zoom, Volkow said. But the virtual contact often just isn't the same. 
""One of the most powerful interventions is to keep people in treatment is that social network,"" she said. ""Isolation can lead you to seek out some relief, like starting to take drugs.""
It will be a while before we know the true effects that Covid-19 has had on those who struggle with opioid use disorders, Volkow said. But already, there are many reasons to worry."

First it's important to understand how the virus attacks our lungs. When people are infected, the virus travels to the mucus membranes and then the lungs. To control the infection, the body responds with inflammation in the lungs. And this inflammation prevents the lungs from being able to oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide, which leads the patient to gasp for air andsuffer more serious illness. 
But there are things you can do to improve respiratory health, just by changing a few lifestyle factors, according to Dr. Robert Eitches, an allergist and immunologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Enhancing your respiratory healthdoesn't prevent you from getting infected, he said. But itdoes have benefits that may reduce the severity of the illness if you are infected, and therefore your exposure to the virus. 
Here's how you can strengthen your body's respiratory capacity so that if you do get infected with coronavirus, the chances of serious illness may be lower. 
One of the most important steps to improving your respiratory health is avoiding anything that impairs lung function, such as smoking cigarettes and vaping, Eitches said. 
Smoking and vaping cause irritation in the lung airways that leads to permanent, adverse effects on lung function by destroying lung tissue where air exchange occurs. 
""Smoke is composed of small particles; when inhaled, the particles get stuck in the lungs,"" Eitches said. ""This begins a vicious cycle of permanent lung damage."" 
Both activities can also suppress the immune system, which you need to be able to help fight infections. 
Dr. Ryan Steele, an allergist-immunologist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, cautioned against smoking marijuana, too. 
""Even though there's a lot of controversy around the benefits of the drug, anything that you are inhaling into your lungs that's a combustible product will certainly increase the stress on your lungs and the level of inflammation,"" he said. ""Even if it's for medical purposes, you want to be careful with anything that you're igniting and inhaling into your lungs at this point."" 
Two other potentially harmful behaviors are sitting by the fireplace or lit candles, Eitches said. This might be a bummer since both of those activities are relaxing. But similar to smoking or vaping, a fireplace -- especially a wood-burning fireplace -- ""emits smoke into the environment, which you would then inhale and then deposit into your chest,"" he said. 
Many candles have metal wicks, which are vaporized along with smoke and can cause similar lung damage. 
Exercise can improve respiratory capacity, or breathing ability. Alveoli are tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs arranged in clusters throughout the lungs. They're integral to the respiratory system, as they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the bloodstream. 
When a person is sedentary, Steele said, that results in a phenomenon called ""atelectasis,"" when the lung sacs don't have enough air and collapse slightly. To improve the lung sac capacity, people have to ""breathe against resistance,"" he added. 
""You can think of it like a partially deflated balloon,"" he suggested. ""And what's the way that you keep the air inside a balloon? You tie a knot in it to increase the resistance, so the air has to work harder to get out."" 
By breathing against resistance when exercising, you're ""actually helping to expand and keep open the air sacs"" in your lungs, Steele said. 
In addition to cardio, yoga and stretching, breathing exercises such as pursed lip breathing and deep yogic nasal breathing can help and are easy to do wherever you are, Eitches suggested. Pursed lip breathing is when you take in a deep breath with your mouth, close your lips, then exhale through them as if you're blowing up a balloon. There are similar benefits from deep yogic nasal breathing as you filter the air through your nose. 
Improving your lung function means ""you would be less likely to hit a critically low lung function state, which would in turn cause you to not be able to oxygenate your blood,"" Eitches said. 
""Respirators essentially breathe for you to try to push open your airways. These exercises will teach you how to fight off the respiratory side effects [of Covid-19] on your own."" 
Additionally, Steele said, exercise decreases inflammation in the body and can reduce the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious complication in some patients hospitalized with Covid-19. 
Reduce excess mucus buildup
""Mucus is naturally occurring in our bodies, and it provides a very important function to maintain good health in our respiratory tract,"" Steele said. ""It helps to capture [allergens, bacteria and viruses].""
In our respiratory tract, we have little hairs called cilia that move those threats out of our tract. We swallow the majority of mucus, Steele said, but when we have thingsthat irritate our nasal passages, we can produce too much mucus and be unable to clear it. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses, and blocks oxygen from entering and leaving the pathways of the lungs. 
We also have mucus in our lungs. People with asthma produce too much mucus, which can predispose them to blockages and inflammation in their airways, Steele said.
There may be a connection between diet and mucus buildup. ""Some people believe that inflammatory foods such as milk and wheat increase mucus production,"" Eitches said. ""Another school of thought that I have seen to work both anecdotally with my patients and with myself is eating spicy foods.""
Spicy foods that have capsaicin -- chiles, jalapenos, cayenne, hot sauce -- can thin mucus and allow it to be coughed out. 
There are a few methods for controlling excess mucus: You could try a saline nasal spray if you have allergies. People with asthma can use their inhalers to decrease inflammation, which reduces mucus. Taking a hot shower or boiling hot water to make a hot towel compress may also work, as the steam mixes with mucus to thin it out. 
""[Mucus] is something where if you have too little, it's bad because we can get infections,"" Steele said. ""If you have too much, it can block your ability to breathe and also increase infection. So you want just the right amount."" 
Minimize exposure to allergens
Spending more time indoors during the pandemic means we're increasingly exposed to indoor dust. And since it is now spring, there's pollen everywhere. 
Both can set off allergies and asthma, Eitches said, and we need a functioning nose to get clean air into our chest airways. 
""When you are allergic, you get swelling of the inner nose tissue and excess mucus production,"" he added. ""When you are unable to breathe from your nose, you switch from nasal breathing to mouth breathing. The lungs want warm, clean, humidified air from the nose -- the air it cannot get from the mouth.""
Managing dust via cleaning and an air filter, and managing pollen allergies with medication, can help avoid having to rub or blow your nose to open it up -- If your hands are unclean, you risk becoming infected with the virus. 
For dust, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter would help to remove the majority of allergens from the air, Steele said. Air conditioning registers also need to be cleaned. When pets go outside, wipe them off before they come in the house to rid them of any pollen. 
If people practice these techniques, they may have a milder course of illness if infected with coronavirus, Eitches said. 
""These suggestions have immediate benefit, but don't expect to see dramatic results overnight,"" he added. ""Your body will be subtly improved, and your body will be able to handle coronavirus and other infections.""
Taking steps to improve respiratory health is another tool to add to one's prevention kit, as we weather the pandemic and anticipate another possible wave in the fall. 
""The stronger your baseline health, the stronger your body will be to fight off infections,"" Eitches said. ""It's like having the appropriate ammunition to fight a war.""

Florida has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,"" and risks being the ""worst it has ever been,"" according to Wednesday's projections from a model put together by a team of scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
The state joins nine others -- Alabama, Arizona, California, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas -- that are seeing record-high seven-day averages of new coronavirus cases per day, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. 
Twenty-one states are seeing an upward trend in new coronavirus cases and health experts continue to stress the importance of taking precautions to mitigate the virus's spread. Despite the rising number of cases, the White House has downplayed the risks, with President Donald Trump saying in an interview with Gray TV on Wednesday that the virus is ""dying out.""
At the same time that the White House narrative is at odds with the data, health experts including Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci have been absent from many public updates. Dr. Johnathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN's Erin Burnett it's because ""they tell the truth.""
""And the truth is that the pandemic is still very, very active in the United States and that we're not getting back to normal and there are difficult things that the public has to do,"" Reiner said. 
According to data from Johns Hopkins University:
 21 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Oregon, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
 Eight states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah and Washington.
 21 states are seeing a downward trend: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.
 One state, Vermont, has seen a decrease of at least 50%.
Nationwide, more than 2 million people have been infected and 117,717 people have died of the virus.
Officials downplay record cases
On Wednesday, the virus claimed 755 lives in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
State officials are navigating the outbreak and managing the rising number of infections on their own.
Los Angeles County, which accounts for almost half of California's cases, on Wednesday reported another single-day high of new cases. But officials attributed the county's increase to a lag in test reports.
Other politicians have also attributed higher case numbers to increased testing, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said surges are outpacing testing.
'When you see 50% or 150% increase in the number of cases you are seeing -- which is what we are seeing across the South -- that's not testing. That's new cases. That's community spread,"" he said.
Texas also reported a record-high number of daily Covid-19 hospitalizations on Monday, with 2,326.
Florida recorded almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases also on Monday -- its highest number of new and confirmed cases in a single day, according to the Florida Department of Health.
But Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state will not shut down.
The governor attributed the spike in cases to increased testing as well as outbreaks in prisons, agricultural communities and long-term care facilities.
Alabama and Arizona join calls for mask mandates
Some local officials are hoping to manage the spread by mandating mask usage.
A day after the city council failed to pass an ordinance, Montgomery, Alabama, Mayor Steven Reed implemented an executive order Wednesday requiring those in the city to wear face masks and coverings, according to a post from the city's official Twitter account.
Arizona physicians have called upon Gov. Doug Ducey to implement a similar executive order statewide. While the governor announced Wednesday that he would be calling upon 300 National Guard soldiers to help with contact tracing, he said he would leave mask requirement decisions to mayors.
Some local leaders are unlikely to follow what he called ""a self-defeating executive order,"" he said.
Earlier this week, nine Texas mayors, including those in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have
 urged Gov. Greg Abbott to give them the authority to require masks be worn in public ""where physical distancing cannot be practiced.""
The mayors and physicians have reason to believe the requirements could be effective. A study reported Tuesday found that an estimated 230,000 to 450,000 cases of the virus were prevented in states that required mask use between April 8 and May 15.
Large events yield positive coronavirus tests
Loosening precautions and restrictions means more people are gathering in larger groups, which has in some cases swiftly resulted in positive coronavirus tests.
Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb announced Wednesday that he tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-quarantining for at least 14 days. He said it is ""likely"" that he came into contact with an infected person at a campaign event he held on Saturday. 
The county Public Health Department is working to track everyone he came into contact with, he said on Facebook.
Earlier this week, a group of 16 friends in Florida, said they all became infected with coronavirus after a night out at a recently reopened bar.
Still, Oklahoma, one of the states reporting a record-setting number of new cases, is scheduled later this week to host a campaign rally for Trump. 
When questioned, Trump said he was not worried about attendees getting sick.""Actually, Oklahoma has had a very low rate relatively speaking. It is a little spike, a small spike for a specific reason,"" he said. ""We'll go there, everyone is going to be safe.""
Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma acknowledged the rise in rates to CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday, but said the rally should not be postponed and ""we are pushing people to be attentive on this.""
CNN's Nikki Carvajal, Shelby Lin Erdman, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup, Pierre Meilhan, Jamiel Lynch, and Holly Yan contributed to this report."

The World Health Organization reports that coronavirus pathogens can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours. In other words, we need to stop touching things and keep washing our hands. But naturally, that's easier said than done. You can't really avoid door handles, elevator buttons, or punching your PIN into the card reader at the grocery store. That's where the inspiration came from for StatGear's Hygiene Hand, which has raised more than $580,000 on Kickstarter in the last month.
We know what you're thinking this thing looks weirdly familiar. And yes, while we did indeed feature a similar product recently, it was such a hit that we went looking for alternatives. And here's the main difference: Hygiene Hand is an everyday carry tool designed by an actual NYC paramedic to help reduce the number of things you have to touch every day. Plus, unlike the extremely similar CleanKey, this one's made in the USA and will ship faster, meaning you won't have to wait as long to brave the grocery store with some added safety measures. 
Hygiene Hand is made from brass with 70% copper and features a large loop to slip your finger into for leverage. It's designed to hook onto round handles, so you can open and close doors without touching them, and also works as a stylus in place of your finger. The flat tip is safe to use on phones, ATM screens, point of sale machines, and more.
Even though the Hygiene Hand helps you live a more germ-conscious lifestyle, you should still wash your hands and wear a mask in shared spaces, as per the CDC. It's not magic, but it will make your life a little safer and healthier. Just clip it on your keychain and start navigating your way through the grocery store, bank, or pharmacy without touching things.
The Kickstarter campaign surpassed its initial $5,000 goal by an astronomical amount. Get on board and grab yourself one for just $19.99, which is 20% off retail value."

I'm talking, of course, about The Office's Michael Scott.
But before we move to Scranton, first Trump.  He really got lost in a morass of negative vs. positive when trying to explain that his health was fine.
""I tested very positively, in another sense,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""I tested positively toward negative, right? I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning: I tested negative.""
Here is a quote from Trump:
""I tested very positively in another sense so this morning. Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right. So. I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning I tested negative."" pic.twitter.com/xA0DBUcfr9
 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 21, 2020
The comments from Trump are reminiscent of Scott played by Steve Carell in the Season 2 episode of the iconic sitcom titled ""Michael's Birthday."" In the episode, accountant Kevin Malone is waiting to hear back from a doctor about whether he has skin cancer. 
Michael, ever self-centered, is frustrated that folks are lavishing attention on Kevin on his birthday. Later, at an ice-skating rink which Michael had gotten himself for his birthday Kevin gets the news that his tests came back negative. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief, except Michael. He stomps angrily, rips of his (faux) Livestrong bracelet, and tells Kev ""we're gonna beat this."" 
SEE ALSO: Which 'Office' characters would make the best quarantine buddies? We figured it out.
The scene then cuts to Michael, trying to explain away his idiocy. 
""Well, apparently, in the medicine community, negative means good,"" he tells the camera. ""Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would be chaos."" 
As Mashable's Nicole Gallucci wrote in 2018, the Scott and Trump similarities have come up pretty much since day one of his presidency. The character even had a Trump business book in his office. 
Whether it's positive or negative to have your leadership compared to Michael Gary Scott's, well that's anybody's guess."

Contact tracing is when health officials get in touch with the people whom a person who has tested positive for coronavirus has come in contact with. They then check if they are symptomatic, and often request that they self-quarantine. It's a leading method for preventing outbreaks.
We now have more information about how, in a city of 8.5 million, it will all technically work.
NYC has tapped a tech company called Twilio for the job. Twilio is a ""cloud communications"" company, which means it provides all sorts of digital communication tools behind the scenes like marketing text messages, customer service chats and calls, and status updates to other companies. You know when you get those texts about when your Uber driver is arriving? That's powered by Twilio.
The city plans to use Twilio's customizable ""flex"" program for its cloud-based contact center, which basically means it'll use Twilio's servers and software to keep track of individuals and power its communications efforts. When the city's contact tracers get in touch with someone, they'll be doing it through Twilio's text and voice platforms. 
Contact tracers will send out educational information and requests for people to self-report on their symptoms and contacts. The program, and partnership with Twilio, runs through the city's Department of Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications (DoITT). Twilio couldn't speak to how NYC specifically would use the platform, but provided a framework for what their contact tracing operation looks like. Here's their step by step explanation (edited for length and clarity by Mashable).
<ol><li>Twilio's cloud contact center gets integrated with a database of patient data. 
</li><li>A contact tracer will click into a patients record in their database to automatically trigger a call to connect them to a COVID-19 infected patient (through Twilio).
</li><li>The contact tracer will educate the patient about COVID-19 and ask them who theyve been in contact with recently who may have been exposed to the virus. Scripts vary based on the type of patient. 
</li><li>Then, the contact tracer places additional phone calls to all exposed individuals letting them know what precautions they should take now. Contact tracers do not reveal the identity of the patient who exposed these contacts.
</li><li>Once contact tracers have called patients and notified contacts, they then put the individuals in an automated set of text messages for 14 days. Patients and contacts get daily reminders via text to click through to a symptom survey where they report on how they are doing.
</li></ol>With so much sensitive health information passing through Twilio, privacy is certainly something to pay attention to. Twilio says that it is a ""non-location based, HIPAA compliant contact tracing solution."" It also clarified that ""the government agencies deploying contact tracing solutions control the collection and storage of data,"" not Twilio.
Earlier in May, the city and states of New York announced that they would hire ""thousands"" of contact tracers. Contact tracers can be people with healthcare experience, but the government is also accepting applications from people who take an online course and pass with an 85 percent or above. The Guardian reports that the course had over 150,000 enrollments in its first week, and that NYC has already had 10,000 people apply for the job.
Twilio runs the communications of some of the most prominent tech companies in the biz, including both Uber and Lyft, Airbnb, Instacart, Netflix and too many other household names to list. Since getting a functional contact tracing operation up and running in New York City is going to be a tremendous challenge, it's encouraging that the city has tapped such a major player. Now, it'll be up to New Yorkers to actually answer the phone."

With most of the city on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, it might feel like all that the city has to offer is off limits. Torontos people and businesses are resilient and creative, though. They have found innovative ways to offer their services while the city moves toward lifting restrictions. 
With things slowly beginning to open up again, including patios at 50 percent capacity, we can look forward to getting back to some of our favourite venues and activities. Until then, whether you are a quarantined at home or heading out in small groups to socialize at a distance, weve got a list of 10 ways to have fun in Toronto while your life is still somewhat on lockdown. 
Get your culture on with Torontos galleries and museums
Check out the exciting virtual exhibits, hang out in online chats, attend concerts and workshops, and just enjoy the free access to many of Torontos galleries and museums.
On March 27, the Art Gallery of Ontario launched AGO from Home, a way to engage with art, and the AGO team virtually, through interesting and diverse stories, videos and closer looks at artwork, as well as some DIY and How-To videos. Check out their website for upcoming events or enjoy their online collections anytime.
Although Artscape has temporarily closed its community cultural hub facilities to the public and cancelled all Artscape-led in-person programming, you can still attend their free virtual programming through Launchpad Learning Online. Hour-long zoom meetings cover topics like building your brand online and the art of storytelling. See Whats On.
Enjoy the splendour of the Aga Khan Museum without leaving your couch. The #MuseumWithoutWalls campaign gives you the chance to tour the collections, watch concerts and performances, and engage with ideas through videos, Q&amp;As, and interactive experiences.
Take a virtual tour of The Power Plant and view their latest exhibitions. The Power Plant also has an online hub for original writing, video and other content related to their programming and the field of contemporary art more broadly called Switch On. 
Take in the beauty of Torontos parks and gardens
Torontos many parks and gardens provide a refreshing escape from the confines of your home. From the beauty of its lakes and rivers to its ravine systems and trails, there are plenty of natural attractions to see and experience in Toronto while keeping a safe social distance. 
Toronto Botanical Garden offers four acres of award-winning themed gardens adjacent to Wilket Creek, Don Valley Ravine and Edwards Gardens. Although tours and events are temporarily suspended, you can enjoy the beauty of nature and wide-open space.
High Park is a 161-hectare park along Torontos Lakeshore. It offers trails, paved roads, sidewalks and benches for a walk, a hike, a ride or to sit and enjoy the fresh air and open space all day long. The park is usually pretty quiet in the mornings but starts to pick up in the afternoon. 
Rouge Park offers a selection of trails featuring rare forests, restored wetlands, and stunning fall colours. Popular activities include hiking, bird-watching and fall photography. Winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.
Let Toronto entertain you
Toronto is home to many innovative and acclaimed music, theatre and dance companies. The pandemic has created new opportunities for the public to access their art and engage with the artists that will delight and amuse.
Musicians from your Toronto Symphony Orchestra continue to make magical musical moments from home as an expression of their commitment to you. Youll discover live performances, interviews, virtual concerts, and more on the TSO Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
The Canadian Opera Company  cancelled the 2019/2020 concert season, but in the meantime, you can visit their Facebook page where they will share music and videos from classical artists to keep us connected and uplifted.
Mirvish Productions has introduced a weekly online show called ""Check In From Away."" Each week they speak with different Toronto Theatre personalities to bring you both stories from the stage and happenings from home. New episodes are released every Tuesday on their YouTube channel. 
Bonus tip
Sometimes all you really need to have fun is your favourite show to binge watch and some good eats. With current affairs as they are, its a safe and familiar way to comfort yourself. Weve got a suggestion to make it a little more affordable while helping you manage your finances. 
Paytm, the free mobile payment app makes it easy to set up automatic payments for hundreds of payees through the mobile app using a variety of methods including using Paytm Cash, Credit Cards, Debit Cards or your Linked Bank Account so you never miss a payment.

In honor of the first responders on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, Funko is excited to announce the new line of Pop! Heroes to commemorate the nurses and doctors who are giving their all to help treat patients, the company said in a statement.
However, even more important than the figures is the donation Funko announced alongside them. The company says it has made a donation to the 501c U.S. non-profit GlobalGiving, which connects nonprofits with donors and companies around the world in order to provide them with the tools they need.

The new Funko Pop line consists of two male and two female hospital workers. Each will retail for $10.99. Pre-orders

Toward the end of the discussion with restaurant executives and other members of the industry, the president casually dropped that he's been taking the drug (which is used to treat malaria, lupus, and arthritis) for ""about a week and a half."" 
""I'm still here,"" he continued.
When pressed on whether there was evidence that taking the drug has a preventative effect, Trump said he's received ""a lot of positive calls about it.""   
He also dismissed recent studies that concluded that hydroxychloroquine wasn't an effective COVID-19 treatment. 
One, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, studied 1,438 COVID-19 patients across 25 New York hospitals. That study concluded that among hospitalized patients, using the drug ""was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality."" Another observational study published by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center followed 1,376 coronavirus patients at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and similarly concluded that ""the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower"" among those who received the treatment than those who did not. 
Trump claimed that the patients who were treated using hydroxychloroquine didn't experience better results or any, for that matter were already in ""extraordinarily bad condition."" 
Whether he's actually taking the drug or just said he was to get a rise out of reporters remains to be seen. Trump and other right-wing pundits have been pushing hydroxychloroquine use for weeks, and desperate Americans have been buying up the country's supply. Those who do need the drug to treat autoimmune conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are struggling to access it. 
The excitement about the reveal: I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this. When I announced this. Yeah, I've taken it for 1 and a half weeks now. And I'm still here. I'm still here, Trump said.

Taking the drug can cause dizziness, nausea, hair loss, and ringing in the ears. More serious side effects include uncontrolled movement, loss of balance, and, in severe cases, seizures. Most doctors have concluded that it's not worth taking it until more controlled clinical trials that can prove its effectiveness. Until then, keep social distancing and washing your hands."

NYC's Department of Health refreshed the guidelines over the weekend, and the new version has got plenty of gems.
Again, NYC says that you are your safest partner, meaning that masturbation is the best option for those living alone. The good news is that they've answered the question of whether sex with other people is allowed with a resounding ""Yes!"" but you do need to dive into the fine print. 
The city advises you to ask some questions before having sex with anyone outside your household: Do they have COVID symptoms, or have they had symptoms in the past 14 days? Have they been diagnosed?
SEE ALSO: How single people are dealing with the 'sex ban' in England
But NYC knows its people. We're probably going to have sex anyway as things begin to open back up, especially after being cooped up for the past few months. So the document continues with some offbeat tips on staying safe:
""If two is company then three (or more) is definitely a crowd."" These guidelines don't judge, however, so they share what you should do if you find yourself at a bunker orgy. Tips include include fucking in a well-ventilated space and bringing hand sanitizer. Sexy!

Beyond group sex, there are more bullet points on safe pandemic sex:

Not only does NYC advise against kissing or having oral sex, they suggest wearing a face mask. ""Maybe it's your thing, maybe it's not,"" the guidelines read, ""but during COVID-19 wearing a face covering that covers your nose and mouth is a good way to add a layer of protection during sex.""
You may think masked sex sounds kinky, but wait until you get to the part of the document that outright recommends kinky sex:

""Not all of those Tweets had potentially misleading content associating COVID-19 and 5G,"" Twitter admitted.

SEE ALSO: Twitter updates misinformation rules again to fight 5G coronavirus truthers
So Twitter is promising to improve the automation process for labels and make sure fewer labels are posted on ""unrelated"" tweets. The thread didn't go into how it'll do that exactly, but, say, an article about telecom workers threatened by 5G-corona believers should no longer get flagged as misinformation. Only articles and tweets that perpetuate unsubstantiated claims should get caught in Twitter's system once it's updated.
By the way, even with the labeling roll-back, 5G still doesn't cause coronavirus."

In a blog post, VP and engineer Tim Bray, who worked at the company for five years, said he ""quit in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19."" He went on to describe the firing as ""chickenshit."" 
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment for this article.
If you haven't been following the drama, Amazon fired two workers who spoke out about the company's warehouse conditions during the coronavirus outbreak. 
The UX designers, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, took to Twitter last month to talk about the ""lack of safe and sanitary working conditions"" for warehouse workers. Very shortly after, the workers were fired for ""repeatedly violating internal policies.""
That same month, CNN reported that three warehouse workers were also fired for speaking out about their working conditions. 
Bray mentioned in his blog post that ""firing whistleblowers isn't just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink the poison."" 
""It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.""
And, while he said that company is now prioritizing warehouse safety, he stressed that he believed the workers who spoke out, saying that ""Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that's not just Amazon, it's how 21st-century capitalism is done.""
SEE ALSO: I canceled my Amazon Prime membership. You can, too.
He also emphasized the difference in how Amazon treats its warehouse workers and corporate employees. 
Bray described Amazon Web Services (where he worked) as an ""ethical organization"" that treats its workers humanely and pushes them to find work-life balance, among other perks such as higher pay.
Meanwhile, warehouse workers are ""treated like crap,"" partly because healthcare in the U.S. is tied to employment. 
According to Bray, legal guardrails achieved through ""antitrust and living-wage and worker empowerment legislation"" are necessary to end the exploitation of workers."

""We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000,"" he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ""To all of the families &amp; friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy &amp; love for everything that these great people stood for &amp; represent. God be with you!"""

He wasn't totally wrong but he hadn't solved the problem either.,"As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/06/politics/strategic-national-stockpile-coronavirus-trump-invs/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200506110754-01-strategic-national-stockpile-super-tease.jpg,2020-05-06T22:50:05Z,"(CNN)As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama.
It was Obama and other administrations, he said, who left the shelves of the nation's Strategic National Stockpile bare of the items needed to combat the coronavirus. 
To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration did use and then failed to replace items from the stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic. 
But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said.
The President's criticism also ignored a key point: The stockpile was never intended -- or funded -- to be a panacea for a pandemic. Rather, it serves as one piece of the overall supply chain puzzle during a disaster.
The stockpile's inadequacies quickly came to light in the coronavirus pandemic -- a devastating health crisis that experts have long predicted. Trump delayed striking deals with the private sector and invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to produce more medical supplies, making a bad situation worse. And states -- bidding against one another and other countries for supplies at sharp markups -- turned to the quick relief of the stockpile, only to find it understocked and the federal stewards overseeing it in disarray.
The picture was complicated even further when a whistleblower alleged this week that the system of deciding what to put in the stockpile had been corrupted by outside lobbyists and politically driven decision-making, rather than science. 
""People who somehow believed it was a bottomless pit filled with everything they can imagine were not paying attention,"" said Tara O'Toole, a physician and former Department of Homeland Security official who once chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile.
If politicians were surprised to discover that, ""then shame on them,"" she said.
Asked about why his administration hadn't replenished the bare cupboards he complained about, Trump suggested in an interview aired Tuesday that he was too busy dealing with scandalsthe President called them ""hoaxes""that have marred the first three years of his administration.
""Well, I'll be honest with you,"" Trump told ABC News Anchor David Muir. ""I (had) a lot of things going on.""
'The difference between life and death'
States quickly realized the stockpile wasn't going to be their savior.
The federal government assured Illinois hundreds of thousands of N95 respirator masks were on the way, Illinois Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell said. But when the trucks arrived, the masks turned out to be surgical masks -- insufficient protection for the health care workers treating patients with the devastating virus.
The difference in the masks is ""the difference between life and death,"" for frontline health care workers, Mitchell said. ""What we have gotten out of the Strategic National Stockpile has not been what we were promised or what we were owed.""
Similar complaints popped up across the country. Some states questioned whether supplies were being distributed equitably. Others reported receiving supplies that had passed their expiration date, had deteriorated or were not properly maintained. 
When California received 170 ventilators from the federal stockpile that were not in working condition, it enlisted Bloom Energy, which normally produces clean energy fuel cells, to help refurbish the machines.
""The only feedback we had was, 'These ventilators are not working,'"" Bloom's chief operations officer Susan Brennan said.
The ventilators had never been used but they also hadn't been prepped and preventative maintenance had not been performed, Brennan said. Bloom's team replaced batteries, calibrated oxygen settings, tested air flows and turned the rehabbed ventilators around in about 24 hours.
There were also maintenance issues with the remaining supplies in the stockpile. The government held 10,000 ventilators in reserve in anticipation of a surge in the coronavirus, Trump said in April. But about 20% of those ventilators were not in shape to be deployed because of a lapse in the government contract to keep the machines maintained, a source familiar with the matter said. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said, ""All ventilators deployed from the SNS are in operating condition and maintained based on the original manufacturer's specifications outlined in the service manual.""
The HHS inspector general announced last month it would conduct an audit of whether the stockpile was effectively managed during the coronavirus crisis.
""We've always reviewed aspects of the Department's planning and response to emergencies,"" a spokesperson for the inspector general said. ""In this case, however, the ongoing public health crisis prompted this review."" 
Greg Burel likened his job as director of the Strategic National Stockpile to managing a Home Depot for disasters. He kept track of some $8 billion worth of supplies and oversaw an annual budget in the hundreds of millions.
Despite his national security clearance ending with his retirement in January, a related non-disclosure agreement prevents him from saying much more about the secretive national stash he supervised for nearly 13-years. 
He won't say precisely how many facilities there are -- that's classified -- or what exactly is in them -- also classified.
""We keep it pretty much under wraps. The reason we do that is so a determined enemy can't figure out how to do something bad to us,"" Burel explained. ""If somebody knows what's in it, they can say, 'Well, if they can take care of the zombie apocalypse, but they can't take care of something else, well, we'll do the something else.'""
Still, bits and pieces of the stockpile's history can be gleaned from congressional testimony, government websites and obscure publications such as the Domestic Preparedness Journal, in which Burel wrote a three-part series on the SNS shortly before his retirement.
The stockpile was created in 1999 amid fears of a bioterrorism attack coinciding with the Y2K computer switch over. Dubbed the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile at the time, the idea was to establish and maintain a sufficient supply of medicine and medical equipment in strategic locations around the US to be able to quickly help state and local communities in the wake of an attack with agents such as anthrax, smallpox, plague or other pathogens.
That Y2K attack never came. But the stockpile was tapped following another disaster soon thereafter: On September 11, 2001, planes delivering stockpile supplies to New York City were the only flights allowed in American skies other than military aircraft and Air Force One.
In the wake of 9/11, the stockpile was given its current name: Strategic National Stockpile. It was used again in the early 2000s in response to a series of anthrax attacks around the US and ultimately supplied with enough medication to treat up to 12 million people.
In the years since the SNS has been used in response to a variety of disasters, from outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and botulism to flooding and 10 major hurricanes, including Katrina, Sandy and Maria.
The event most comparable to the Covid-19 crisis was in 2009, when the SNS was used to fortify the response to the H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic. In 2003, under the George W. Bush administration, Burel said it had begun stockpiling massive quantities of antiviral medication and supplies in anticipation of pandemic influenza. It marked the first departure from its original mission of preparing for a terrorist attack.
When H1N1 hit, the stockpile unleashed its largest deployment ever -- millions of drugs, masks and other protective gear for health workers across all 50 states.
Those supplies were never replenished, partly because Congress declined the Obama administration's repeated requests to increase funding.
Burel said the normally low-profile SNS has received more attention in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis than at any point in its history.
One problem with all that attention, he said, is that ""everybody then infers that it was supposed to be the place to get anything and everything you need for any kind of health care event. But the reality is it was never designed for that. And it was never funded for that.""
Enough supplies? 'Well, of course not' 
It wasn't a secret that the US didn't have adequate supplies on hand to fight a pandemic. Experts had been telling politicians as much for years. The warnings continued into the Trump administration before the pandemic, which transferred management of the SNS away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to another arm of HHS.
Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response who is now in charge of the stockpile, prioritized preparing for a bioterrorism attack over a naturally occurring pandemic, he said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.
Still, he warned a congressional panel in December that ""supply chain issues are among the most significant challenges to preparing for an influenza pandemic as well as other infectious diseases."" 
Kadlec testified America depended on overseas production for everything from gloves to pharmaceuticals.
""In a pandemic environment, this dependence could become a matter of national security, as we witnessed during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009,"" Kadlec said.
When HHS Secretary Alex Azar appeared before lawmakers in February seeking additional funding to combat the coronavirus, senators asked what was already available in the stockpile.
Azar told them there were masks and ventilators on hand.
Asked whether there were enough, he responded, ""Well, of course not. ...This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge globally, and will require additional measures."" 
'It's supposed to be our stockpile'
Disappointing returns from the stockpile and an overall erratic federal response had already shaken states' confidence in the administration.
When Kushner, the President's senior adviser and son-in-law, was charged with working on the supply chain, it initially inspired a sigh of relief, according to several government agency sources. 
The idea of a point person seemed a step in the right direction after officials with HHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent a month sorting out their respective roles in ramping production of personal protective equipment and tests needed for the Covid-19 response.
But enthusiasm quickly faded as it became clear that Kushner's involvement was adding more confusion to the already chaotic response, one source said.
Appearing in the briefing room in early April, Kushner claimed, ""The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile; it's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.""
Kushner's assessment flew in the face of the official definition of the stockpile from its website. 
The language was quickly changed a day after Kushner's statement to skew closer to his interpretation. 
Officials across the country were gobsmacked.
For Illinois, it was another sign they were on their own to replenish critical medical supplies. It left the state in a ""Lord of the Flies"" battle for supplies against other states and countries, Mitchell said.
""If I am successful in procuring a mask, an N95 mask for a health care worker in the state of Illinois, that very often may mean that there's a health care worker in Wisconsin or Michigan or Georgia or California who now does not have an N95 mask,"" Mitchell said. ""We have been pitted against each other in a way that's literally going to cost us lives that could have been saved and that is on the White House.""
Mitchell said he's also concerned states could be left on their own -- fighting in an international bidding war -- to acquire a life-saving vaccine, once one becomes available.
""Based on what we've seen, it's not a crazy scenario,"" he said.
The HHS spokesperson said the stockpile is not responsible for distributing the vaccine but the ""SNS is working now with federal and commercial supply chain partners to ensure ancillary supplies such as needles and syringes are produced and available in adequate quantities for a nationwide vaccination campaign once a vaccine is made available.""
""When I took this over, it was an empty box,"" the President said in a March briefing. ""And I'm not just blaming President Obama. You go long before that.""
During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the stockpile distributed 12.5 million antiviral regiments, 19.6 million pieces of PPE and 85.1 million N95 masks, according to a 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 
The Obama administration didn't replace those supplies, nor did the Trump administration take the initiative to do so until it found itself in the midst of a global pandemic.
The US needed 3.5 billion N95 respirator masks for a ""severe event,"" HHS' Kadlec told the Senate in March. There were only 12 million in the stockpile, Azar said in February, along with another 5 million N95s he believed were past their expiration date.
It took weeks of politicians and health care workers openly begging for supplies before Trump flipped the switch on the DPA and launched public-private partnerships aimed at easing the shortages.
Months before the administration ramped up production, at least one major mask-maker was reaching out to the federal government warning that shortages were imminent. But Kadlec and others ignored the mask-maker's repeated offers to ramp up production, according to the whistleblower complaint filed by Dr. Rick Bright, a top HHS official and one of Kadlec's deputies.
When the administration finally struck production deals, it would take even longer for American manufacturers, who have shifted so much production overseas, to build out production capacity in the US.
When Moldex-Metric, the second-largest disposable respiratory mask-maker in the US, secured a major mask-making contract with HHS, it also began pursuing ways to add equipment and production lines.
""There's only so much capacity to make these in the United States. Most of the manufacturers here have their plants, and we can run them 24/7 and hit capacity,"" James Hornstein, general counsel for Moldex-Metric, said last month. After H1N1, ""no one came to us and said we want you to ramp up your automated manufacturing lines, so you can make more when you turn on the switch."" 
The failure to keep American cupboards stocked with crucial medical supplies stretches back across administration and across party lines.
Public health and national security experts say politicians have consistently failed to treat public health issues, such as emerging infectious diseases, and the fragile supply chain surrounding them as a serious national security threat.
Pointing fingers over the stockpile ""is the politicians diverting from the fact that they were basically negligent,"" O'Toole said. 
Lucrative contracts based on political connections'
In the whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday, Bright said the stockpile's mission had been compromised by politics well before it began making headlines in connection with the coronavirus.
Bright was involved in procuring medicines and other material for the SNS and said he was pressured ""to award lucrative contracts based on political connections and cronyism.""
Bright, who was reassigned from his role as the director of the Biomedical and Advanced Research Development Authority, said that pressure included an ""outsized role"" played by a pharmaceutical industry consultant who represented a company whose CEO purportedly had ties to Kushner.
Bright's complaint details Kadlec's alleged efforts to steer contracts to companies represented by the industry consultant with whom he had ""a long standing connection."" 
In one case, Kadlec directed $40 million to SNS to fund a drug that expert advisers deemed ""inferior"" to alternatives, according to the complaint. In another case that was the subject of an inspector generation investigation, a $55 million contract was awarded -- over the objection of expert advisers -- to a company the consultant represented, Bright's complaint alleges.
Bright's allegations mirror concerns raised by Tom Frieden, who served as director of the CDC under Obama.
In interview with CNN last month, Frieden lamented what he called the ""misguided, politicized and corrupt"" transfer of the SNS away from the CDC to Kadlec's office in late 2018.
Other experts on the stockpile supported the change, but Frieden said the change ushered in a new standard for how the SNS did business.
""The basis for decisions used to be how to save the most lives"" he said. ""Now, it's how to satisfy the most lobbyists.""
Kadlec could not be reached for comment about Bright's complaint. A statement released by HHS after it was filed on Tuesday did not offer a detailed response to the document.
A stockpile '10 times' bigger
There are signs the administration is already rethinking how to prepare the stockpile for the next disaster. Congress allocated $16 billion in one of the coronavirus relief packages to bolster the stockpile with supplies like masks, respirators and pharmaceuticals. 
Trump has vowed: ""We're building up our stockpile again like crazy."" And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the US needs ""bigger and better insurance policies.""
""So we are going to look at stockpiles that are probably 10 times as big,"" Navarro said last week on a visit to a General Motors plant making ventilators. 
Despite the assurances, a FEMA spokesperson said, ""As of right now, there is no effort being made to replenish the stockpile. Inventory that is available is being used to fill urgent needs of the states to help mitigate PPE burn rates.""
Experts are skeptical that a stockpile of any size can adequately prepare the US unless there are other changes, including more domestic manufacturing of medical supplies and a commitment from hospitals to keep more protective equipment on hand.
""We cannot stockpile our way out of these situations no matter how big the stockpile,"" O'Toole said. ""We took our eye off the ball in allowing our entire supply chain to move to other countries."" 
Navarro said the administration was also ""going to think differently about how the stockpiles actually exist,"" which might include ensuring American manufacturers have reserve capacity they can quickly bring online in a crisis. 
As for Burel, he's watching the crisis unfold from his new perch as the president of a consulting firm. He left his post as stockpile director on January 3, 2020, a retirement date he says he had planned since shortly after he began working for the government as an intern.
Had he known further in advance that Covid-19 was coming, he said, ""I would have delayed everything.""
From the sidelines, he said he hopes that this crisis leads to a permanent increase in its funding rather than a one-time infusion. 
""If the country wants the SNS to be the savior for these kinds of things,"" Burel told CNN, ""it's gonna have to tell Congress to fund it."" 
The price tag for that, he said, would be in the billions annually.

""This pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing. A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge,"" the 44th President said during a virtual commencement address for historically black colleges and universities. 
""If the world is going to get better, it's going to be up to you,"" he added.
CNN previously reported that Obama had criticized the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus crisis as ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private phone call with former staffers and administration alums. Obama did not reference President Donald Trump by name on Saturday.
During his message to the HBCU graduates, Obama also spoke of how the pandemic has disproportionately affected black communities. 
""A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country. We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities,"" he said during the ""Show Me Your Walk"" virtual commencement program.
""Just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning. Injustice like this isn't new,"" Obama said, referring to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a young black man in Georgia.
Obama, who was a former civil rights lawyer and community organizer before he ran for political office, also gave three pieces of advice for the graduating class to ""create change.""
""No generation has been better positioned to be warriors for justice and remake the world,"" Obama said.
He encouraged the HBCU graduates to organize at the grassroots level (and not just resort to online activism), to grow allies in the fight for a common cause, and remember ""you're all role models now, whether you like it or not.""

Infants may be at a higher risk for severe forms of the disease, compared to older children, according to the CDC. But the data is still pretty limited, and what scientists know about these infections is based on a handful of case reports.
The CDC said babies are most likely exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets from their mom or from other caregivers or visitors. There are some limited reports that they may be exposed to the virus right before or even during labor, but the science on that is still unclear, the federal agency said.
Since there is still limited information about how frequently these cases occur, doctors should presume such newborns have an infection. These newborns should be isolated from other healthy newborns and they should temporarily be kept separate from their mothers to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. If the mother's test results are negative, the CDC says the temporary separation can end.
It's unclear when the optimal time to test is, but the CDC suggests they first be tested 24 hours after they are born and if the test is negative, doctors should test them again the next day. In parts of the country where available testing is limited, the CDC recommends these newborns should be prioritized. Newborns don't need a negative test to be discharged from the hospital.
If infants do become infected, some of the Covid-19 symptoms are similar to what doctors have seen with adult patients -- fever, cough, breathing problems and stomach issues like diarrhea and vomiting. Infants may also appear lethargic. The CDC says the extent to which a Covid-19 infection contributed to these symptoms is still unclear, though, since these same symptoms can also be seen commonly in infants for other reasons.
Much like with older children, the majority of infants who have tested positive for Covid-19 tend to be asymptomatic, or they have a mild form of the disease and recover without complication, according to the CDC. There have, however, been some cases where the infant had to be put on a ventilator.
If there isn't room to separate a mother with an infection from the child, the CDC suggests the mother use a face mask and practice good hand hygiene. The CDC does not recommend masks for any child under the age of 2. 
Healthcare providers should use protective clothing and masks when handling the infants."

In April, the Black Hawk CountyHealth Department linked the Waterloo Tyson plant to 182 of the county's 374 Covid-19 cases before Tyson temporarily shut the place down and tested its 2,800 staff members for the deadly virus.
The plant reopened on May 7. The Tyson employee who died Monday was diagnosed with coronavirus in April, according to a friend and a family member. 
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of any Tyson team member and are keeping the family in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time,"" a Tyson spokesperson told CNN Business via email Tuesday.
The Tyson employee who died has been identified as Jose Ayala, 44, according to his bother, Art Hernandez, and Zach Medhaug, who says he was Ayala's friend and co-worker at the Tyson plant.
Medhaug, who told CNN Business he too was diagnosed with Covid-19 in late April, has been chronicling the Tyson Waterloo plant's Covid-19 outbreak on Facebook and providing updates on Ayala's condition since March.
""I was with him in his final moments,"" Medhaug said of Ayala on Tuesday. ""You don't think you're going to go to work and see your friend and less than a week later, he's going to be on a ventilator and a couple months later, you're going to be holding his hands in his last minutes.""
Hernandez said his brother was a ""homebody"" and an avid gamer who loved ""Diablo"" and ""Call of Duty.""
""He was very down-to-earth,"" Hernandez said. ""He would help out a lot of people and never expected anything in return.""
Medhaug said he and Ayala became friends shortly after Ayala moved to Waterloo from Laredo, Texas, six years ago to work at the Tyson plant, where Medhaug has also worked for the past 11 years. His loved ones said Ayala had three siblings and a large extended family. 
""Jose is a good man,"" Medhaug wrote in a Facebook post. ""He is an amazing friend. He could always make everyone in the room smile. He would do anything for anyone.""
Medhaug said he himself suffered from minor symptoms before a doctor diagnosed him with Covid-19 on April 20, but Ayala had suffered from labored breathing, fever, exhaustion and a cough since late March. 
Ayala wasn't tested until after he was put on a medical ventilator on April 12, according to Medhaug and Hernandez.
""At that point he had moved to a high-risk status,"" Medhaug said of Ayala. ""Since they needed to move him on a ventilator, they needed to know what they were treating him for, so he was tested.""
Medhaug said he is convinced he and his friend caught the virus at work. ""There's no where else we could have got sick from,"" he said.
Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation that Medhaug and Ayala were infected on the job. 
In an earlier email, the company said the health and safety of its team members is its top priority.
""We take this responsibility very seriously, and we have put in place a host of protective steps at our facilities that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing COVID-19,"" the company said."

It took less than two months for the pandemic to put the family-run shop in Washington, DC, out of business. 
At first, owner Dianna Finisecy, who goes by Dee Dee, felt she should stay open, but reduce hours to limit her and her workers' exposure to customers. The shop, which shared a building with a hospital, was frequented by doctors and nurses, but business still slowed and she wasn't bringing in enough to make rent. Finisecy closed for good at the end of April, bringing some frames home with her and calling up 1-800-Junk to pick up the rest. ""It's an awful way to go,"" she said.
It wasn't until May, more than a week after Finisecy shut her doors for the last time, that she was finally approved for a forgivable relief loan from the government's Paycheck Protection Program. She used it to pay off her March and April rent as well her employees' full salaries, like she was supposed to -- and now, with the shop gone, she's worried she might wind up having to pay it back. 
""I'd hate to go out after 50 years and have that monkey on my back,"" Finisecy said. 
Slow to reach the people who needed it most
That wasn't how things were supposed to go for small business owners in the pandemic. Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in March as part of its sweeping $2.2 trillion economic stimulus response to get money quickly into the hands of small business owners. It's doled out more than 4 million loans worth $512 billion over the past seven weeks and has saved 50 million jobs, according to the Treasury Department. 
But it was slow to reach small companieslike Wagner Opticians as big businesses, like Shake Shack and the LA Lakers, got money first. Plus, there are restrictions on how the money can be spent that are making it hard for some business owners to even use the money while they remain shut down. 
The loans are forgivable if 75% of the money is used on payroll within an eight week period -- a controversial time frame that both Republicans and Democrats have expressed support to change. It may have been reasonable in March when it was hard to imagine cities and states would have stay-at-home orders in place for so long.
Despite the bipartisan support, the Senate adjourned for a week-long recess Thursday without voting on extending the eight-week window. Meanwhile, some businesses that were among the first to get the money are entering their eighth week carrying loans and are unsure if they should risk spending the money without knowing if it will be forgiven later.
It's becoming clear that the loans won't be enough to save many small businesses as the pandemic continues for longer than most people, including the lawmakers who drew up the bill, expected.
More than 6% of small business owners surveyed by the Census Bureau said that they don't ever expect to return to normal operations and about 7% said they don't have enough cash on hand to last more than a week. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned this week that the central bank and Congress may have to do more to prevent some jobs from going away forever.
""If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there will be longer term damage to the economy,"" Powell said in an interview with CBS. 
""The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now,"" he added. 
Restaurant owners don't know if customers will return
Restaurants have been particularly hard hit. During the last week in March, the National Restaurant Association said 3% had already permanently closed. 
Cathy Rasco will reopen her shop, Arabica Coffee, in Portland, Maine, on June 1. But she's already decided that her second location, less than a mile away, is staying closed for good.
That location, near ferry and cruise ship terminals, was always slower in the winter. She couldn't imagine making it without a strong tourist season too. Rasco, who's been in business since 1995, moved everything out of what had been that larger of her two spaces, and is still looking for a home for her coffee roaster. 
She doesn't know if customers will come back once she reopens and is afraid to spend any of the loan money she received from the Paycheck Protection Program with so many unknowns and a lack of clarity around the rules. She plans to start by bringing back just a handful of the 26 staff she had when closures took effect. 
""I feel like I'm just gambling, and it's not the time to do that,"" Rasco said, noting that selling a low-price-point product like coffee means she needs hundreds of customers to be profitable. 
She's installing plexiglass along the bar to protect her workers and plans to allow customers in just one door and out another, encouraging one-way foot traffic. 
""I'm very aware this could be the end of Arabica, and if that's how it is, at least I know I'm giving it my best shot,"" she said. 
The loan program is a 'total failure'
Portland's LB Kitchen, named for its co-owners Lee Farrington and Bryna Gootkind, has been filling to-go orders for smoothies, salads, and sandwiches since late March. Gootkind says she doesn't know if they'll fully reopen until there's a vaccine.
On Wednesday, they announced that their second location would be closing permanently. ""LB West,"" as they called it, shared a space with a nonprofit organization and it seemed that it would be too hard to control people coming in-and-out while adhering to safety guidelines. 
They also received a loan from the Paycheck Protection Program, but at this point, don't intend on spending any of the money. 
Like many business owners, Gootkind said it didn't make any sense to bring all of her 24 workers back on payroll when her shop is still not fully open. Some workers find that, with a separate congressionally-approved $600-a-week boost to benefits, they're earning more on unemployment than they would by coming back to work -- especially if hours are reduced.
But that means LB Kitchen's loan might not be forgiven. So instead, they plan on giving it all back.
""Honestly, it's not even worth trying to figure out. It's like trying to crack a code,"" Gootkind said. ""I feel like it's a total failure."""

5,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Francesca Street, CNN",Can this super-simple device stop virus spreading on airplanes?,"It's not flashy or futuristic-looking, but it's simple, cheap and apparently effective: British aircraft interior company RAS Completions says its new personal protection shield could help protect fliers from Covid-19.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/airplane-shield-seat-solution/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200611104739-iso-view-seat-super-tease.jpg,2020-06-11T09:58:46Z,"(CNN) It's not flashy or futuristic-looking, but it's simple, cheap and apparently effective: British aircraft interior company RAS Completions says its new personal protection shield could help protect fliers from Covid-19.
The shield, says RAS Completions, is designed to be installed between seats and doesn't involve taking the middle seat out of action.
The Personal Protection Window is currently seeking approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the company says it'll be ready for airline customers within the next couple weeks.
The shields are designed to protect passengers from the risk of droplet transmission and are made from transparent polycarbonate.
The idea, RAS Completions Business Development Manager Roger Patron tells CNN Travel, is to produce a ""single product that fits every type of commercial aircraft.""
It's mainly designed to aid economy seating, Patron says, as that's where passengers tend to be closest together, but it could also be used in different classes of cabin.
RAS Completions adds that the shields are non-obstructive, so wouldn't prevent emergency evacuation or seat recline.
""Simplicity is the best,"" says Patron. ""We tried to make them the simplest, effective way of keeping people safe.""
""Our product is very simple to make, it will be cheap, it will do the job -- it's not about the look, although we obviously understand that we want people to feel safe within the cabin.""
The cost aspect is crucial, says Patron, airlines have suffered financial losses in the wake of the pandemic, and will be keen to come up with solutions to getting passengers back in the sky that don't break the bank.
This hasn't stopped some aviation companies suggesting solutions that involve eradicating the middle seat -- including Interspace Lite, from transportation technology company Universal Movement, which envisages a temporarily-blocked-off middle seat and reimagines that seat as a divider.
Universal Movement has partnered with airplane seat manufacturer Safran and aims to bring Interspace to market by late summer.
Meanwhile, Italian company Aviointeriors has suggested a idea of a row of three economy seats with the middle seat facing the opposite way, while French engineer Florian Barjot's concept, PlanBay, also includes a removable piece of kit that could be placed on the middle seat.
The RAS Completions' Personal Protection Window doesn't really offer complete social distancing.
Patron says he's aware that getting travelers comfortable with flying again could be a challenge. 
""I think if you had the alternative which was nothing in between you and somebody you didn't know sitting a few inches away from you, I think I, for sure, would feel more secure if I had a little non-intrusive screen which gave me comfort that the airline first of all cared -- and also gave me the opportunity to distance myself from somebody in very close proximity,"" says Patron.
Because the shields are easy to install and uninstall, Patron says it's also a solution that's adaptable for an ever-changing situation. Ideally, it'll be used alongside face masks and hand sanitizer.
Patron says RAS Completions has been in contact with airlines and some are showing interest, others are remaining cautious and seeing how the market develops.
""We see this as a medium, not long term solution,"" he says.
""It has gone through some very rigorous testing, so if the airline needs it for six months or a year then it's built for that."""

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott warned that ""tougher actions"" may be imposed if the numbers there continue to spike, but he stressed that closing down the state again ""will always be the last option."" 
""Covid-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas, and it must be corralled,"" Abbott said Monday. Houstons Health Department said Harris County hospitals have a 177% increase in Covid-19 positive patients since May 31. 
The number of coronavirus cases in Florida reached a milestone on Monday, as the state reported 100,217 cases, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health. 
The Sunshine State has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,"" and risks being the ""worst it has ever been,"" according to projections from a model by scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
Arizona, where President Trump plans to travel today, continues to see its new case numbers climb. The state averaged about 2,412 new reported cases per day over the week ending June 21, up about 94% from the previous 7-day period, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.
Officials say the major thrust of new coronavirus cases in the US is in the South and West has also been attributed to more young people ignoring social distancing measures and testing positive.
Young people are more likely to have milder outcomes from coronavirus, but they can still infect others who are more at risk.
""With younger age of recent infections in at least some places such as Florida, expect a lower death rate in this wave ... until the 20-40 year olds who are infected today go on to infect others,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Twitter.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told Axios that the recent high number of cases in young people is ""not surprising."" Like Frieden, he warned of what's to come.
""They get infected first, then they come home, and then they infect the older people. The older people get the complications, and then they go to the hospitals,"" Fauci said. ""The death rate always lags several weeks behind the infection rate."""

Texas, Virginia and Vermont each said they recognized the data issue and moved to fix it in the past few days. 
Diagnostic PCR tests, which use saliva or sputum, check for current infection, while antibody tests, which rely on blood, check for past infection. Combining the two into one result could provide an inaccurate picture of where and when the virus spread and mislead policy-makers and the public.
""Public health officials need to know how many people in my state or my community currently have Covid-19. They also need to learn how many people had it in the past and potentially are immune to it,"" said CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""Those are two completely different things.""
Combining the two types of tests could also overstate a state's ability to test and track active infections.
""You only know how many cases you have if you do a lot of testing,"" Cohen said. ""If you put the two tests together, you fool yourself into thinking you've done more testing than you have.""
Virginia and Vermont health officials said they fixed the data issue in the past week. Chris Van Duysen, spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email Monday that the state ""will be separating the numbers out this week"" and is ""working to integrate that into our online reporting.""
The issue is just one of the ways that coronavirus testing data can mislead or obscure when not used consistently and appropriately. 
For example, some countries and research institutions, including Johns Hopkins University and its widely cited coronavirus dashboard, have relied on data from a mysterious data aggregation site called Worldometer. And in the US in recent days, Georgia and Florida have faced questions about the transparency of their coronavirus data reporting.
Issues in Texas, Virginia and Vermont
The issue in Texas came after the Texas Observer reported the two testing results were being combined. Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday the state is not presently combining the numbers but did not acknowledge that it had been in the past.
""The answer is no. They are not comingling those numbers,"" Abbott said. ""Those numbers will be provided separately.""
Texas State Rep. Chris Turner, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, found Abbott's statement puzzling and reached out to the health department after Monday's press conference.
""They confirmed to my staff that in fact the testing total does include the antibody test. They said they would be breaking those out later in the week,"" Turner said. ""But for now the total number of tests reported includes both types of test.""
Turner argued that combining the numbers ""really muddies the data"" and ""indicates that our testing total is inflated.""
The Department of State Health Services did not provide CNN more specifics Tuesday on what percentage of the total tests being reported are antibody tests.
As of Wednesday morning, the department's website said the state had a total of 744,937 tests, 23,601 of those are from public labs, while 721,336 are from private labs. The state is reporting a total of 49,912 positive cases. The state's coronavirus dashboard did not yet reflect a distinction in antibody tests versus active virus tests. 
Abbott has been touting the low positivity rate in the state. It's unclear how many of those positive cases are from antibody tests or active infection tests.
Virginia similarly had been combining its antibody and diagnostic tests in its reported testing data, the Virginia Department of Health said last week. The department said separating out the results made ""minimal change in the percent positive of tests and no difference in overall trends.""
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, said he directed the Department of Health to separate out the testing results last week.
""I am a doctor, and I have said all along that I will act based on science and dataand the data must be reliable and up-to-date, so we can make informed decisions based on the facts,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Going forward, the (Virginia Department of Health) website will break out the number of diagnostic tests.""
Vermont, too, began separating its antibody test results from its diagnostic test results on May 16, according to the Department of Health.
""As we began seeing an increase in serology tests, we realized this is impacting the number and needed to correct it,"" said Ben Truman, spokesman for Vermont's Department of Health.

The decision to restart the CDC briefings comes as the death toll has reached a grim milestone of more than 103,000 and the White House has been under fire as of late for sidelining the Trump administration's health experts on its own coronavirus task force.
The CDC held a briefing Friday in which director Robert Redfield defended the agency's surveillance for the coronavirus and denied that it missed the spread of the virus across the country.
That session was the first of the resumption of the CDC's regular press briefings, a senior Health and Human Services official told CNN. 
The last of the regular briefings was March 9, shortly after a top CDC official warned that coronavirus would rapidly spread in the US, while the White House was downplaying the seriousness of it.
When the CDC conducted its regular briefings -- at times daily and then several times a week -- it included extensive question-and-answer sessions between reporters and the agency's medical experts.
The comments from Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, sent the stock market tumbling and in turn angered President Donald Trump.
Sources had told CNN that the trust issues between the CDC and White House trace back to the CDC's botched effort to distribute testing in early February, when contamination in the lab led to long delays. The relationship further soured after Messonnier's comments at the March 9 CDC briefing.
Significant tension between the White House and CDC has increasingly built over guidelines on how to reopen the country and how the government tracks data on the virus.
In interviews with CNN, CDC officials said they've been ""muzzled"" and that their agency's efforts to mount a coordinated response to the Covid-19 pandemic were hamstrung by a White House whose decisions are driven by politics rather than science.
Earlier this month, CNN reported the Trump administration shelved CDC-drafted guidelines to reopen the US, which were strict and more detailed than the White House's own road map toward a return to normal.
Trump has aggressively pushed for states to reopen even when they don't necessarily meet the parameters set out by his task force, whose meetings have been sharply curtailed.
The doctors on the task force, including Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, have appeared in public less and less as the country begins to reopen, despite fears of a potential resurgence.
During an interview with STAT in April, when it was pointed out that the CDC hadn't held a briefing in a month, Redfield was asked if he feared the CDC was being sidelined at a crucial moment.
""No, I wouldn't say that at all. I think we're fully engaged in all of the decisions,"" he told the health news site, adding, ""We're at the task force meeting every single day. We're giving our public health guidance and our recommendations.""

The states are among 18 across the nation seeing increasing trends in new cases from one week to the next. More than 2 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus and 116,962 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Health experts are warning that more infections and deaths are in store as states continue their reopening plans. 
Florida recorded almost 2,800 new coronavirus cases on Monday -- the highest number of new and confirmed cases in a single day the state has seen, according to the Florida Department of Health. Despite the increase, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Tuesday that the state will not shut down. 
""We're going to go forward. We're going to continue to protect the most vulnerable,"" DeSantis said. ""We're going to urge, continue to advise, particularly our elderly population to maintain social distancing, avoid crowds.""
Arizona reached a record-high daily number of cases on Tuesday, as did Texas.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott attributed the increase to an outbreak at an assisted living facility and delayed reporting.
But the state's hospitalization rate, a number officials monitor to ensure the healthcare system isn't overwhelmed, has been increasing as well.
Nationwide reopenings coupled with the flouting of personal safety measures has led researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington to increase their projections of Covid-19 deaths this summer.
""Unless we are effective at other things like wearing a mask, avoiding contact, it's going to pretty inexorably lead to the second wave,"" IHME Dr. Chris Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper. 
 18 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: West Virginia, California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Hawaii.
 10 states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Washington, Utah, South Dakota, Mississippi, Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Alaska, Maine and Delaware.
 22 states are seeing a downward trend: Iowa, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
 One state, Michigan, has seen a decrease of at least 50%.
The second wave may be coming, but we aren't out of the first yet
Early on, it looked as though the finish line for the pandemic was the end of summer. And even though experts no longer see that as the case, many Americans are eager to return to a sense of normalcy.
""We may be done with the pandemic, but the pandemic is not done with us,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said Tuesday. 
Murray expects a ""second wave"" to be begin late August, with the US reaching more than 201,000 coronavirus deaths by October 1. 
But rates of coronavirus cases in the US haven't yet dropped to a level low enough to call the first wave over.
As the virus spreads, it appears to be following highways, researchers from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania said Tuesday.
People are leaving their homes now that more places are opening. As more people interact with others, the disease spreads, the researchers found.
Texas mayors want mandatory masks to mitigate the spread
Nine Texas mayors, including the top officials in Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, have urged the state's governor to require face masks to stop the virus from spreading in their cities.
""If mayors are given the opportunity to require face coverings, we believe our cities will be ready to help reduce the spread of this disease,"" the mayors said in a letter to Abbott. 
New research supports the case for wearing masks to reduce spread.
In a study reported Tuesday, researchers estimated between 230,000 and 450,000 cases of the virus were prevented in the states that enacted requirements for mask use between April 8 and May 15.
""The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public might help in mitigating COVID-19 spread,"" wrote Wei Lyu and George Wehby, with the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa's College of Public Health.
Also in hopes of mitigating spread, the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives headed by former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden released a new contact tracing playbook Tuesday.
The guide will supplement CDC efforts to give local public health departments detailed guidance on how they can keep the virus from spreading further.

He is also the president-elect of the Coalition for Health Funding, and serves on the board of directors of ScienceCounts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)The public health threat of the Covid-19 pandemic has made the American public acutely aware of the impactful work done by researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health.
Federally funded researchers from coast to coast and beyond are working feverishly to understand SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. These scientists are racing to understand its makeup, its mechanism of entry into the human body, its characteristics outside the body and what existing therapies may help patients while a vaccine is being developed.
Why, then, did the NIH last week, as first reported by Politico, terminate a grant that supports leading research into how coronaviruses can be transferred from their natural host of bats to humans? 
The answer, it seems to me, is because Pete Daszak, the scientist who leads EcoHealth Alliance, the nonprofit biomedical research organization sponsoring the project, has collaborated with Shi Zhengli, a Chinese virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. 
In confirming to CNN that the grant funding was terminated the NIH said it ""does not discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards,"" but made a point to list sub-awardees, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This leaves room for speculation, as the Politico piece suggests, that it may have been at the behest of -- or at least with a strong implied nudge -- from the Trump administration. 
The agency's budget is established by Congress and the institutes make their own funding decisions, as they are best positioned to understand costs and needs of the projects. But the decision to yank Daszak's funding follows a growing effort by some to place blame on China for this pandemic.
And earlier this month, President Donald Trump said that there may be funding cuts in the research after a reporter suggested that grant money had been given to the Wuhan lab. (According to Politico, Daszak has maintained that ""no fund from [the grant] have been sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor has any contract been signed."") 
Now that the President has seemingly made good on that promise, many scientists are deeply concerned. Meanwhile, NIH-funded researchers have been working hard to investigate the virus killing more Americans than the Vietnam War. 
Zhengli and Daszak, who I know of by reputation due to their impressive work, are virus hunters -- skilled experts seeking out coronaviruses and other diseases that could be transferable from bat populations to humans, the same disease vector scientists believe to be the genesis of the current outbreak. 
Combined, the researchers have collected thousands of samples and identified hundreds of new coronaviruses with the goal of preventing future pandemics. 
Daszak's credentials are impressive. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and in the past has advised the director of medical preparedness policy on the White House national security team.
His first five-year NIH grant on this topic began in 2014, after the usual competitive research funding process scientists across the country must navigate. Preliminary data are collected, hypotheses are generated, and proposals are written to share the research goals, methods, anticipated results.
These grants are then reviewed not by government bureaucrats but by fellow scientists, and often competitors, who are selected to serve on grant review panels because they are experts in the field. These review panelists understand the science in question and can evaluate the scientific merit behind the proposal. 
So rigorous is the process that last fiscal year, according to the NIH, more than 67,000 grant applications were received and only 22% were approved for funding. In FY2014, when Daszak was first funded, the success rate was only 20%. In 2019, Daszak submitted a proposal to extend his grant another five years, and the panelists found the research so promising that the NIH funded the grant to 2024. 
Included among the 20 scientific papers published from Daszak's initial grant is the discovery of how SARS coronaviruses enter cells -- a critical piece of information necessary for those working to develop Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines.
According to Politico, in a letter to EcoHealth Alliance officials last Friday, Michael Lauer, the NIH deputy director for extramural research, stated that Daszak's research does not ""align with the program goals and agency priorities."" There has been no reported explanation from the NIH as to why the research no longer aligns with NIH priorities.
More than a million Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, and over 61,000 have died.
Yet, regardless of whether the Trump administration is responsible for the funding cuts, the President has expressed views that a well-respected scientist and expert on coronavirus research is no longer worthy of investment. How can that be possible?
It seems that Trump's desire to keep the spotlight on China's role in the pandemic has overridden scientific independence. And this mentality seems to be spreading. Last weekend, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas suggested Chinese students should come to America to study Shakespeare but not science, arguing that they ""go back to China... and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people.""
Has this growing jingoism influenced the decision to revoke Daszak's research grant? 
Politicizing peer-reviewed science is a dangerous threat to the independent American scientific enterprise and is the first step on a deeply concerning slippery slope.
If Daszak's research can be stopped by funding cuts at the whim of the President, what other research grants in the future will be pulled because of the left or right leanings of any future president? What damage would such a decision have on the world-leading productivity and reputation of the National Institutes of Health? 
Science must remain independent and nonpoliticized if it is to be trusted and productive during this pandemic crisis and beyond."

Most schools in the United States are closed for the rest of the academic year and plans for the fall are in flux, with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention making recommendations that include reduced hours, social distancing and extended dismissals.
In other countries, some schools are reopening classrooms. Here is how some of those schools look, which could provide clues for how we think our children will, one day, resume their education.
In South Korea, students won't all return at once. Third-year high school students will start back next week so they can make career and college decisions, Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said.
Middle schools, elementary schools and kindergartens will be open by June 1, Yoo said.
Most of Vietnam's 22 million students returned to class Monday, after a monthslong closure, according to state media Vietnam News Agency (VNA). 
But online and televised classes will continue with new schedules and reduced in-person teaching, the report said.
In Austria, students will split into two cohorts to attend school every other day to allow for distancing, Education Minister Heinz Fassmann said, according to reports.
Israel is beginning a phased return over the next few weeks and setting a maximum limit of 17 students in each classroom.
The Ministry of Education told CNN that attendance was about 60% in the schools that did open earlier this week, possibly a sign that parents were nervous about sending their children back. 
Denmark, which was one of the first nations in Europe to close shops, restaurants and schools, has welcomed children back to class.
Desks are placed so students sit at least 2 meters or 6 feet apart.
Schools in Denmark are also having children eat lunch in their classrooms to avoid students gathering in larger groups. 
In Australia, the government has asked older or more vulnerable members of the school community to work from home if possible.
Germany is requiring social distancing for students in and out of classrooms, with some schools taping distance and direction markers on floors to keep people safely apart.
An elementary school in Hangzhou, China, helped children to keep their distance by making hats for them to wear in the classroom, the People's Daily reported.
Wherever children and teachers have been welcomed back to school, masks seem to be a near constant.

(CNN) Although most governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel, a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.
Earlier this month, the European Union unveiled an action plan to reopen its internal borders in time for summer, while countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed ""travel bubbles,"" lifting restrictions for each other's citizens.
A number of Caribbean islands are preparing to open their doors to foreign visitors in June, while destinations such as Mexico and Thailand are planning to open up again region by region in the coming weeks.
If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now. 
Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.
According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.
The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26.
Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room ""quarantine hotel"" will be available to patients' family and ""close contacts.""
""The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,"" states the letter.
The news came shortly after Cyprus Transport Minister Yiannis Karousos announced hotels in the country will reopen on June 1, while international air travel will restart on June 9.
Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter.
Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first.
From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic. 
However, the list is to be expanded to include further countries in the coming months.
Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip.
The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart.
Bali has also been successful in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with less than 350 confirmed cases and, at the time of writing, a total of four deaths. 
The Indonesian island now hopes to welcome tourists back by October, provided its infection rates stay low.
Bali's economy is hugely dependent on tourism and visitor numbers have been rising in recent years, with around 6.3 million people visiting in 2019.
""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy ... it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mangku Nyoman Kandia, a Bali tour guide, told ABC News in April. ""No tourist, no money.""
All foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, are currently banned from Indonesia, and anyone entering the island must undergo a swab test and provide a letter stating they are free of Covid-19.
It's unclear what the entry requirements will be if restrictions are lifted later this year, or whether Bali will accept travelers from regions badly affected by the pandemic.
Thailand has long been among the top destinations for travelers, receiving close to 40 million foreign tourists last year.
However, visitors have been banned from entering the Southeast Asian country since March because of the pandemic.
While the number of cases here has been relatively low in comparison to other destinations -- Thailand has reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases and over 50 deaths -- officials aren't taking any chances when it comes to reopening the country.
""It is still dependent on the outbreak situation, but I think the earliest we may see the return of tourists could be the fourth quarter of this year,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told CNN Travel.
The governor went on to stress there will be limitations on who can visit the country and what regions they can go to once restrictions are relaxed.
""We are not going to open all at once,"" he added. ""We are still on high alert, we just can't let our guards down yet. 
""We have to look at the country of origin [of the travelers] to see if their situation has truly improved."" 
This effectively means Thailand is unlikely to open its borders to travelers from destinations that don't appear to have the coronavirus situation under control.
Those that are given permission to enter may be offered ""long-stay packages"" in isolated areas ""where health monitoring can be easily controlled,"" such as the remote islands of Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Samui.
However, Thailand's borders are firmly shut for the time being. 
The ban on incoming international commercial flights -- excluding repatriation flights -- was recently extended until June 30 and Phuket International Airport remains closed.
Like many other global destinations, Thailand is currently focusing on domestic tourism.
In fact, some resorts and hotels have already been given the go ahead to reopen -- Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Bangkok, being one of them.
Shopping malls, museums, markets and some tourist attractions have also been reopening their doors, with Bangkok's Grand Palace due to reopen on June 4.
France was the most visited country in the world before the coronavirus pandemic.
Now, like the rest of the EU, restrictions are currently in place on all nonessential travel from outside the Schengen Zone (a grouping of 26 countries which normally have open borders). 
Travelers who do enter the country, with the exception of EU citizens or arrivals from the UK, will be subject to a compulsory 14-day coronavirus quarantine until at least July 24. 
Although the government is slowly lifting lockdown measures, with car journeys of up to 100 kilometers now allowed and beaches beginning to reopen, officials have made it clear the country is in no hurry to ease border restrictions for international travelers.
""Since the start of the crisis, the closure of the borders is the rule, and the authorization to cross a border is the exception. 
""What is good for tourism is often good for France, what strikes tourism strikes France,"" he said during a news conference.
Although some businesses have been given permission to reopen, the country's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafés are to remain closed at least until June 2.
Even then, it's unlikely establishments in Paris, which has been marked as a coronavirus ""red zone"" by officials, will be allowed to open any time soon.
It was announced on May 29 that the country's most visited museum, the Louvre, will reopen July 6. 
""Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,"" added Philippe. ""Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.""
He went on to state that residents can take holidays within France during July and August.
The country's hotels will be reliant on domestic tourism once they do reopen, as all signs suggest international travelers will not be able to enter for the foreseeable future.
""When the lockdown measures soften, French tourists are likely to want to stay close to home in the short term,"" a spokesperson for French hotel chain Accor told CNN Travel earlier this month.
""It will be the moment for them to rediscover their own country and we will be there to welcome them.""
Tourism accounts for almost 20% of Greece's gross domestic product, as well as one in five jobs, so it's perhaps no surprise the Mediterranean nation is angling to reopen to tourists as soon as it possibly can.
The European country, which managed to keep its coronavirus case numbers low by implementing a strict lockdown early on, plans to allow travelers back in on June 15.
""The tourism period begins on June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on May 20.
""Let us make this summer the epilogue of the [Covid-19] crisis,"" he added.
Mitsotakis went on to state that direct international flights to Greek destinations will slowly resume from July 1, and tourists will no longer be expected to take a Covid-19 test or go into quarantine on arrival.
However, Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis has indicated health officials will conduct spot tests when necessary.
""The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you've had in previous years,"" Mitsotakis told CNN earlier this month.
""Maybe no bars may be open, or no tight crowds, but you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece -- provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path.""
Bars and restaurants have also been allowed to take up business again, while city hotels are scheduled to reopen on June 1, followed by seasonal hotels in July.
All international passengers had previously been required to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival or go into quarantine for 14 days.
Mitsotakis had suggested tourists would be required to undergo testing before their visit as a further precaution in the future, but it seems this is no longer the case.
Although nonessential travel to Germany is prohibited at present, the land of poets and thinkers intends to lift restrictions for EU countries from June 15, according to German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.
Officials are also considering allowing entry to visitors from Turkey, the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, although a final decision is yet to be made.
The proposal was listed in a paper called ""Criteria for the Enabling of intra-European Tourism,"" which suggested the current travel warnings would be replaced by individual travel advice relating to each country. 
""The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries,"" it reads.
The Austria/Germany land border is also reopening -- travel between Austria and Germany will be possible from June 15 -- and restrictions around the country are being relaxed.
While bars are still closed, restaurants began reopening on May 18, while hotels were permitted to open up again from May 29.
Mexico is aiming to welcome visitors back within weeks.
While the nation remains in lockdown, with hotels and restaurants yet to recommence business, officials are planning to reopen the country bit by bit in order to get things back on track.
""The target is domestic travelers first, followed by travelers from the US and Canada and then the rest of the world.
The border between the US and Mexico border is closed to ""nonessential"" travel until at least June 22 and most international flights in and out of Mexico's key airports are currently suspended or significantly reduced.
However, Delta Air Lines will be increasing and/or resuming various services from the US to Cancun, Mexico City Los Cabos and Puerta Vallarta in the coming weeks.
Quintana Roo, a state on the Caribbean side of Mexico that's home to the likes of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, hopes to reopen in mid-June, according to Marisol Vanegas, the state's tourism secretary. 
""We want to revive tourism and expect to start opening sights and hotels sometime between June 10 and 15 but don't know which ones yet,"" she says. 
""It depends on what the federal government allows us to do.""
Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, says he hopes to be able to accept both international and domestic travelers by August and September.
However, beach destination Riviera Nayarit, situated north of Puerta Vallarta, currently has no immediate plans to bring back tourists, according to Richard Zarkin, the public relations manager for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Turkey made over $34.5 billion from tourism in 2019, and the transcontinental country is eager to get back in business.
According to Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the destination plans to restart domestic tourism by the close of May and hopes to receive international visitors from mid-June.
The country has set out new guidelines for its hotels and resort facilities, such as temperature checks at entrances and at least 12 hours of room ventilation after checkout. Guests will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.
""The more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,"" Tourism Minister Mehmet Ersoy told Reuters earlier this month while revealing plans to open around half of Turkey's hotels this year.
Meanwhile, restrictions on intercity travel have been lifted, while restaurants, cafes, parks and sports facilities are permitted to reopen from June 1, along with beaches and museums.
Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, one of the world's largest markets, is also preparing to reopen for the first time in two months on June 1.
Italy has been one of the destinations worst hit by the pandemic, but the hugely popular European country is keen to get its tourism industry up and running now that infection rates have slowed down.
Travelers from the EU, along with the UK and the microstates and principalities of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, will be allowed to enter without having to go into quarantine starting June 3, in a move the government has described as a ""calculated risk."" 
""We have to accept it; otherwise, we will never be able to start up again.""
Visitors were previously required to undergo a two-week quarantine before being allowed entry.
All museums, including Rome's Vatican Museums, have been slowly reopening throughout May with strict social-distancing rules. Bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with reduced numbers of diners as well as plastic shields to divide customers, on May 18.
Spain's lockdown was one of the toughest in Europe, but restrictions are gently being lifted. Beaches set to reopen in June while hotels in some parts of the country have already been permitted to resume business.
From July 1, the European destination, which welcomed a record 84 million visitors in 2019, will grant EU travelers permission to enter without having to quarantine for two weeks.
""Come July, we will allow the arrival of foreign tourists to Spain under safe conditions,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at a recent news conference.
""We will guarantee that tourists are not at risk, and that they don't represent a risk (to Spain).""
While there's been little mention of opening borders to travelers beyond the EU, it's thought Spain is hoping to follow the lead of destinations such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic by establishing safe corridors, or a ""travel bubble,"" with nearby destinations that have managed to keep the outbreak under control.
""The issue of borders will be accompanied by the evolution of the health crisis.""
At present, it's mandatory for anyone 6 and older to wear face masks while in public, both indoors and outdoors, ""where it is not possible to maintain [an interpersonal] distance.""
It's already one of the most lavish destinations in the world, but the Maldives looks set to become even more expensive to visit once it reopens.
The island nation, made up of over 1,000 islands, closed its national borders and canceled all flights shortly after recording its first two coronavirus cases in March.
The Maldives has recorded around 1,457 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19 so far.
According to Minister of Tourism Ali Waheed, the country could be in the position to receive tourists by the end of 2020.
""Within the next three months, the Maldives will become the first Covid-19 free country in the Asia region hopefully,"" during an online Maldivian parliament meeting.
""We are conducting surveys to begin safe tourism when we reach that road.""
A phased reopening has been proposed that would see private jets and super yachts allowed entry from June 1, charter flights and private jets will be charged a $50,000 landing fee.
The government has also issued a ""Safe Tourism License"" for tourist facilities that comply with government legislation and certain safety requirements, such as having a certified medic readily available and holding an ""adequate stock"" of PPE equipment.
Travelers who made the trip over will need to have a confirmed booking with a tourist facility with a ""Safe Tourism Licence,"" as well as a special $100 tourist visa available to those committed to spending a minimum of 14 days in the country.
Visitors will also need to present a valid medical certificate confirming they are Covid-19 free. 
The Maldives received more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019 and had been expected numbers to rise to two million in 2020.
St. Lucia is one of several Caribbean islands trying for a tourism comeback.
The tropical destination, which closed its orders to foreign travelers on March 23, is to begin its phased reopening on June 4, when it will lift it borders to visitors from the United States.
Those traveling to the country must present ""certified proof"" of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight.
Visitors will also be subject to screening and temperature checks by port health authorities and must wear face masks and maintain social distancing during their visit. 
Officials are also bringing in new safety measures for taxis to separate drivers and passengers.
""Our new protocols have been carefully crafted and will build confidence among travelers and our citizens,"" Minister of Tourism Dominic Fedee said in a statement. 
""The government of Saint Lucia remains resolved to protect both lives and livelihoods as it jump starts its economy.""
Local businesses have also been allowed to reopen, provided they have appropriate cleaning measures and social distancing measures in place.
Details of the second phase of the island's reopening, which is to begin on August 1, will be announced in the coming weeks.
Portugal is still in the process of relaxing lockdown restrictions, allowing restaurants, museums and coffee shops to reopen at reduced capacity from mid-May.
But the European country is keen to revive its struggling tourism industry, with Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva recently declaring ""tourists are welcome.""
While visitors from outside the EU are banned until at least June 15, some routes in and out of Portuguese-speaking nations such as Brazil are still operating.
The land border between Portugal and Spain, which has been closed to tourists since March, is unlikely to reopen until EU travel restrictions are lifted.
""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said earlier this month.
Although the prospect of reopening to international tourists appears to be a little while off, officials are putting measures in place to ensure foreign travelers will feel confident to return once they're able to.
Rita Marques, the country's Secretary of State for Tourism, has launched a ""don't cancel, postpone"" scheme, allowing tourists to reschedule any pre-arranged holidays to Portugal until the close of 2021.
This is valid for all bookings made through accredited travel agencies, along with hotels or Airbnbs, for trips scheduled between March 13 and September 30, 2020.
In addition, national tourism authority Turismo de Portugal has created a free hygiene-certification stamp to distinguish ""Clean &amp; Safe"" tourism enterprises to increase visitors' confidence.
Businesses will have to comply with hygiene and cleaning requirements for the prevention and control of Covid-19 to receive the stamp, which is valid for one year.
According to Santos Silva, Portugal's airports will soon be introducing health checks for arrivals, but visitors will not be subject to a mandatory quarantine.
The Caribbean island of Aruba is planning to open its doors to travelers once again at some point between June 15 and July 1.
However, the visitor's bureau for the Caribbean island, which has reported just over 100 confirmed coronavirus cases, says this ""tentative"" date may change if Aruba opts to ""consider additional precautionary measures as needed."" 
Although there's no mention of any Covid-19 testing requirements for arrivals, tourists will be required to undergo temperature checks on arrival.
While nonessential businesses including shopping malls, cinemas, beauty salons and outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen on May 25, the island country's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place.
This means such establishments are required to close by 10 p.m. every day.
In addition, the department of Public Health has introduced the ""Aruba Health &amp; Happiness Code,"" a mandatory cleaning and hygiene certification program for all businesses related to tourism in the country.
But the country was forced to close its winter resorts and place a ban on all foreign visitors back in March because of the crisis.
Eager to revive its tourism sector, the country's government says it plans to reopen to international travelers on July 1.
The next stage will allow for domestic travel in special ""safe"" tourism zones, while the final stage involves reopening borders and resuming some flights.
""[The] tourism sector will be first to which emergency relief measures will apply.""
While other destinations are relaxing travel restrictions and bringing in measures to lure travelers back, the UK is choosing to enact stricter regulations. 
Under the new rules, all arrivals will have to provide an address, at which they must remain for two weeks.
Those who break the rules will be subject to fines of up to $1,218.
The decision, which is to be reviewed every three weeks, has quashed any hopes of rescuing international tourism here in the coming weeks.
It's thought the move may discourage airlines from restarting flight operations swiftly, while officials have warned there's little chance of UK residents being able to go abroad this summer.
""I'm saying, right now you can't travel abroad,"" Transport Minister Grant Shapps said during a BBC television interview when asked whether UK citizens should book flights in July. 
""If you are booking it, you are clearly by very nature taking a chance of where the direction of this virus goes and therefore where the travel advice is in the future.""
At present, hotels are primed to open in early July, but as EU border restrictions are still in place, it's likely the UK will be focusing on domestic travel for now.
Luxury country house hotel Beaverbrook is one of many establishments eagerly waiting to be given the go ahead to open their doors again while implementing major changes to protect guests and staff.
""We're still awaiting further clarity from the government on when the hotel can reopen, but we have been working behind the scenes to adapt our operations to ensure extra safety for both our staff and guests when we do,"" a spokesperson from the Surrey hotel told CNN Travel earlier this month.
""All visitors and staff will be required to submit a temperature check on arrival and be asked to sanitize their hands when entering all buildings on the estate.

""Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills. Just like nobody should have to choose between staying home with Covid-19 symptoms or being able to afford rent or groceries,"" Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Monday. 
As of Monday, Canada has reported more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus and 6,545 related deaths. 
For those infected, sick leave is usually a provincial jurisdiction, which complicates the national effort. 
Trudeau said putting the necessary mechanisms in place for a national paid sick leave program would be challenging, but his government and the provinces are determined to try. 
""When the Fall comes and flu season starts up we don't want people who develop a sniffle to suddenly worry that while they really shouldn't go into work but they can't afford to not go into work and therefore the risk of contributing to a wave significantly, could be a real problem,"" Trudeau said. 
Canada's top doctor repeated her assertion Monday that a second wave of the virus could be worse than the first and encouraged public health officials to build up capacity for testing, hospital beds and personal protective equipment in order to prepare. 
""I think you can never be overly prepared and we have to just keep going with some of these capacity developments and that goes for lab testing as well,"" said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer during a press conference Monday. 
In hopes of managing the spread of the virus into the country, Trudeau announced last week that the border with the United States will continue to be closed until at least June 21. Trudeau called the border, which has been closed since March 21, a clear point of ""vulnerability"" for Canada.
The prohibition of international travelers and quarantine of returning Canadians is the only thing that has allowed Canada to manage its first wave of coronavirus, Tam said."

Those states are not reporting probable cases, according to the daily case count listed on the CDC's website. Probable cases include those that show evidence of an infection without the confirmation of a lab test and cases where coronavirus was listed as a cause or contributing cause of death but are not confirmed with a lab test. 
Some of the states with the largest populations -- like California, Florida, New York and Texas -- are among those listed as not reporting probable cases, despite CDC guidance that they should be included in the case count. 
This comes as 26 states see an increased or steady rate of new cases. Accurate rates of new cases are among the metrics that help officials track how the disease is spreading in the US and make decisions about how to reopen and loosen restrictions put in place to mitigate its impact. 
More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 111,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Though coronavirus reporting guidelines are voluntary, states not reporting probable cases likely undercount the number of people infected and make it difficult for officials to get the true picture of where the nation stands in the midst of a pandemic that has rocked almost every aspect of life. 
How will students go back to school?
Schools have been especially upended, with students across the country not having been on campus in months.
While many local governments have expressed that the path forward for the fall is unclear, North Carolina and California have released guidelines for reopening schools.
Though California's 1,000 school districts will make theirown decision about how and when to resume in-classroom learning, the state's Department of Education released a 62-page guidebook Monday to help them plan ahead of time.
The guide gives options for staggered schedules, ongoing distance learning, and models that combine both. It also directs educators to teach proper handwashing and limits the number of students allowed on buses to prevent the virus from breaking out in schools. 
""This guidance is only as good as what's implemented,"" State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said in a press conference. ""We expect it will be adjusted as we go.""
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also released health guidance for reopening schools Monday, telling reporters that this school year will be unlike any other.
""Students and staff will be screened for illness before they enter the school. Children will be asked to stay distant from classmates. They won't be sharing pencils or textbooks and there will be a lot of cleaning,"" he said.
Openings will be dependent on health metrics, he said. But North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Mandy Cohen said during a press conference Mondaythat she's concerned the state's positive tests are among the highest in the nation.
""These trends moving in the wrong direction is a signal we need to take very seriously,"" Cohen said.
California takes steps back toward normal 
While North Carolina is seeing cases rise, California -- with trends holding steady -- is beginning to reopen some recreational sites.
The state, which has been among those most affected, has 
Yosemite National Park, which has been off limits to visitors since March 20, will reopen to the public Thursday.
It will aim to admit only half of its average visitor rate, beginning by allowing 1,700 vehicle passes each day, according a statement from park spokesman Jamie Richards.
""There is no place like Yosemite, and we can't wait to welcome visitors back,"" said Acting Superintendent Cicely Muldoon. ""It's going to be a different kind of summer, and we will continue to work hand in hand with our gateway communities to protect community health and restore access to Yosemite National Park.""
As early as Friday, indoor California movie theaters may reopen, according to guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) released on Monday.
Theaters are required to limit attendees to 25% of capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower.
Theaters will also need to reconfigure seats to ensure physical distancing between moviegoers, who must wear face coverings when not eating or drinking to mitigate virus spread, the guidance says. 
Concerns raise in new states
As many of the hardest hit states begin to recover from the pandemic, cases rise elsewhere.
Vermont, where new cases are increasing, had an outbreak reported Friday with at least 62 people infected near Winooski, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said. Dozens of children were among those infected, and more than 1,000 people in the state went to get tested following the outbreak, Levine said. 
Vermont State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso said the outbreak was spread by friends and relatives, and through contact tracing it appears to be well-contained.
In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential."" The positive test rate doubled from one day to the next to 18.5%, she tweeted over the weekend.
""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health tweeted.
In the last week, Texas and Arizona have seen spikes in cases, with both reporting more than 1,000 new cases in one day. 
Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs -- including Arkansas State University, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.

It was already an unforgettable day for owner David Fernandez, who for weeks had looked forward to reopening after the coronavirus stay-at-home order was lifted. 
But one customer's welcome back gift made the restaurant's return even more special for Fernandez and his employees. 
A man and his family, who had visited the restaurant before, on Friday ordered a filet mignon, scallops, grilled steak and other items. The check came out to a hefty $337. But then the customer asked his server to double charge him. 
The server, 18-year-old Josh Pikoff, had never received such a request, so he brought out Fernandez to help. 
""He said charge me double for everything and I asked, 'Are you sure?' Fernandez recalled. ""He said, 'yes.'
But after the customer received his updated check with the double charge, he then added a $300 tip for Pikoff and another $1,000 ""for the house,"" according to a picture of the check. His total came out to be $2,029. 
""I was really shocked at first because I didn't understand why he was giving it to me,"" Pikoff told CNN. ""But he said that he was extremely grateful that we were open and putting ourselves at risk to serve the community."" 
""I didn't really know what to say,"" Fernandez told CNN. ""It was extremely generous and I was just so wowed by it.""
The Frog &amp; The Bull, an Iberian-inspired tapas restaurant, wasn't even five-months-old when the coronavirus pandemic led to an early closure on St. Patrick's Day. 
Like most of the restaurant industry in the US, the restaurant was hit hard due to the coronavirus crisis, and Fernandez had to lay off most of his employees. 
The skeleton staff tried to keep the restaurant going with a carryout and delivery menu. But the momentum the restaurant had gained in its first five months was lost, and Fernandez said he and his staff were ""scraping for survival, literally from payroll to payroll.""
""We literally overnight reinvented ourselves from an upscale casual dining establishment into what I told my executive chef had to be a badass food truck without wheels,"" Fernandez said.
So when Texas' stay-at-home order expired on April 30 and establishments started opening back up Friday, Fernandez was excited. 
""We were well prepared to deal with all the advisories,"" he said. ""For example, we can only seat 25% max capacity so we have a very strict seating scheme that's timed out to keep people safe."" 
The extra money from the generous customer will help the restaurant get back on track with its bills, Fernandez said. 
While he doesn't know any further details about the customer, Fernandez said he will make sure the customer is well taken care of the next time he comes around."

 (CNN)For a minute there, it looked like we were all in this together. And then we weren't.
From embracing stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of Covid-19, we've come to see armed protesters storm state capitols to end the lockdown. Why has the attitude toward the pandemic crisis shifted so greatly?
Data emerged that, for the first time, specified infection and death rates by race -- and the face of the pandemic changed. It became Black. And the fragile sense of social solidarity that was keeping millions of Americans at home to protect themselves and each other began to crumble.
Throughout the 20th century -- and even today -- as Black people moved into previously segregated neighborhoods, the existing white residents moved out in large numbers. The coronavirus pandemic and worldwide lockdowns may be new to the globe, but the racial dynamics underlying our nation's response are wearyingly familiar.
I was not surprised to learn that Black people are the hardest-hit by the virus or the least-served by the institutions, systems, and leaders charged with addressing the pandemic. African Americans, who comprise 13% of the US population, make up nearly 28% of Covid-19 cases. 
We knew that people of color are overrepresented in poorly paid but suddenly essential frontline jobs, that African Americans are more likely to live in crowded housing making social distance difficult. We recognized that Black people tend to live in highly polluted neighborhoods resulting in higher rates than white people of the respiratory conditions that make patients most vulnerable to dying from Covid-19.
It wasn't a surprise to many of us that the shortage of hospitals and health care providers serving our communities, combined with the biased assumptions that lead doctors to undertreat Black people's pain and heart attacks, would result in African Americans finding it harder to get tested and treated. 
And we knew that as soon as the pandemic became racialized, many Americans would no longer be willing to make sacrifices in order to address a crisis that suddenly seemed to be not about ""us"" but about ""them."" 
Take a look at the timeline. On April 8, the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report showing that Black people were dramatically over-represented among Covid-19 patients sick enough to be hospitalized.
Five days later, on April 13, a small but furious group of protesters, virtually all white, some wearing MAGA hats, gathered outside the Ohio statehouse to demand Gov. Mike DeWine reopen the state.
It didn't stop there. From Texas to North Carolina the protesters gathered -- organized by right-wing groups and supported by Republican legislators, including the president -- many wearing Trump gear, and some displaying Confederate flags and brandishing automatic weapons. The same scene repeated on April 30 in Michigan, when armed protesters stormed the state house and tried to push their way in. 
A Fox Nation host likened the nation's stay-at-home orders to ""willful slavery"" in a since-deleted tweet. A state senator in Michigan made the connection eloquently but silently, by wearing onto the legislative floor a face mask that resembled the Confederate flag.
This racialization of public events is nothing new. From former President Richard Nixon's war on drugs, which a top aide later acknowledged was designed to criminalize Nixon's ""two enemies: the antiwar left and black people;"" to former President George H.W. Bush's use in 1988 of the infamous ""Willie Horton"" campaign ad, which became the very definition of a racist dog whistle; to the Russians swamping social media with posts about the Black Lives Matter movement in order to drive white voters to Trump in 2016, racist scare tactics have long been used to pit Americans against one another. During this pandemic, racism has already been weaponized to splinter any national unity. 
Lives and livelihoods are at stake, most acutely in Black and brown communities -- but so is our democracy. We are seeing high levels of scarcity, with extreme unemployment numbers, while the nation's chief executive uses his bully pulpit to sow division and demonize otherness. With the elections approaching, our country could sink to a level of tribalism that leads to violence. 
We could make this another instance of white flight -- from public health realities, from collective responsibility, from the recognition that the pandemic imperils people of all colors and communities. Or we could answer the call to rise together and fight the pandemic, using science and reason as our guides and democracy as our beacon.
Our nation's fractured history does not need to be our destiny. As the virus burns through our communities, upending life as we knew it, let's take this chance to reject the habits of hatred and move forward together, rebuilding our country and a future in which health and economic mobility are within reach for us all."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 (CNN)Washing your hands frequently, with plenty of water and soap, is one of the simplest and most effective measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Yet due to a lack of water supply and indoor plumbing, three-quarters of households in the developing world won't be able to follow this advice, Tim Wainwright of the nonprofit WaterAid told The Guardian, because they lack some place to wash with soap and water. How will they cope when the pandemic escalates and there is no clean water to help stop contagion?
This is not a faraway problem. The pandemic may be raging in Europe and the US, but it is spreading across Asia, Africa and Latin America, from where it may yet return to strike the Northern Hemisphere again. This pandemic is a global threat, and it will not be defeated until our most vulnerable communities are safe. One of the crucial ways of keeping them safe is to ensure they have access to safe water and sanitation; never has the sixth UN Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to ensure just this by 2030, been more vital for saving and protecting lives. 
Here is the scale of the problem: Every year, 1.5 million young children die of preventable infectious diseases such as diarrhea because of poor sanitation, according to UNICEF. One out of every three humans on our planet -- some 2.2 billion people -- lack access to safe drinking water, and six out of 10 lack access to proper sanitation, meaning toilets or safely managed sewage systems. Residents of the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, can share one pit latrine with over 100 people. In Dharavi, Asia's largest urban slum located in Mumbai, India, 80% of its seven million residents have no running water, the National Observer has noted. What hope do they have of washing their hands frequently?
Even before Covid-19 struck, the UN called water scarcity ""the scourge of the earth."" Because of climate change and the depletion of fresh water resources, two-thirds of humanity could be living in water-stressed areas (facing water shortfalls not as severe as those deemed water ""scarce"") just five years from now, according to UN projections. Two years ago, Cape Town in South Africa came perilously close to ""Day Zero"" -- the day its 3.7 million residents would run out of water. Strict water rationing has been the order of the day ever since. Water scarcity increases the burden on the poorest of the poor -- women who must walk for miles to find water and carry it back to their homes. And, of course, water scarcity makes the challenge of delivering clean water and sanitation much more complex.
 The problem, shockingly, is not confined to poor countries. More than two million Americans live without running water, indoor plumbing or wastewater treatment, according to the nonprofits Dig Deep and the US Water Alliance. A report by Food &amp; Water Watch found that, in 2016, 15 million Americans had their water shut off due to an inability to pay water bills -- one out of every 20 households across the country. The US neither provides a constitutional right to water nor recognizes the UN Human Right to Water and Sanitation.
The truth is that in every country, water infrastructure -- where it is present -- is deteriorating. Underinvestment in water networks and treatment facilities has been the norm for decades. We are a long way off being able to meet the UN's water goals for 2030.
But investing in clean water infrastructure saves lives, and we must seize this moment to ramp up investment in safe water and sanitation. Spending on water is not just the right thing to do; it's also the smart thing to do.
The World Resources Institute estimates that it would cost just over 1% of global GDP to invest in the infrastructure required to provide clean water for all countries by 2030. By contrast, diseases linked to contaminated water cost many countries up to 5% of GDP due to poor health and lost productivity.
According to the UN, every $1 invested in safe drinking water in urban areas yields more than $3 in saved medical costs and added productivity, on average. For every $1 invested in basic sanitation, society makes $2.50 back. The return is higher in rural areas, with $7 gained or saved for every $1 invested in clean drinking water.
If countries have neglected to invest in their water security up to now, it is mostly because they have not seen it as a priority, either from a health or economic point of view. Covid-19 changes that equation. The human and economic cost of a pandemic aggravated by water scarcity could be catastrophic. 
Without clean water and proper sanitation, we will not be able to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. Like Covid-19, water scarcity is a global problem that needs collective action. Never has there been a more urgent time to address the world's water crisis."

With nothing else to try, doctors turned to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, a complicated technique that's not widely available in the United States. 
The ECMO machine, often called the ""highest form of life support,"" uses a pump to circulate a patient's blood through an artificial lung. The artificial lung adds oxygen and takes out carbon dioxide before the blood is returned to the patient. ECMO helps provide enough oxygen to a patient while allowing time for the lungs or heart to rest and heal.
The process is challenging and increases the patient's risk for clotting and bleeding, but doctors in the United States and around the world are using it to treat some severe cases of Covid-19.
""I'm pretty sure (that) without ECMO, he wouldn't be with us today,"" said Dr. Ross Bremner, who treated Viddal at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center. 
'He most likely would have died,' doctor says
Viddal, a father of three, considered himself an active and healthy person. He had his gall bladder removed and suffered a common cold once in a while, but he never imagined he would spend nearly two months hospitalized. 
After returning from a trip to Colombia, Viddal developed a cough. Within days, he had difficulties breathing and developed a fever. He became worried and went to the hospital after he checked his oxygen levels and they kept dropping.
""I was taking shallow breaths,"" Viddal said. ""I was hoping that I would recover and it would resolve (itself).""
Viddal says he was intubated one or two days after he was admitted in the hospital. But no one knew he had Covid-19 for some time. 
He says he tested negative for the virus three times when they used nasal swabs and finally tested positive when doctors took a sample from his lungs. Bremner, the executive director for the Norton Thoracic Institute at St. Joseph's, says the virus had moved to Viddal's lungs.
Viddal was placed on the ECMO machine for 16 days, Bremner says, and developed other complications, including blood clots, bleeding from his main airway, tension pneumothorax -- a dangerous accumulation of air -- and deep vein thrombosis. 
""It was really a tough situation,"" Bremner said. ""We know that, you know, about half of the patients who go on ECMO for Covid (19) don't survive and he certainly had many brushes with death.""
By the time Viddal was taken off the ECMO machine and the ventilator, he had lost 50 pounds and could barely move. Despite everything, he says he didn't have heart, kidney or liver damage. 
""I feel truly blessed that I was able to get onto that intervention to help save my life,"" Viddal said.
More patients are being treated with ECMO
At the time, Viddal was only the second Covid-19 patient in Arizona to be placed on ECMO therapy, according to the Dignity Health hospital system. 
Bremner said his team had mostly used the ECMO machine for organ transplants and to treat some severe cases of H1N1 influenza.
""It's not that common to use ECMO in other viral illnesses,"" Bremner said. 
The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, an international nonprofit consortium of health care institutions that evaluates therapies to support failing organ systems, has been tracking patients with severe cases of Covid-19.
So far, at least 1,006 people who tested positive for Covid-19 or are suspected of having the virus have been placed on an ECMO machine in hospitals worldwide, ELSO says.
Of the 260 patients in North America who have been put on an ECMO machine and then removed from it, 144, or 55% survived, the organization says.
The US Food and Drug Administration issued guidance in April to help expand the availability of equipment used for ECMO therapy for coronavirus patients. 
The agency says long-term extracorporeal oxygenation ""can be an important tool for treating patients"" and the FDA ""recognizes the importance and utility of increased availability of extracorporeal oxygenation devices for patients during the COVID-19 public health emergency.""
Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health said it has not issued guidance about the routine use of this treatment, saying ""there is no conclusive evidence that ECMO is responsible for better clinical outcomes in patients who received ECMO than in patients who did not receive ECMO.""
