# COVID-19-Misinformation-Classificaton-System

Since the discovery of the novel corornavirus-2019, there has been a lot of misinformation surrounding it. This includes the origin of the virus, the fatalness of it, the vaccine efficacy, and most recently the necessity of COVID-19 booster shot. Much of the misinformation surrounding the vaccine is extremely harmful to groups such as those of Chinese/Asian descent, medical proffesionals, WHO and CDC employees, those who are immunocompromised, and many more. Trialing many different machine learning models, we aim to create a useful classifer to predict whether a news article - given just the title or full text - is reliable or not (True or Fake). 

### PLEASE NOTE: The models as they are currently published are for educational purposed only and should not to be used as a fact-checking substitute by public and/or private organizations. 

## The Data 
 The data used for this analysis is a mixure of previously coded datasets, as well as newly encoded datasets by our team. 
 The code we gathered from existing sources can be found at the following sites:
 
  https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/covid-19-fake-news-infodemic-research-dataset-covid19-fnir-dataset
  
  https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zwfdmp5syg/1

All data sets, along with the full data set can be found in our GitHub repository, along with all the cleaning code.


## The Models 
  Please be sure to comment out the GridSearchCV portions of the code, and they will significantly slow down execution time.
