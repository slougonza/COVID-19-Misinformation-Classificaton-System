# COVID-19-Misinformation-Classificaton-System

Since the discovery of the novel corornavirus-2019, there has been a lot of misinformation surrounding it. This includes the origin of the virus, the fatalness of it, the vaccine efficacy, and most recently the necessity of COVID-19 booster shot. Much of the misinformation surrounding the vaccine is extremely harmful to groups such as those of Chinese/Asian descent, medical proffesionals, WHO and CDC employees, those who are immunocompromised, and many more. Trialing many different machine learning models, we aim to create a useful classifer to predict whether a news article - given just the title or full text - is reliable or not (True or Fake). 

**PLEASE NOTE: The models as they are currently published are for educational purposed only and should not to be used as a fact-checking substitute by public and/or private organizations. **
