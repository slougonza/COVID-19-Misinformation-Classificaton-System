# COVID-19 Misinformation Classification System: An Analysis of Binary Classifiers to Detect U.S. COVID-19 Misinformation in Social Media and News Articles 

![covid-19 graphic2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79933773/146621222-ab5e0984-6f27-492f-b49b-d51c15b28767.png)

Since the discovery of the novel corornavirus-2019, there has been a lot of misinformation surrounding it. This includes the origin of the virus, the fatalness of it, the vaccine efficacy, and most recently the necessity of COVID-19 booster shot. Much of the misinformation surrounding the vaccine is extremely harmful to groups such as those of Chinese/Asian descent, medical proffesionals, WHO and CDC employees, those who are immunocompromised, and many more. Trialing many different machine learning models, we aim to create a useful classifer to predict whether a news article - given just the title or full text - is reliable or not (True or Fake).

 - **LSTM.py:** Long Short Term Memory Model
 - **BERT.py:** Bert deep learning model
  
# Getting Started 

Only the following 3 packages are needed to install in the Python 3 environment of your choice:
```
!pip install -U gensim
!pip install torch
!pip install transformers
```
# The Data 
 The data used for this analysis is a mixure of previously coded datasets, as well as newly encoded datasets by our team. 
 The code we gathered from existing sources can be found at the following sites:
 
 -  https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/covid-19-fake-news-infodemic-research-dataset-covid19-fnir-dataset
 -  https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zwfdmp5syg/1 
 -  https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/esoc-covid-19-misinformation-dataset

All data sets, along with the final, combined dataset **"cleaned_df.csv"** can be found in our GitHub repository.


# Model Performance  
  
  1. Amoung our simple machine learning classifiers, our "soft" VotingClassifer trained on a LogisticRegression classifier, a RandomForestClassifier, and a    GradientBoostingClassifier produced the highest F1 score at **83.88%**. 
  2. Our LSTM Model, which included hyperparamters from extremely in-depth hypertuning, reached a final accuracy of 81%
  3. Our BERT deep learning model scored an 89%, BUT - his close cousin roBERTa reached an F1 score of a whopping **95%**! A HUGE improvment!
